Searching for bargains after a four-day selloff, buyers returned to Wall Street Tuesday, giving the market a modest lift. A weaker-than expected report on manufacturing from the Institute Supply Management limited the market's gains, as did the ever-present anxiety about the war with Iraq. In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.24, or 0.6 percent, at 8,037.37, having suffered a four-day loss of 288.10 and a first-quarter drop of 4.2 percent. The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.69, or 0.6 percent, to 1,348.86. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 5.47, or 0.6 percent, to 853.65. Wall Street's advance was modest compared with the steep four-day declines and investors were tentative amid ongoing worries about war with Iraq. Wall Street is also on edge about first-quarter earnings that companies will report later this month. Tuesday's economic news also kept the market's gains in check. The Institute for Supply Management reported that business at U.S. factories decreased for the first time in five months. The institue blamed the war for a plunge in new orders to manufacturers. The group's index of business activity fell to 46.2 in March, slipping from February's 50.5 reading. The report was worrisome for two reasons: A reading below 50 means manufacturing activity is contracting, and it was weaker than the 49 level that economists predicted. Analysts said the market was able to shake off the disappointing economic news only because investors were interested in picking up bargain-priced stocks, not because of renewed confidence in the economy or the market. SBC Communications rose 56 cents to $20.62 after Legg Mason raised its recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from ``hold.'' American Airlines parent AMR advanced 87 cents to $2.97 on upgrades from Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Best Buy fell 64 cents to $23.38 after the electronics retailer cut its first-quarter earnings outlook, although its fourth-quarter profits beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners more than 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange where trading was light as it has been for months due to war worries. Volume totaled 163.02 million shares, compared with 157.25 million at the same point Monday. The Russell 2000 index, the barometer of smaller company stocks, rose 1.03, or 0.3 percent, to 365.57. ^ _ _ _ _ On the Net: New York Stock Exchange: http://www.nyse.com Nasdaq Stock Market: http://www.nasdaq.com
