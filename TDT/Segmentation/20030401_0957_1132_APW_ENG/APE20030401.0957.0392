Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni on Tuesday confronted suspected members of a Greek terror group accused of murdering her husband and described them as ``cowardly killers.'' Bakoyianni is the latest Greek politician to testify against alleged members of the far-left group November 17, on trial for 23 murders, dozens of bombings and scores of armed robberies. The mayor's late husband, Pavlos Bakoyiannis, a journalist and ranking member of Greece's center-right New Democracy party, was shot dead in 1989 outside his Athens office. She remarried in 1998. Turning to the suspects in court Tuesday, Bakoyianni described them as ``unmanly and cowardly killers, low-quality human beings ... with no genuine political motives.'' November 17 is named after a student revolt in 1973 that helped topple a dictatorship the following year. The group is accused of killing four American officials, diplomats from Britain and Turkey, as well as Greek politicians, leading businessmen and senior judges. The group eluded police from 1975 until it was exposed last year by a bungled bomb attack. Nineteen suspects _ 18 men and one woman _ are on trial. Nine defendants have so far been identified in witness testimony as participating in attacks. Bakoyianni, 49, began her career in politics after her husband's murder. She was elected mayor in a landslide victory last year. (str/dg/pq/tr)
