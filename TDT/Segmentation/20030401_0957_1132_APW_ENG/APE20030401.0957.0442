European countries stepped up security at airports and an exhibition Tuesday as more cases of a deadly mystery illness from Asia were reported in Germany and Spain. Medical experts are looking for travelers _ both arriving and departing _ with symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome at airports in countries from Russia to Spain. SARS has so far killed at least 63 people and sickened more than 1,600 worldwide. Early symptoms include fever, dry cough and breathing difficulties. A fourth case of the disease was confirmed by authorities in Germany on Tuesday, while Spain reported the first suspected case there since a false alarm last month. There are already three suspected cases in Britain, three in Italy, two in Belgium and one in Slovenia. Switzerland records three ``probable'' and four ``suspected'' cases. Most of the victims are on the road to recovery, but WHO says the disease is fatal in about 4 percent of cases. Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor working for the World Health Organization who was the first to identify the disease in Vietnam, died himself from SARS last Saturday in Thailand. So far all the cases in Europe have been among people who recently traveled to Asia, and authorities are keen to keep it that way. Before the disease was identified, travelers returning from Asia passed it to family members in Canada. There are now 129 suspected cases in the country, and a health emergency has been declared in Toronto, Canada's largest city. The Swiss cabinet Tuesday banned exhibitors from affected countries _ about 350 people, or a sixth of the total _ from the Basel World Watch and Jewelry Fair, which opens Thursday. German health authorities have drawn up information for distribution to travelers before they board a plane bound for Frankfurt airport, the biggest air hub in continental Europe, and passengers arriving in France from the affected areas, including Toronto, are required to fill out forms with their contact details before leaving their flights. Governments also are stepping up their advice to citizens planning to travel to the affected region, with Belgium and Denmark on Tuesday becoming the latest countries to advise their citizens against travel. ``If the trip is not essential, it is better to postpone it,'' said Belgian Health Minister Jef Tavernier. Belgium's Prince Philippe has put off his trade mission to Vietnam, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed a trip to China, though Chinese authorities insist that is not linked to SARS. The Geneva-based WHO said Tuesday it is considering the unusual move of advising against travel to the most heavily affected areas _ Hong Kong and China as well as possibly Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan. That follows information from Hong Kong authorities that they have been unable to find a link between new cases there and patients previously infected. Hong Kong invoked a colonial-era law Tuesday to quarantine more than 240 people in countryside vacation camps in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease. ``It appears that there is now some environmental factor, such as water or sewage, which is taking this disease from one human to another,'' said Dr. David Heymann, WHO's infectious diseases chief. Some sporting events in the region have been canceled, including the women's world ice hockey championships scheduled to open this week in the Chinese capital, Beijing. World soccer body FIFA said it is still studying whether to make schedule changes, including an April 12 match between Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. The World Economic Forum said Tuesday it has postponed until fall a Beijing meeting of business and government leaders, and two major United Nations meetings planned for Beijing this month also are under threat. ^ _ _ _ _ _ &lt; On the net: http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en ^ (nk-agh) &lt;
