Albania's human rights record remained poor last year despite improvements in some areas, according to a U.S. State Department report released Tuesday in the Albanian capital. ``The overall performance of law enforcement remained weak,'' the U.S. government's 2002 annual human rights on Albania said, citing high levels of violent crime and widespread distrust for law enforcers. Many killings resulted from gang warfare or traditional ``blood feud'' vendettas, the report said. It also noted that police officers in some cases had committed human rights abuses. In general, though, police remained poorly trained even though the country receives international aid earmarked for police reform. ``Because of political pressure, intimidation, endemic corruption, bribery, and limited resources, the judiciary was unable to function independently and efficiently,'' the report said. Prison conditions also remained poor, and while new prisons have been opened in recent years, overcrowding remained a serious problem, the report said. Albanian police officers were also found to be involved in human trafficking, the report noted, calling this ``a serious problem.'' The government, which hopes to eventually join NATO and the European Union, has said it is trying to fight organized crime, trafficking and corruption. There was no immediate reaction on the report from the government. (ls/vg)
