Doctors examining Maurice Papon to verify he is too ill to return to prison for complicity in crimes against humanity will announce their findings April 14, judicial official said Tuesday. The medical experts examined the 92-year-old earlier this month and had been expected to release their decision on Tuesday. The sources did specify a reason for the delay. Papon was convicted in 1998 of complicity in crimes against humanity for playing a role in deporting Jews from southwest France during World War II. He began serving a 10-year sentence in 1999. He was released in September under a French law allowing early release for the ill and aging. Papon, who had heart bypass surgery and wears a pacemaker, had served only three years of his sentence. As part of his release, Papon must be periodically examined by experts to verify that he still qualifies for the plan. Papon was convicted for helping deport 1,690 Jews in the Bordeaux area to Nazi death camps. He fled to Switzerland after his conviction but was arrested and began serving his sentence in October 1999. During World War II, about 76,000 Jews, including 12,000 children, were deported from France, many to Auschwitz. Only 2,500 survived. (parf-jc-jg)
