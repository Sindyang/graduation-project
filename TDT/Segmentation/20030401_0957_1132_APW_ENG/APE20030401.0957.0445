Thrashers defenseman Chris Tamer was suspended indefinitely by the NHL for cross-checking Vladimir Orszagh of the Nashville Predators. Tamer had a hearing in New York on Monday and missed that night's game against the Rangers. A ruling will be made before Wednesday's game at Buffalo. Tamer drew a game misconduct on Saturday for intent to injure in the second period of the Thrashers' 3-2 victory at Nashville. He hit Orszagh in apparent retaliation for a hit on Dany Heatley by Nashville's Rem Murray. Orszagh left the game with a shoulder injury. With Tamer out, Kurtis Foster was recalled from Chicago of the AHL and made his NHL debut Monday night against the Rangers.
