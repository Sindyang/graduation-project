Finnair said Tuesday it doesn't expect to post a profit for 2003 because of travelers' heightened fear of flying as fighting in Iraq continues. The Helsinki-based airline also said it would start temporarily laying off workers in May, but didn't say how many. The guidance came a week after the airline began a 160 million euro (US$169.3 million) cost-cutting program to eliminate 1,200 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force of 10,800 through 2005. Those cuts will be permanent. For 2002, the airline reported a profit of 36.8 million euros, up from 7.1 million euros in 2001. At the time, it warned that 2003 would be a difficult year. Last year, 7 million passengers flew Finnair, down from 7.5 million in 2001. Shares of Finnair were down 0.16 euros (17 cents), or 4.5 percent, to close at 3.40 euros (US$3.71) in trading Tuesday on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Founded in 1923, Finnair is one of the world's oldest airlines. The government owns 58 percent of Finnair which flies to 50 destinations worldwide with a fleet of 60 aircraft. Finnair is a member of the OneWorld alliance, which includes American Airlines and British Airways. _ _ _ On the Net: Finnair: http://www.finnair.com (mpm)
