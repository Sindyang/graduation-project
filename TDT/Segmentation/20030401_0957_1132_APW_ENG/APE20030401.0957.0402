Business at American factories pulled back in March for the first time in five months as the start of the war in Iraq caused new orders to manufacturers to plunge, according to a new survey. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 46.2, slipping from February's 50.5 reading. A reading below 50 means manufacturing activity is contracting. Analysts had expected the war to cut into manufacturing, though not by this much. They had forecast that the index would fall to 49. The ISM, a private business group, said purchasing and supply executives focused on the war, soft demand and rising prices. The war appears to have slowed demand in a number of industries, including chemicals and industrial equipment, the survey said. ``March wasn't a good month for manufacturing, as the sector appears to have lost its momentum,'' said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the survey. New orders had been above the key 50 mark for six months, but dropped sharply in March to 46.2 percent. That's 6.1 percentage points lower than February's reading. Employment in the manufacturing sector failed again to recover in March, coming in below 50 for the 30th consecutive month. The index registered 42.1 percent last month. The ISM's production index fell 9.1 percentage points in March to 46.3 percent _ below the key 50 mark _ indicating a drop in business and ending 15 straight months of growth in production, the survey found. ``Supply managers continue to be challenged by business conditions,'' Ore said. ``The start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization.'' The ISM's index is closely followed by economists and market watchers because it gives an early reading on the health of the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers continued to see higher prices cutting into their bottom line last month. The ISM's prices index was up for a 13th month, with higher costs in energy, gasoline, paper and chemicals. Of the 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, only eight reported growth, including apparel, food, and wood and wood products. The index is based on a survey of managers who buy raw materials for manufacturing at companies across the country. ^ _ _ _ = On the Net: Manufacturing: http://www.ism.ws
