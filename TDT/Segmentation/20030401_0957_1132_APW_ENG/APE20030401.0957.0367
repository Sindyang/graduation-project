Indian states missed the deadline Tuesday to switch over to a new tax system as traders, fearing it will squeeze their profits and pinch consumers, shut their shops in protest for a second day. The government wanted to introduce a value added tax, or VAT, to replace varying sales tax systems across India's 38 states and federal territories from Tuesday. But only 12 states have passed legislation to implement the system, and none have published the laws, which means they cannot take effect. Announcing the deadline in the Feb. 28 budget, Finance Minister Jaswant Singh said the new system would bring India in line with developed countries' tax rules. Singh had said the federal government would offset revenue losses by some states during the transition phase. But state governments worry that the new tax will anger traders, who are an influential lobby group and an important source of donations for political parties. ``VAT will subject traders to more harassment by tax officials,'' said Sham Behave Misra, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, who also heads the All India Traders' Federation. Under the new tax system, traders would be required to routinely submit details of their sales and the tax they pay to authorities. They would also have to pay tax up front and later seek refunds of any portion that was overpaid. Misra said that will give tax officials the leverage to harass traders and seek bribes. Government officials deny this, arguing that the present system helps tax-evading traders, who sell products for cash and don't keep receipt books. A Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the traders' fears were unfounded and many had protested without looking at details of the new tax system, which many states have not yet made public. Later on Tuesday, the ministry called a meeting of state finance ministers next week to resolve the deadlock.
