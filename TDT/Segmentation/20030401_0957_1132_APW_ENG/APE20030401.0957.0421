Chanting anti-American slogans, hundreds filled the streets of this impoverished west African nation's capital on Tuesday to protest the U.S.-led war against Iraq. In Burkina Faso's first demonstration against the war, up to 1,000 people shouting ``Bush: Assassin'' marched to the United Nations' mission building to demand that U.S.-led forces leave Iraq. ``What is taking place in Iraq can happen to us and is even affecting us already,'' said march organizer Moise Sawadago _ who like many marchers blames the Iraq invasion for the country's recent 10 percent fuel-price hike. Many Muslims in the crowd cried ``Allah Akhbar,'' or ``God is Great.'' About 40 percent of Burkina Faso's 12 million people are Muslim. Heavily armed riot police looked on, but the march ended peacefully. No arrests or injuries were reported. Burkina Faso has seen five military coups since independence from France in 1960, including the bloody 1987 takeover that gave President Blaise Compaore control of the landlocked, resource-poor country. Compaore has since kept power through elections. (bo-nd-esh)
