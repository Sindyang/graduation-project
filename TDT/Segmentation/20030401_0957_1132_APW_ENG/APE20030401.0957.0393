Salman Khan, one of India's top movie stars, on Tuesday laughed over rival film actor Vivek Oberoi's allegation that Khan threatened his life. ``I have nothing to say about his allegations,'' Khan, 38, told The Associated Press, as he laughed uproariously over his cellphone about Oberoi's claim that Khan had repeatedly threatened to kill him. Oberoi said he had not filed any charges with police against Khan, known for his tough guy roles, but insisted he was threatened. ``He said he'd kill me. ... He called me 41 times in one night,'' Oberoi, 27, said in a press conference broadcast on major Indian television channels Tuesday. Oberoi gave no motive for why Khan would threaten him, but said he would take legal action if Khan called again. Oberoi, a rising star in the Indian film industry, called Bollywood, has appeared in four Hindi language movies. He won rave reviews for his latest, ``Dum'' or ``Strength,'' in which he played an average man who fights a corrupt police officer with mob links. Khan, a popular muscle-bound star, has appeared in some 20 blockbuster Hindi movies. His ratings took a beating after he was charged with culpable homicide, and drunken and reckless driving last October for the death of one man and injuries to three others when his car swerved onto a Bombay sidewalk. Khan has denied he was behind the wheel. If convicted he could be jailed up to 10 years.
