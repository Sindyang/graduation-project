Italian police have arrested four people _ one Egyptian, one Somali and two Iraqi Kurds _ who are suspected of having links with Islamic terrorist groups, anti-terrorism police said Tuesday. The arrests were sought by Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who has been leading investigations into suspected Islamic cells in Italy. Bruno Megale of Milan's anti-terrorism police confirmed the arrests but refused to say where or when the arrests were made or give other details, saying the probe was in progress. Italian dailies Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, reporting on the arrests that were apparently carried out Monday evening, said the men were suspected of belonging to an extremist Islamic group based in northern Iraq and called Ansar al-Islam. U.S. officials believe that Ansar al-Islam, a tiny Kurdish group, is linked to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's terror network. In a speech before the U.N. Security Council in February, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that bin Laden's man in Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, has set up a camp in a corner of northern Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam. Powell also said that Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against several countries, including Italy. Judge Guido Salvini, in his written approval for the arrest warrants, said the four were providing men for the training camp in northern Iraq, while also helping militants passing through Italy sneak into other European countries, such as Germany and Britain, Ap.Biscom, an Italian news agency reported. Two of the suspects were reportedly picked up in Milan and two in Parma, another northern Italian city. They were planning to leave the country, the reports said. The reports also said that at least seven other people were being investigated as part of the same probe. Corriere said that before the arrests, the suspects' telephone conversations had been tapped for months. The suspects were charged with subversive association aimed at international terrorism, as well as with forging documents and aiding illegal immigration, RAI state TV said. Dambruoso could not be reached for comment. The arrests were the latest in a series of raids that have brought dozens of suspected terrorists behind bars in Italy. Many of those suspects were later released for lack of evidence. Late last month, Dambruoso asked an Italian judge to indict 61 Egyptian on charges of criminal association. The international terrorism charge was introduced in Italy only after the Sept. 11 attacks, and therefore could not be used against the defendants in the case, which dates back to 1995. Dambruoso alleges that the suspects have provided logistic support to two terrorist organizations based in Egypt, al-Jihad and al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. (ar-fd)
