Lambasted for scoring only two goals against soccer minnow Liechtenstein, England's stars will be thankful to get a lucky 1-0 victory over World Cup semifinalist Turkey on Wednesday. It might not be enough to get the critics off their backs. But it will mean moving to the top of the group standings and getting back on course for a place in next year's European Championship finals. Team captain David Beckham said facing Group 7 leader Turkey at Sunderland's Stadium of Light is England's biggest game since last year's World Cup in Japan. ``All the players know it is,'' he said. ``Obviously we've had some big games since then but none as big as this. ``It's the biggest game of the group now. They've been playing well, they're top of the group, they've got nothing to lose. It's up to us to beat them and get the three points. ``We've got to respond,'' the Manchester United star said. ``There are critics out there and we want to show them we are capable of beating this team.'' If England produces a repeat of Saturday's tepid 2-0 performance against Liechtenstein it will be unlikely to defeat a high quality Turkish team that has virtually all its World Cup stars. The squad includes standout goalkeeper Rustu Recber of Fenerbahce, Galatasaray's attacking midfielder Hasan Sas, Inter Milan's Emre Belozoglu and English-based players Alpay Ozalan (Aston Villa), Tugay Kerimoglu and Hakan Sukur (both Blackburn Rovers). A Turkish victory would give the World Cup third-place team a five point advantage at the top of the group and leave England realistically looking at a place in the runners-up playoffs. Beckham knows the Turks are no longer the pushovers who have never beaten or even scored against England in eight meetings, including two 8-0 thrashings at Istanbul (1984) and Wembley ('87). Their last meeting was almost exactly 10 years ago in a World Cup qualification game in Izmir. England won 2-0. ``Football has changed,'' Beckham said. ``But we need not to concede any goals and hopefully score a lot of them.'' As well as needing the victory to keep alive its chances of an automatic berth in the finals, England's stars may be playing for Sven-Goran Eriksson's job. The England coach has been a target for major criticism from the media for England's poor performances since the World Cup. An unconvincing 2-1 win in Slovakia was followed by a 2-2 tie at home to modest Macedonia in another Euro 2004 qualifying game. Then came the embarrassment of a 3-1 loss at home to Australia at West Ham's Upton Park in a friendly in February. Eriksson has been blamed not only for the results but for taking the passion out of England's play. The papers say the Swede's low-key, detached personality appears to have been passed on to the players. ``If you want someone shouting you have to change because that's never been my style,'' Eriksson told reporters on Tuesday. ``At my age it's not easy and I have no intention to change my character. I couldn't do it.'' The papers have also given him plenty of advice on his best lineup and best tactical formation against the Turks. Eriksson has to decide whether to start 17-year-old Everton striker Wayne Rooney for the first time, stick with the Liverpool combination of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey, move Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes forward to partner Owen or leave the Liverpool man on his own in a 4-5-1 formation. Whatever his selection, Eriksson, who has Arsenal centerback Sol Campbell back after an Achilles tendon injury, knows victory is vital. ``All of our players know this is a really big game. We can't fail if we want to win the group,'' he said. Eriksson said he was aware of the criticism aimed at him and the team after the drab performance in Liechtenstein. ``I read some of the papers and it would have been better not to,'' he said. ``We took three points, a professional job done. I know we can play better football of course but let's try to do that tomorrow.'' Eriksson acknowledged that Turkey had made big advances in world soccer. ``You can't compare them with the Turkey of 15 years ago, they are one of the countries making the most progress in the world,'' he said. Turkish coach Senol Gunes, whose team has maintained its World Cup form by winning all three Euro 2004 games so far, compared his team's rise with England's performances in major championships. ``We have improved a lot,'' he said. ``We were quarterfinalists at Euro 2000 and we also came third in the World Cup in 2002. England couldn't qualify for the quarterfinals at Euro 2000 and lost to Brazil in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. ``But this doesn't guarantee that we will win this game. The success we have had in these two competitions does not matter, neither will the record of English teams against Turkey in the past guarantee that they will win. ``Previously we haven't scored against England and we have only one point,'' Gunes said. ``But we always look to the future.'' Police and security staff are expecting a tough night. English and Turkish fans are known for sparking violence and, of the 4,000 tickets sold to the Turkish contingent, some may have gone to Kurdish asylum seekers opposed to the Turkish government. Up to 4,000 police officers will be on duty at the ground and in the city center. Expected lineups: England _ David James, Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Bridge, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Kieron Dyer, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey. Turkey _ Rustu Recber, Fatih Akyel, Alpay Ozalan, Bulent Korkmaz, Emre Belozoglu, Umit Davala, Okan Buruk, Tugay Kerimoglu, Hasan Sas, Nihat Kahveci, Ilhan Mansiz. (rjm)
