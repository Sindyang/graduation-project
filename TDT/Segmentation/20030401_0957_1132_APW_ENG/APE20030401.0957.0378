Nigerian labor groups called off a general strike shortly before it was to begin Tuesday. The Nigerian Labor Congress's announcement on state radio overnight eased some pressure on international oil prices, which have risen during unrelated ethnic violence in the oil-rich Niger Delta since March 12. The fighting has forced multinational firms to cut 800,000 barrels a day, or 40 percent of the 2 million barrels Nigeria produces daily. Congress leaders said they were postponing their work stoppage until after Nigeria's legislative and presidential elections on April 12 and 19. Some civil servants and other workers did not show up on the job Tuesday because they were unaware the strike had been called off, the state radio station reported. The labor grouping, which includes many blue-collar oil workers, is demanding higher salary and other perks. (gam-esh)
