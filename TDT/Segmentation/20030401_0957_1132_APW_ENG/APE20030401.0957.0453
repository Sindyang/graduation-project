One soldier's trash is a Kurdish boy's treasure. A landfill near a U.S.-occupied air strip in Iraq's Kurdish region draws a swarm of local kids rummaging for leftovers from the paratroopers' rations. It's a crash course in American military cuisine. One boy grimaced as he licked some instant coffee mix. They gawked at the miniature bottles of Tabasco hot pepper sauce included in the MREs, or ``meals ready to eat,'' from the airfield near Bashur, where paratroopers from the 173rd U.S. Airborne Brigade arrived last week. The gum and candy are big hits. But the boys can't seem to fathom dishes such as tortellini or beef stroganoff in the vacuum-sealed pouches. ``No, don't!'' cried one of the boys as his friend tried to taste some chewing tobacco. A prize find is peanut butter or grape jelly. The boys have learned they go well on crackers, which apparently get thrown away in abundance by the soldiers. ``I have lots of crackers, but not much to put on them,'' said one boy. Then a trade was struck: one packet of grape jelly for three pre-moistened towelettes. Both boys seemed happy. ^ _ _ _ &lt; What price war? Iraqi Kurds can tell you exactly. Costs for food and many consumer items have skyrocketed in the Western-protected Kurdish enclave since the fighting started. The landlocked region depends on goods coming over the border from neighbors such as Iran and Turkey. Prewar commerce even flowed between Baghdad-controlled Iraq and the Kurds, who are among Saddam Hussein's strongest opponents. Tomatoes used to sell for one dinar (about 14 U.S. cents) for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at the current exchange rate in the Kurdish zone. Now they cost 15 dinars (about US$2). A kilo of oranges has shot from four dinars (56 U.S. cents) to 10 dinars (US$1.40). The price for a kilo of cucumbers has more than doubled to seven dinars (nearly US$1). And the pinch extends from the market to the kitchen. A large canister of cooking propane _ used in many Kurdish kitchens _ has gone from about 25 dinars (about US$3.50) to 90 dinars (close to US$13), which is several days' pay for many Kurds. Gas prices spiked last week at more than four times prewar levels _ reaching above 100 dinars (about US$14) for a 20-liter (about 5 gallons) can sold by curbside peddlers. Prices have fallen a bit since the fighting has been contained mostly to southern Iraq. ``I tell them the prices and they laugh and then they cry,'' said greengrocer Ziad Massoud. ^ _ _ _ &lt; The boom rattled the windows. Was it a U.S. air strike at frontline Iraqi positions? Were the Iraqis shelling the Kurdish town of Kalak just over the river from their outposts? Foreign journalists raced outside into a downpour. ``What was it?'' they asked a Kurdish man. He struggled to explain in English. Then came a loud thunder clap. The man smiled and pointed to the sky. ``No bomb,'' he said. ``Allah boom boom.'' ^ _ _ _ &lt; Internet cafes have already declared victory in the war. The many Internet sites in the Kurdish zone are continually mobbed by journalists filing stories and Kurds keeping up on war developments. Many owners have extended their hours to meet the demand. A popular screensaver image is Saddam Hussein trying to dodge U.S. missiles until finally disappearing after a direct hit. ^ _ _ _ &lt; The world can follow the battlefield on television. Some Kurds can see it live from the safety of their own homes. In the front line town of Kalak, Kurds watch U.S. warplanes strike the Iraqi positions on a ridge less than a kilometer (about half a mile) away. Some families sipped their morning tea as they gathered on roofs with a view: bombs sending up towering columns of deep gray smoke. Shepherds left their sheep to graze as they clambered to hilltops. Children paused their games for a moment after a particularly gut-shaking blast. Then they went back to play. Markets were open. Police directed traffic. The Zab River was like a line separating war's spectacle and its horror. On the western bank, Iraqi soldiers ran for the lives from the relentless onslaught. Across the river in Kalak people just watched.
