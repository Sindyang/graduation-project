The Italian coast guard rescued 207 immigrants including 24 Iraqi refugees in an overloaded wooden boat south of Sicily, officials said Tuesday. Coast guard ships and a helicopter accompanied the 40-foot (12-meter) boat late Monday to the tiny island of Lampedusa, 210 kilometers (130 miles) southwest of Sicily. Twenty-two children were on board, some as young as eight months, port officials said. All the migrants were taken to a holding center on the island, except for a Somali man who was flown to a Palermo hospital to receive treatment for a hernia. The immigrants came from numerous countries, including Sudan, Ghana, Somalia and Iraq. The ANSA news agency said the boat had come from Turkey, and that the migrants had spent five days aboard. Officials would not immediately confirm the report. Thousands of migrants reach Italy every year, with many landing on Lampedusa, a desolate speck of an island closer to Africa than to Italy. (ic/tr)
