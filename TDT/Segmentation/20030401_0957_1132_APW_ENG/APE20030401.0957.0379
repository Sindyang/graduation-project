The winners of this year's French Open will earn more money than last year, but women will still make less than men. Total prize money is going up 6 percent to 13,044,055 million euros (US$14,211,497 at the current exchange rate), the French Tennis Federation said Tuesday. The men's champion will earn 840,000 euros (US$915,180), and the women's champ will earn 819,000 euros (US$892,300). The overall men's increase is 7.7 percent, compared to a 7.6 percent rise for women. The French Open, like Wimbledon, pays more prize money to men. At the other two Grand Slams, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open, the pay is equal. This year is the third consecutive year that prize money has increased at the French Open, which runs May 26-June 8. The purse is up from 12,294,705 euros in 2002. (parf-jg-eg)
