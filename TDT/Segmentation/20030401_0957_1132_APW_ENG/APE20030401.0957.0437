A warplane veered off the USS Constellation's flight deck and into the Persian Gulf after landing early Tuesday. The two pilots ejected into the water and were rescued by helicopter, U.S. military officials said. The S-3B Viking airplane, generally used for anti-submarine warfare, malfunctioned while taxiing on the aircraft carrier's flight deck and slid off the left side into the water, said U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Barry Costello, commander of the Constellation's battle group deployed in the Gulf. Both pilots were rescued and then transported to the Constellation. One collapsed and was taken on a stretcher. The plane sank in 60 meters (200 feet) of water and was considered lost, said Capt. Mark Fox, commander of the Constellation's air wing. No cause was immediately given for the accident. In addition to anti-submarine warfare, S-3B Vikings are used for surveillance and precision targeting and for refueling other planes. _ _ _ On The Net: USS Constellation: http://www.navy.mil/homepages/cv64.
