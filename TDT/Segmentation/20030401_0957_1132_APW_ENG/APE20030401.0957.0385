A judge in Spain's Catalonia region has jailed a man accused of using a machete to stab a waiter who had reprimanded him for smoking a joint in a bar, police said Tuesday. The attack occurred Saturday in the town of Campo in Lleida province. After being scolded, the 42-year-old suspect whose name was not released left the bar, then returned and stabbed the employee four times. The waiter survived the attack, officials said. The suspect is being held on charges of attempted manslaughter. (sc/dw)
