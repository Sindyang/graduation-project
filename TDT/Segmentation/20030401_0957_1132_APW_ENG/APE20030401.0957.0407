Iraqi forces fired artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades at U.S. forces in and around Diwaniyah amid a fierce firefight with U.S. Marines Tuesday, according to field reports. At least 75 Iraqis were killed in fighting on Diwaniyah's outskirts and at least 44 soldiers, including some Republican Guard officers, were taken prisoner, according to Marine Lt. Col. B. P. McCoy. There were no report of American casualties. Northeast of Diwaniyah, there was heavy bombing Tuesday near Kut to clear the way for ground forces, a Marine intelligence analyst said. Marine ground forces also have secured an airbase at Qalat Sukkar, southeast of Kut, that is expected to serve as a staging ground. Around Diwaniyah, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Marines came under fire from artillery and mortars. Hundreds of Iraqi fighters with rocket-propelled grenades and rifles inside the town put up determined resistance during the 8-hour firefight, McCoy said. ``We hammered them pretty hard.'' ``They were shooting from buildings, from dugout positions, from holes from everything. They would jump out to shoot. They were behind buses. You name it they were there,'' said Cpl. Patrick Irish of the Marines' 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment. Marine 155 mm howitzers several kilometers (miles) away fired on Iraqi mortar positions, tanks and bunkers. At least three Iraqis were wounded: Two very thin Iraqi soldiers who had been shot in the legs were being treated with their hands bound behind their backs with silver duct tape; and an older man who had been shot in the back and leg. Overnight, warplanes struck at Iraqi positions around Karbala and Hindiyah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad, in a U.S. effort to open the way for the invasion of Baghdad by American forces massing outside the city. The bombing was in support of the Army's V Corps and hit surface-to-air missile sites and a bridge across the Euphrates River, said Lt. j.g. Nicole Kratzer, a spokeswoman for the air wing of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk. In Baghdad, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said 56 people were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 24 dead in Baghdad. He said nine children, including an infant, were killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately killing people,'' al-Sahhaf said. ``Hillah is my hometown. It is a civilian place.'' ``Iraqis are resisting the mercenaries of the occupation by all means,'' he said, ``through Fedayeen action, martyrdom, ambushes and direct confrontation by all means possible.'' Arab-language satellite television Al Jazeera reported air attacks around the southern city of Basra and showed a white cloud and black smoke rising into the sky, according to live footage. The station said the Tannouma area of Basra was targeted as well as a government building in central Basra. Soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division rested Tuesday, cleaning their weapons, after pitched street battles with Republican Guards and other Iraqi loyalists in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah the day before. Overhead, U.S. troops watched B-52 bombers circle and drop bombs near Karbala and six cruise missiles left contrails in the sky as they flew toward Baghdad and Karbala. ``We need to keep these guys from becoming complacent, thinking they can take anything the Iraqis throw at us,'' said Lt. Col. Philip DeCamp, commander of the 3rd Battalion. He warned that the defenders south of Baghdad will have more powerful weapons, capable of penetrating the armor on U.S. vehicles.
