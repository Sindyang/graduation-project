A high-profile effort by Japan to tighten surveillance of North Korea got off to a shaky start as Japanese officials contradicted each other and their allies over reports Tuesday that the communist nation had test-fired a missile. The confusion came just days after Japan put its first spy satellites into orbit as part of a billion-dollar program aimed at monitoring moves by North Korea to develop missiles or nuclear weapons. North Korea denounced the satellite launch as a hostile act and hinted it might test-fire a missile in response. That scenario appeared to play out early Tuesday, when Japanese military and government officials announced that North Korea had launched a shore-to-ship missile from its west coast into the Yellow Sea. The U.S. Defense Department confirmed the report, and officials in both countries described the missile as a short-range weapon that was not considered a threat. But South Korea said it had no evidence of a launch, and hours later officials in Tokyo weren't so sure themselves. A senior Defense Agency official issued a retraction Tuesday evening, telling reporters the government was ``still trying to confirm'' reports that a missile had been fired. 'We are still trying to confirm information including whether or not a launch took place,'' said the official, Shoei Yamanaka. ``It is regrettable I must start by issuing this correction.'' Japanese officials were tightlipped about the source of their information. But the chief government spokesman did say the reports indicated North Korea had issued a keep-clear warning to maritime traffic similar to those that preceded previous test launches of anti-ship missiles. A military analyst said the information probably came from U.S. officials, since Japan's two new spy satellites were not expected to be fully operational for three months. But he added that the unexplained retraction reflected weaknesses in the nation's intelligence community that might not be rectified by its new eyes in the sky. ``This just proves that Japan's ability to verify data isn't reliable,'' said Tetsuya Ozeki, director of the private ATWI research institute. ``Someone in the Defense Agency may have jumped to the wrong conclusion based on a piece of unconfirmed information from Washington.'' In any case, Tuesday's embarrassing about-face was not the image Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government wanted to project to a nation worried about the threat posed by increasing sophisticated missiles under development by North Korea. That threat was illustrated in dramatic fashion in 1998, when North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile that flew over Japan's main island before crashing into the ocean. The so-called ``Taepodong shock'' showed that virtually all of Japan was within range of North Korean missiles and jolted a country used to relying on the United States for the bulk of its intelligence. The government's response was a 250 billion yen (US$2 billion) surveillance program that calls for putting at least four spy satellites into orbit. The first two were launched Friday from Japan's space center on the southern island of Tanegashima and are expected to be in use for about five years. North Korea has warned that the program might spark an arms race in Asia, language that has raised concerns the communist nation might carry out a tit-for-tat test launch of one of its missiles. Early Tuesday a Japanese Cabinet minister and a senior military official said it had done just that. Transport Minister Chigake Ogi told lawmakers Tuesday morning that North Korea had fired a missile into the Yellow Sea from a site along its western coast at about 10:15 a.m. local time. A similar announcement was made later by Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of Japan's navy. But the government appeared to waver Tuesday afternoon after South Korea dismissed the report. An official at the Defense Ministry in Seoul said South Korean and U.S. intelligence officials had concluded there was no missile launch. Japanese officials including Yamanaka and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda later distanced themselves from the earlier remarks by their colleagues, saying the launch reports had not been confirmed. It was unclear late Tuesday when the government would make a follow-up announcement. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March as the crisis over its suspected nuclear weapons program deepened. That crisis started late last year, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted secretly developing weapons in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies responded by suspending fuel shipments, and Pyongyang retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.
