Widespread abuse by police in Romania's overcrowded prisons resulted in three deaths from 2001-2002, according to a U.S. State Department report released Tuesday by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. In the report, the State Department concluded that Romania's human rights record has been improving in recent years as the former communist country moves toward a market economy and democracy. But there was still room for improvement, it added. ``The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas,'' the report said. ``Police use of excessive force resulted in three deaths.'' In March 2002, a prisoner identified as Mihai Iorga died after police officers beat him over the head with a hammer. He lapsed into a coma, but received no medical treatment. In another case, police beat to death an 18-year-old Roma, or Gypsy, man in a prison in the town of Jilava, just south of Bucharest. The two police officers who had carried out the beatings were subsequently demoted. While in some cases police officers suspected of abuse lost their jobs or faced criminal charges, all too often the system failed to punish those responsible for abuses, the report said. ``Investigations of police abuses generally were lengthy and inconclusive and rarely resulted in prosecution or punishment,'' the report said. The interior and justice ministries refused comment, saying they had not yet received the report. The report said that while some progress had resulted from efforts to reform the police system, ``at times authorities violated the prohibition against arbitrary arrest and detention.'' ``Prison conditions remained harsh and overcrowding remained a serious problem,'' the report also said.
