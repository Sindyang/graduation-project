NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. defense officials in Washington said Tuesday it is asking Fox News Channel to remove a reporter from a posting with U.S. troops in Iraq where he was accused of disclosing unauthorized information. The network agreed to remove former talk show host Geraldo Rivera, Lt. Col. Dave Lapan said. ``We have asked that he be removed and we are working with them to make that happen,'' he said. Fox News Channel executives did not immediately return calls seeking comment Tuesday. Earlier, Rivera had dismissed reports that he had been ejected from Iraq for revealing tactical information about the 101st Airborne Division. Also Tuesday, a British tabloid said it has hired Peter Arnett, who was dismissed by NBC television Monday for giving an unauthorized interview to Iraqi state television in which he said the American-led war effort initially failed because of Iraq's resistance. ``Fired by America for telling the truth,'' the Daily Mirror said in a Page 1 headline. Lapan said Rivera reported details of troop operations by drawing a line in the sand showing where his unit was and where it was going next. Reporters who are ``embedded'' with U.S. troops are not supposed to disclose details that could help Iraqis figure out their location and plans. Rivera, Lapan said, was put with his unit as a ``short-term embed,'' meaning the military agreed he could go for a couple of days. Fox's rivals, CNN and MSNBC television, both reported Monday that Rivera had been kicked out of the country. Shortly thereafter, Rivera delivered a report via satellite phone saying he was 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Baghdad. Rivera labeled reports of his ouster ``a pack of lies.'' Arnett apologized Monday for his ``misjudgment'' in talking to Iraqi TV. But he added: ``I said over the weekend what we all know about this war.'' Arnett, who won a Pulitzer Prize reporting in Vietnam for The Associated Press, gained much of his prominence from covering the 1991 Gulf War for CNN. NBC was angered because Arnett gave the interview Sunday without permission and presented opinion as fact. The network initially backed him, but reversed field after watching a tape of his appearance. The network said it got ``thousands'' of e-mails and phone calls protesting Arnett's remarks. In the interview, shown by Iraq's satellite television, Arnett said the United States was reappraising the battlefield and delaying the war, maybe for a week, ``and rewriting the war plan. The first war plan has failed because of Iraqi resistance. Now they are trying to write another war plan.'' Arnett said it was clear that, within the United States, opposition to the war was growing, along with a challenge to U.S. President George W. Bush about the war's conduct. The London newspaper that hired him, the Mirror, is vehemently opposed to the war. ``I am still in shock and awe at being fired,'' Arnett wrote for the newspaper.
