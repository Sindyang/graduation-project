Sri Lanka's chief cricket selector Guy de Alwis resigned Tuesday, alleging the country's sports minister was interfering in the team selection process. ``From the time we took over, it has been a battle (with the minister) after every tournament,'' Alwis, a former test wicketkeeper, told The Associated Press. Sports Minister Johnston Fernando last week refused to ratify a squad for the upcoming Sharjah Cup tournament, beginning in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, selected by the two-member selection panel which de Alwis heads. International teams require ministerial approval in Sri Lanka. The squad excluded middle-order batsmen Russel Arnold, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara, medium fast bowler Pulasthi Gunaratne and ace offspinner Muttiah Muralitharan. Fernando later appointed three more members to the selection committee who brought back Muralitharan and Sangakkara and left out all-rounders Hasantha Fernando and Thilan Samaraweera. ``We had already selected a squad and later had to keep away two boys. It's very wrong,'' de Alwis said, adding the decision would likely have shattered the hopes of youngsters Fernando and Samaraweera. He said while many teams around the world were tying to bring younger players into international teams, the minister wanted to continue with the older players. The sports minister was unavailable for comment Tuesday. However, a new member of the selection committee Aravinda de Silva said Monday that its policy was to combine youth and experience. The Sharjah Cup tournament, involving Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Kenya, is scheduled to begin Thursday. De Alwis said he will continue to work as a member of the cricket board's interim committee.
