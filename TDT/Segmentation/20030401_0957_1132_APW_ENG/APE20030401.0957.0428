The Soviet-made AN-24 biplane took off from Jose Marti International Airport about 10:45 a.m. (15:45 GMT) for an unknown destination, apparently with the hijacker still aboard.

Shortly before the plane took off, two white cars drove onto the tarmac and a man aboard one handed three large plastic bags filled with unknown contents to someone inside the plane. MORE
