A former senior government official being tried on charges that he plotted to kill a prominent Czech journalist will remain behind bars indefinitely, the suspect's lawyer said Tuesday. The judge hearing the case against Karel Srba, a former Foreign Ministry general secretary arrested last July, has refused to grant Srba provisional release on 3 million koruna (US$100,000) bail or on assurances that he poses no flight risk, defense attorney Miroslav Krizenecky said. ``He certainly is accused of a serious criminal activity, but it's still difficult for me to understand,'' said Krizenecky, a former prosecutor who was the Czech Communist Party's candidate for president in January elections. Srba and three other suspects are charged with plotting the slaying of Sabina Slonkova, an investigative reporter with the influential newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Slonkova had written a series of articles describing a deal in which the Foreign Ministry leased a building in Moscow, owned by the Czech government, to a private company under suspicious circumstances. The newspaper also published a list of properties owned by Srba which significantly surpassed his official income, prompting financial authorities to launch an investigation. Srba ran the finances at the ministry under former Finance Minister Jan Kavan, signing countless investment contracts before he was fired in 2001 amid allegations of corruption. In August, he was formally charged with corruption. Srba pleaded innocent at his trial, which opened last month at a regional court in Ceske Budejovice, 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Prague before adjourning until April 16. Prosecutors say a police raid on Srba's home uncovered photographs of the targeted journalist, documents containing details of her life and about 30 million koruna (US$1 million) in cash. (kj/nr/bk)
