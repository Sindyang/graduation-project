Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect in the assassination of Serbia's prime minister. Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the leader of an underworld Belgrade clan, also is linked to other politically motivated killings during Milosevic's autocratic rule, investigators said in a statement. Lukovic and his gang ``killed political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic passport and a fake Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name. The discovery ``will speed up the arrest of that criminal,'' they said. Lukovic has been on the run since the March 12 sniper assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in downtown Belgrade. Also Tuesday, two close Milosevic aides _ his former army chief, Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, and former customs chief Mihalj Kertes _ were detained for questioning, according to police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Kertes was considered a key figure in the secret financing of Serb rebels and paramilitaries fighting in Bosnia and Croatia, while Pavkovic commanded Milosevic's army units in Kosovo during the 1998-99 conflict there. A special police unit under Lukovic's command until 2001 is suspected of having carried out Djindjic's killing and of slaying former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in August 2000. Tuesday's police statement came a day after authorities sought an international arrest warrant for Markovic, alleging she was involved in Stambolic's killing. She denounced the warrant in a message from Russia as a political ploy. The investigation of Djindjic's killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy led by war criminals and war profiteers ... all from the ranks of Milosevic's regime,'' the police statement said. As president, Milosevic allowed underworld figures to fight alongside notorious paramilitary units in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, he gave them a free hand to join regular police forces, authorities allege. Those ties continued even after the pro-democracy leadership took over in 2000. Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Later, Djindjic spearheaded efforts to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. Markovic wielded considerable influence over Milosevic and his leftist Socialist Party. Stambolic, Serbia's president for a year in the late 1980s, was preparing to challenge Milosevic in national elections when he disappeared in August, 2000, just two months before Milosevic was ousted. Serbian police last week discovered Stambolic's body during a crackdown on the paramilitary and underworld network accused of Djindjic's assassination. Markovic reportedly left for Russia in late February to join her son, Marko Milosevic, who fled Serbia following Milosevic's ouster.
