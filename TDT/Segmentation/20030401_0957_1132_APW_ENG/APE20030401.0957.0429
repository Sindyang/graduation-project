The Toronto Stock Exchange halted trading Tuesday in Air Canada shares ahead of an announcement by the nation's dominant airline expected to involve seeking protection from creditors. An Air Canada spokesman confirmed the halt in share trading and said an announcement was upcoming, but refused to divulge further details. The airline's stock hit a new 52-week low on Monday, closing at C$2.11 (US$1.45) a share, down 15 percent on the day. Air Canada ended 2002 with a C$428-million (US$295 million) loss, bringing the total to more than C$1.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) since its last profitable year in 1999. The company also has C$12.9 billion (US$8.8 billion) in long-term debt and leases, which would likely be renegotiated if Air Canada goes through a court-monitored financial restructuring. Media reports speculate Air Canada will seek bankruptcy protection to restructure its business and get assistance from the Canadian government, perhaps in loan guarantees. The airline has been hurt by the global slump in air travel after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, as well as reduced traffic amid the current war in Iraq and the outbreak in Toronto of a mystery flu-like illness from Asia. On Monday, two of Air Canada's biggest unions accepted major layoffs as part of restructuring the airline said it needs to survive. The Canadian Auto Workers and the union representing machinists and baggage handlers said they will lose more than 2,300 jobs as their share of 3,600 job cuts announced March 20. The autoworkers union, which represents ticket agents and other workers, said it will lift a no-layoff clause for 1,060 employees and has agreed to defer a 2.5 percent salary increase that was supposed to come into effect Tuesday. The union are expected to save Air Canada up to C$40 million (US$27.5 million) a year. Buzz Hargrove, president of the autoworkers union, said it recognizes a crisis exists and that everyone _ including the government _ must help keep the airline flying. ``It is not a permanent fix,'' Hargrove said after meeting with Transport Minister David Collenette. ``It is an interim measure that will allow reductions in the work force to take place immediately. We see absolutely no alternative.'' Collenette said Monday the federal government is considering ways to help the airline, but has ruled out a cash bailout. The Toronto Star reported Monday the government was preparing a financial package for Air Canada, conditional on the airline seeking protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Under the act, Air Canada would get court-protection from its creditors _ allowing it to continue operating while working out a plan acceptable to its various stakeholders, including lenders, suppliers and employees. The airline also said Monday it will reduce its flights between Hong Kong and Canada to nine per week, down from 14 per week now, because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Asia and Canada. Smaller reductions also will be made in flights to Beijing and Shanghai, said Air Canada spokeswoman Laura Cooke. Air Canada is by far the country's largest airline and the only scheduled Canadian carrier with an extensive route network to the United States and other foreign destinations.
