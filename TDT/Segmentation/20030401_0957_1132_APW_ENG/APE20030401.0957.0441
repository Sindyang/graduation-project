In statements aimed at smoothing relations with the United States, French leaders on Thursday warned against anti-Americanism and said they were on the ``side of the democracies'' in the war in Iraq. The comments to lawmakers by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin reflected the unease in Paris that the French stand against the war could damage ties with Washington. ``It is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable,'' spokesman Jean-Francois Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament at a meeting Tuesday at the prime minister's office. Villepin, who last week refused to answer a reporter's question about whom he wanted to win the war, declared on Tuesday in Parliament that France was firmly behind its allies. The foreign minister called Saddam Hussein the leader of a ``cruel and dictatorial regime,'' and said it was France's responsibility to back the side of law and peace. ``In the war, this responsibility naturally leads France to stand at the side of its allies, on the side of the democracies,'' he said, apparently referring to the United States and Britain. Villepin's office last week issued a terse statement declaring his hope for the victory of the U.S.-led forces in the war after media reports suggested that the French diplomat's stand was ambiguous. Raffarin and other French officials have made similar statements this week. On Monday, the prime minister said France's opposition to the war did not mean it considered the United States an enemy. Though the government is insisting it wants to see the U.S. coalition win, the public appears to be much more ambivalent. A poll by Le Monde newspaper and TF1 television station published on Monday said that only 34 percent of respondents considered themselves ``on the side'' of the U.S.-led forces, while 25 percent said they supported Iraq. The telephone poll of 948 people conducted March 28 and 29 said that 31 percent supported neither side. The survey did not provide a margin of error, but polls of that size usually have margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The French government has been on the defensive recently, clearly concerned that its strident anti-war stance is being seen by many on the other side of the Atlantic as a betrayal of Washington. ``France does not turn on its friends,'' declared Christian Poncelet, the president of the French Senate. ``They have taken a position that is not ours, but that in no way dents our good relations.'' Lawmaker Jacques Barrot, who leads President Jacques Chirac's Union for a Popular Movement in the National Assembly, said Paris' opposition to the war should not be read as support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. ``We should not mistake who the enemy is,'' Barrot said. ``We cannot allow the glorification of Saddam Hussein.'' Portraits of the Iraqi leader are held aloft at anti-war marches in France, along with Iraqi flags. The government is also worried about the frequent protests against the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. Raffarin also warned on Tuesday that signs of racism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia should not be tolerated. Angry demonstrators attacked two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights group posted monitors along a subsequent anti-war march route to guard against displays of anti-Semitism.
