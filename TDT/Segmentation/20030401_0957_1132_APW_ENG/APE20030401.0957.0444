The German government has decided against taking part in a new NATO naval deployment in the western Mediterranean meant as a precaution against terrorist attacks, Defense Minister Peter Struck said Tuesday. Struck told reporters that offers from ``enough other NATO states'' to provide six speedboats for the mission made German participation unnecessary. He did not elaborate. Germany strongly opposes the U.S.-led war in Iraq and has refused to contribute troops there, but the government insisted that the Mediterranean mission was separate. A German frigate is already participating in NATO's Active Endeavor operation to patrol the eastern Mediterranean, set up following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The alliance finalized plans a month ago to extend the naval patrols to the whole Mediterranean Sea up to the Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Morocco. Norway already has said it was asked to supply torpedo boats for the patrols. Despite its opposition to the Iraq war, Germany has a unit trained in detect biological and chemical agents stationed in Kuwait as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the U.S.-led anti-terror campaign launched after the Sept. 11 attacks. German frigates are also patrolling shipping lanes off the Horn of Africa. Close to Iraq, German crew members are taking part in flights by NATO surveillance planes over Turkey to guard against a possible Iraqi attack. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder says the AWACS flights _ politically controversial in Germany _ are covered by Berlin's obligation to defend a NATO ally and would not be used to support the war. An opposition party has unsuccessfully asked Germany's supreme court to order a parliamentary vote on the AWACS deployment _ something that would test the slim majority of Schroeder's center-left coalition. ^ (gm-tc) &lt;
