Henry Racamier, who took charge of family-owned leather company Louis Vuitton at age 65 and transformed it into a luxury goods giant, has died. He was 90. Racamier died on Saturday of a heart attack while traveling in Sardinia, according to a statement by the National Opera of Paris, which Racamier backed for years. Racamier, born in 1912 in Pont-de-Roide, France, had already made his fortune as founder and director of a stainless steel company when he took over at Louis Vuitton in 1977. The businessman's wife, Odile Vuitton, was a descendant of Louis Vuitton. The family-run business, founded in 1854, had only two exclusive shops in France when Racamier took over. Over the next 13 years, Racamier modernized factories and made acquisitions that turned the company into one of the globe's leading luxury goods groups, with 140 shops worldwide. In 1987, he merged his company with French spirits, champagne and perfume group Moet Hennessy. Racamier, however, was forced out of the group in 1990 over heated disagreements over company control and other issues with financier Bernard Arnault. Racamier was well-known as a patron of the arts. In 1986, he founded the Louis Vuitton Foundation for the Opera, Music and the Arts. From 1995 to 1999, he served as president of an association that raises funds for the National Opera of Paris. Racamier is survived by his wife and two twin daughters, Caroline Bentz and Laurence Fontaine. (jc-jg)
