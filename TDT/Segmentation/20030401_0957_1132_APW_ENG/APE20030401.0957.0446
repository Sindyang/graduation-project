Ukraine has lifted its 15-month-old ban on imports of U.S. poultry, the country's top veterinary official said Tuesday. Petro Verbytskyi, head of the Veterinary Department in the Agriculture Ministry, announced the decision after returning from Washington where an agreement to clear the way for imports was signed. During their four-day visit, Ukrainian veterinary officials certified that U.S. chicken could be imported ``if no antibiotics or chemicals were used,'' Verbytskyi said. In this case, ``no barriers exist to import poultry from the United States,'' he added. Prior to the ban's imposition in January 2002, U.S. producers supplied some 90 percent of all chicken imports to Ukraine. Ukraine imposed the ban because the American poultry industry widely uses antibiotics and chemicals to stimulate chicken growth, as well as preservatives and disinfecting substances to keep meat fresh. Such chemicals are banned in Ukraine, although U.S. officials insist such chicken is safe to eat. Verbytskyi said Ukraine's legislation banning chemical additives and growth stimulants is a holdover from Soviet times that is ripe for change. Ukraine imported 69,000 metric tons (76,060 tons) of chicken in 2001. (am/tv/jh)
