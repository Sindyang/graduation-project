As the trickle of governing Popular Party anti-war resignations continued Tuesday, Spanish opposition parties presented another motion in Parliament condemning the attacks while tens of thousands of students staged more protests across the country. The resignation of councilor Edith Bedin Oviedo from the small central town of Damiel was the 14th so far in the party in protest over the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the Spanish ruling party's support for it. So far no parliamentary deputy has resigned, although more than one has begun to voice opposition to the war which started March 20. Until recently, support for Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar within his party had seemed airtight. Aznar is one of the firmest advocates of the U.S.-led drive to oust Saddam Hussein although the vast majority of Spaniards are opposed to the war. ``What's strange is not that there should be discrepancies within the PP over its involvement in the war but rather that they should take so long in coming out,'' the leading daily El Pais said in an editorial. But Popular Party parliamentary spokesman Luis de Grandes said the dissension showed that the party was pluralist. Other party leaders put the resignations down to the fact that the outgoing deputies were not included in upcoming municipal election lists. Also Tuesday, tens of thousands of university students took to streets again in at least 10 cities to protest the war and demand Aznar's resignation. In Parliament, the leading opposition Socialist party was to put to vote a motion calling on Aznar to change tack and launch a call to stop the war. ``One step backward (for Aznar) would be one step forward for peace,'' party Parliamentary spokesman Jesus Caldera told reporters. The motion is expected to be backed by the opposition parties and rejected by the majority-ruling 183 Popular Party members. (cg/dw-jg)
