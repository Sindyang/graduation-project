Balinese Hindus ushered in their holiest day by torching a giant effigy of a key suspect in last year's deadly terrorist bombings _ along with dozens of other ``demons'' _ as part of a ceremony to banish evil from the island. Amrozi, who will soon go on trial for his alleged role in the attack that killed 202 people, was depicted carrying several sticks of dynamite attached to a timer. He was dressed in prison uniform. ``He was under the influence of an evil spirit,'' said Ida Bagus, one of several people who spent months constructing the stunningly realistic seven-meter-high (seven-yard-high) model from bamboo and papier mache. The evil spirit ``Butakala'' is depicted standing on the shoulders of Amrozi, who like many Indonesians goes by a single name. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of people paraded through the crowded streets of Denpasar with hundreds of models known as ``ogok ogok'', some with contemporary figures like Amrozi and others representing traditional demons and monsters from Balinese mythology. The effigies then were burned in ceremonies meant to drive evil sprits from the island. Priests also make sacrifices and lead prayers at town squares and temples. Many burned the models in cemeteries and Amrozi's likeness went up in flames in the nearby village of Sanur to the cheers from a frenzied crowd. Bali is overwhelmingly Hindu, unlike the rest of Muslim-dominated Indonesia. On Wednesday, the island celebrates Nyepi, or Day of Silence, when most Balinese refrain from going out, making noise or using electricity, and spend the day mediating or praying. Tourists visiting the island are asked not to leave their hotels and the airport is closed until Thursday morning. International flights passing over Bali are rerouted for the day. Nyepi is a national holiday throughout Indonesia, which has a secular government and significant Christian and Buddhist minorities. The Oct. 12 bombings hit Bali's thriving tourist industry hard. Thousands of hotel workers have been laid off and most restaurants and souvenir shops are struggling to stay afloat. Tourist arrivals have picked up slightly over the past months, but are still way down on what they were before the attack. Amrozi was the first of 29 suspects arrested over the bombings, the worst terror attacks since the Sept. 11 strikes on the United States. Most of the victims were Western tourists. Police say Amrozi bought the minivan used in the attack and delivered the explosives. He has told reporters he carried out the attack to avenge the oppression of Muslims around the world.
