Using ships, divers and even dolphins, Australian, British and American forces rushed to clear mines from the waters in southern Iraq and clear a path for humanitarian aid. The first boatload of supplies arrived last week at the strategic southern port of Umm Qasr, but a naval officer admitted Monday that navigating the surrounding waterways was still too dangerous to allow regular aid convoys. ``There's still a lot of work to do,'' said British Royal Navy Cmdr. Brian Mair, one of the officers heading up mine-clearing efforts. ``If you don't want mistakes and accidents to happen, you have to be slow and methodical.'' Clearing a safe path to Umm Qasr is key to securing southern Iraq and creating a foothold for the rest of country. It is Iraq's only deep-water port, and coalition forces hope to make it the center for distributing humanitarian relief. In prewar days, Umm Qasr was the main entry point for supplies bought through the U.N.-administered oil-for-food program. Annually an estimated 3 million tons of grain, 1 million tons of dry foods, and 750,000 containers came through the port. War has disrupted that flow, and aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis in Iraq, where a dozen years of economic sanctions have left some 60 percent of its 27 million people dependent on government rations. Before the shipments to Umm Qasr can resume, however, the treacherous channel leading to port must be completely swept of boat-sinking mines. British, American and Australian clearing teams have already been at it for more than a week. So far, they have largely cleared a 365-meter-wide path along the 65-kilometer-long (40-mile) channel from the Persian Gulf to Umm Qasr. The British supply ship RFA Sir Galahad docked there last Friday and unloaded the first military shipment of relief aid: 100 tons of water and 150 tons of rice, lentils, cooking oil, tomato paste, chick peas, sugar, powdered milk, and tea. But Mair said it would be ``some time'' before the port can be considered safe, stressing that it is probably impossible to ensure that all mines have been cleared. The coalition's aim is to achieve a clearance rate above 90 percent, he said. Mair wouldn't speculate about how many mines might be out there, saying only that coalition forces have destroyed ``quite a lot'' of them since clearing efforts started shortly after Iraqi forces were pushed from Umm Qasr. Mair helps oversee a variety of mine-clearing tactics from the USS Ponce, an amphibious support ship in the Persian Gulf. The first line of defense are the mine clearing ships _ six of them British, four American _ that blanket the seas with powerful sonar searching for unusual objects, what the mine hunters call ``contacts.'' Many mines use magnetic triggers, so the ships are made from nonmagnetic materials, like plastic, fiberglass and phosphor bronze. To cut down on the threat of mines set off by sounds or vibrations, the ships are designed to be extremely quiet. Once a contact is made, human divers or remote-controlled vehicles are sent down to check it out. If it appears to be a mine or unexploded ordnance _ which can also pose a threat to ships _ divers place an explosive on it and blow it up. Helicopters can also hunt for mines by dragging a ``sled'' through the water behind them. The sleds create a magnetic field and produce sounds and vibrations similar to those of a ship. The idea is to trigger mines planted on the seabed. And of course, there are the mine-hunting dolphins _ a total of nine in the region _ specially trained to use their natural sonar to root out the deadly underwater bombs. So far, the dolphins are getting rave reviews. ``The Lord God decided to give them the best sonar ever devised,'' Mair said. ``We can only aspire to their ability.''
