The German government advised Tuesday against trips to parts of the Sahara Desert in Algeria after a fourth group of tourists went missing in the region. The six tourists from Bavaria who were traveling by car in southern Algeria were reported missing at the weekend, bringing the total number of missing Europeans to 17. In an update on its Web site, the Foreign Ministry said travelers should avoid ``at all costs'' the area around Tamanrasset, where the group was last seen, as well as a route between the towns of Illizi and Hadjadj. ``Criminal bands and smugglers present an increased security risk,'' near Algeria's porous borders with Niger and Mali, it said, urging travelers to use experienced travel firms if they decide to go ahead. A ministry spokesman said Algerian authorities also have found no trace of three groups who disappeared in the Algerian Sahara in February. Helicopters and four-wheel-drive vehicles were used to search for six Germans, one Dutch citizen and four Swiss travelers. The spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anomymity, said a German police liaison officer had arrived in Algeria Monday to boost efforts by the German Embassy in Algiers to find the missing tourists. Swiss authorities say their citizens last called relatives from Illizi on Feb. 20. (swg-gm)
