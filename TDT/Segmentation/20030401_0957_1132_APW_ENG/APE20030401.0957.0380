FRANKFURT, Germany _ The slump at Germany's big banks is dragging down another of the country's financial heavyweights _ reinsurer Munich Re, whose large stakes in its fellow financial institutions have magnified the impact of falling stock markets on the company. The reason isn't so much in Munich Re's basic business of selling backup coverage to insurance companies, which analysts say is turning around. Much of the headache comes from the German tradition in which the country's big businesses own large chunks of each other. Munich Re, which is the world's largest reinsurer, has seen its shares slide rapidly since it announced last week that 5.7 billion euros (US$6.2 billion) in losses on stakes in other companies had sapped its earnings. That started a spiral of bad news, as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors lowered Munich Re's financial-strength rating and investors sold off the stock. It traded at around 55 euros (US$59) Tuesday _ down more than 30 percent from just under 82 euros before last week's announcement, and down 86 percent from its peak of 387 euros in 2001. Munich Re owns 25 percent in struggling HVB bank, which lost 858 million euros (US$927 million) last year, and 20 percent in primary insurer Allianz, which lost 1.2 billion euros (US$1.4 billion) and owns Dresdner Bank. Dresdner Bank reported a 1.4 billion euro (US$1.6 billion) loss for 2002. In addition, Munich Re owns 10.4 percent of lossmaking Commerzbank, the country's fourth largest. All invest heavily in stocks and have been victims of the current bear market on their own terms. But the crossed shareholdings makes trouble contagious, since when one stock falls, the other companies' shares _ and subsequently their earnings _ suffer along with it. ``The connection between Allianz, HVB and Munich is particularly bad,'' said analyst Ralf Dibbern at M.M. Warburg in Hamburg. ``Every time one goes down, the others follow, that's the problem.'' The bank's troubles and falling stock markets have proved bigger financial trouble for Munich Re than the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, which cost it 2.6 billion euros in damage claims spread over two years _ but only dented the stock price briefly. Munich Re says it will seek to replenish its finances with a bond issue, the size of which is still being decided as the company tests institutional investors' appetite this week with presentations in Paris, Amsterdam, London and Frankfurt. But some investors fear Munich Re may be forced to do what Allianz did last week _ announce it would increase its capital by issuing new shares. Shareholders hate that because it dilutes the value of their holdings. The company says it won't. ``There is no question of a capital increase,'' said spokesman Florian Woest. Ironically, the crash in the company's stock price comes as some think its basic business is turning around. After the huge losses of Sept. 11, Munich Re and other reinsurers took steps to lessen their dependence on stock market gains by raising prices and capping coverage. ``I am positive on their underwriting business,'' said Warburg analyst Dibbern. Munich Re had net profit of 1.1 billion euros (US$1.3 billion) but would have shown a loss without one-time gains from 4.7 billion from selling part of its stake in Allianz and its subsidiaries. Reinsurers have in essence two businesses: collecting premiums and paying claims, and the potentially more lucrative _ but unpredictable _ investment of premium proceeds on stock markets. Further sudden drops in the stock market could mean trouble, Dibbern said: ``That's another matter _ if equity markets fall another 20 percent, then the situation is different.'' In addition, Munich Re and Allianz plan to cut their stakes in each other to 15 percent _ below the 20 percent threshold where they must show their share of the other's losses in their earnings, and lessening some of the vicious circle's effect.
