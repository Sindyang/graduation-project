Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov scolded top officials about the state of the country's decrepit armed forces, telling them to better train soldiers. ``You can't cram soldiers' heads full of studies and lectures. Soldiers should practice,'' Niyazov told Defense Minister Redzhepbai Arzov and border service chief Agadzhan Mametgeldyev during a Monday Cabinet meeting. ``Right now we have 600 tanks, 100 of them in non-working condition. Give the soldiers a screwdriver and let them figure out how to fix the motor,'' he said. He said soldiers should also be put to work on construction projects and farms, to teach them useful skills. Turkmenistan's military has fallen into disarray since the collapse of the Soviet Union and is one of the weakest in Central Asia. Niyazov, who has ruled the country since 1985 when it was still a Soviet republic, maintains a tight grip on power and has fostered a vast cult of personality around himself. The country's remains mired in poverty despite its vast energy riches. (ga/ee)
