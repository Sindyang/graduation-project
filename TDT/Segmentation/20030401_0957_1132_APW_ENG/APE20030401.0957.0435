A day after Syria came out firmly behind Iraq, a German newspaper printed an interview Tuesday quoting Syrian President Bashar Assad as saying differences with the United States were nothing new and that perhaps the two countries one day would again find common ground. While maintaining Syria's opposition to the Iraq war, Assad did not echo comments by the Syrian Foreign Ministry Monday calling the U.S. invasion illegitimate and unjustified _ and he pointed out his country's backing of the U.S.-led war against terrorism launched after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. ``The relationship between Syria and the United States has long been full of contradictions, the latest is just the most recent facet. We agree with the United States on the topic of terrorism, but we disagree completely on the Iraq war,'' Assad was quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung as saying. ``Perhaps one day there will be again a topic that we agree on, and then the relationship will look good again.'' Tensions between the United States and Syria have escalated this week, with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accusing Syria of supplying Iraq with military equipment. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Syria to cease its support for terrorism, suggesting it would otherwise face grave consequences. ``Syria now faces a critical choice'' of whether to ``continue its direct support for terrorism in the dying days'' of President Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq, Powell said in a strongly worded speech Sunday to a pro-Israeli lobby. Assad blamed an aggressive U.S. posture for current rifts, suggesting Washington was squandering its stature as a superpower. ``Perhaps the United States, as a great power, is used to foisting its opinions on others. But every country has its own opinions and interests.'' He said the United States has failed to present evidence proving Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction or tying Iraq to terrorism. The one bright spot in the current crisis, he said, was anti-war demonstrations in Europe and the Middle East, which made it more difficult for extremists to see the current conflict as a clash of civilizations. ``That is the only positive point. It is an historic opportunity that we must grab. You have no idea the impact of the demonstrations in Europe and the Middle East,'' Assad said. The Syrian president refused to comment on whether he believed the United States might target other countries, including Syria, after Iraq, saying the suggestion has been made by people he described as ``extreme.'' ``But the problem is that the reality is not very comforting _ that the only world power has lost contact with the world. The greatest military superpower is not helping he world, rather it is beginning a war. If a small country makes a mistake, the neighbors suffer. But when a world power makes a mistake the whole world suffers.'' (cb-gm)
