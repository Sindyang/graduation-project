The U.N. health agency said Tuesday it is considering whether to advise travelers against going to Hong Kong and other Asian countries hit by a mysterious and deadly disease. The rare move follows information from Hong Kong authorities that they have been unable to find a link between new cases there and patients previously infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which has so far killed at least 63 people and sickened more than 1,600. ``It appears that there is now some environmental factor, such as water or sewage, which is taking this disease from one human to another,'' said Dr. David Heymann, infectious diseases chief at the World Health Organization. He said the concerns center around an apartment block in Hong Kong where a large number of cases have been reported. Some patients do not remember being in contact with any other patient, leading doctors to wonder if the disease is being spread through the building without close human contact. WHO still insists that the disease is not airborne but says it can be passed through small droplets of breath or by touching something recently touched by a patient. Heymann said the WHO is hopeful that authorities will link all the cases by early Wednesday. If not, it will decide whether to advise against travel. Until now, WHO has issued advice only to governments, with the aim of preventing the spread of the disease. It hasn't advised against travel, but has said airports should screen passengers and refuse to board those who have symptoms or who have been in contact with SARS patients. Now it is considering updating its advice to travelers to take account of SARS. Until now, that list mostly consists of advice on whether travelers need vaccinations or antimalarial tablets. But there is no vaccination available against SARS ``so the advice might be to avoid the area altogether,'' Heymann said. With cases already found in a number of European countries from air passengers who have been in the affected regions, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among European countries already have advised residents against traveling there unless their trip is absolutely essential. ^ (nk-agh) &lt;
