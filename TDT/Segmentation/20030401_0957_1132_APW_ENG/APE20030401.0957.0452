The federal government on Tuesday ordered all airports in India to screen passengers coming from countries hit by a deadly mystery disease, a news report said. Airline officials have been directed to keep a lookout for passengers who display symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the Press Trust of India news agency said. Scientists have yet to identify the disease that has killed at least 63 people, mostly in Asia, and sickened more than 1,600 globally. Airline staff have been told to inform authorities if they find people with symptoms associated with the illness, such as a dry cough and fever, and airport doctors have been ordered to be on duty round the clock, Press Trust of India said. ``Authorities have been asked to keep a close watch on passengers coming from 15 countries where the risk of the disease is high,'' PTI quoted civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain as saying. He did not list the countries. China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam have been among the hardest hit countries. Officials were not immediately available to comment on the report. Meanwhile, in the southern port town of Madras, passengers and crew of a Canadian cruise ship were screened by port authorities for the disease, a port official said Tuesday. The ``Seawing,'' which arrived in Madras on Sunday from Canada via Singapore, had 900 people on board, including 637 passengers, the official said on condition of anonymity. At least four people have died in Canada from SARS. All passengers and crew were cleared and the ship was allowed to dock. The vessel then sailed for Colombo, Sri Lanka, later Sunday.
