Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will visit Indian-controlled Kashmir this month to a get a firsthand feel of the situation in the insurgency-ridden state, a government official said Tuesday. Vajpayee will spend two days in Jammu-Kashmir state in the third week of April, the official said on condition of anonymity. Citing security concerns, the official did not give any specific dates. The prime minister will review security in the state, where more than a dozen Islamic militant groups have been fighting for its independence from India, or its merger with mostly Muslim Pakistan. Vajpayee was also expected to announce more financial aid to the state's newly elected government, which says it wants to fight militancy by offering jobs and economic incentives to people of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state. The visit comes two years after Vajpayee announced a special 62 billion-rupee (US$1.3 billion) long-term development package for Jammu-Kashmir. The prime minister is also expected to inaugurate the North-South Corridor _ an ambitious road project that will connect Srinagar, the state's summer capital, with Kanyakumari located on the southern tip of India, the official said.
