An explosion Tuesday in a chemical plant owned by the Dutch company DSM killed three people and wounded two, a company official said. The plant in the town of Geleen, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Amsterdam, produces melamine, a chemical component of plastics. A spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition on anonymity, could not confirm Dutch television reports that three others were missing. The precise cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but a municipal spokeswoman said it had occurred at 12:15 p.m. (1015 GMT) during repairs with a welder to a gas-powered boiler. Police and ambulances were summoned quickly to the scene, but town officials were only informed two hours later, said Geleen spokeswoman Bertie Bischops. ``There was an explosion and there are victims. I don't know how many, but there is no threat to the surrounding area,'' she said. No further details were available. Although the Netherlands has a substantial number of industrial manufacturers and chemical companies, fatal accidents are rare. The worst industrial accident in recent years was in May 2000, when 22 people were killed by an explosion at a fireworks storage depot in the eastern town of Enschede. DSM, a blue chip company on the Amsterdam stock exchange, makes coatings, resins and chemicals used in plastics. It employs 20,000 people 40 countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Melamine is a fire-resistant, powdery substance used to make kitchen countertops, protective coatings on currency, car paint and dinner plates. (ad/am)
