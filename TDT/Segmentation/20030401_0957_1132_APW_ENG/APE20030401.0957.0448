House Republicans on Tuesday proposed giving President George W. Bush the entire $74.7 billion he wants to begin paying for the war with Iraq and anti-terrorism costs, but clamping down on the flexibility he sought in deciding how to spend the money. The Republican-run House Appropriations Committee began debating the measure on Tuesday in hopes of approving the legislation quickly, as Bush has requested. Committee Chairman Bill Youn called the bill ``a message to our troops that we believe in them, that we support them and that we encourage them.'' The Senate Appropriations Committee, also led by Republicans, planned to vote on a similar package later in the day that would also put tighter congressional controls on spending the money. When Bush sent his request to Congress last week, he asked lawmakers to rush the funds to him by April 11. For the most part, the House plan followed the broad outlines that Bush requested. It would provide $62.5 billion of the $62.6 billion he proposed for the Pentagon and classified activities; $200 million more than the $7.8 billion he requested for foreign aid; and $69 million less than the nearly $4.3 billion he proposed for tightening security at home. But the House measure would greatly restrict Bush's proposal for large pools of money that the administration could spend with little control by lawmakers. That reflects a long-standing desire by lawmakers of both parties to protect Congress's power to control spending. As Bush proposed, the House bill would provide $1 billion for Israel, $1 billion for Turkey, at least $700 million for Jordan, and more funds for other allies. An extra $250 million was added for food aid.
