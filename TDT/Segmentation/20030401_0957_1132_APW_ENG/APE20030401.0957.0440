Even Mickey Mouse is feeling the Iraqi war's pinch. Abdullah Walid's 7-year-old camel _ named after the American cartoon character _ hasn't taken a tourist on a ride around Cairo's Giza pyramids for days now. ``The war is killing tourism here,'' the 28-year-old father of four Walid told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Egyptian authorities paint an equally bleak picture, saying that because of the war, 1.5 million fewer visitors are expected this year compared to last in a country that depends on tourism for much of its hard currency earnings. Tourism Minister Mamdouh El-Beltagui predicted Monday that as a result of the U.S.-led war, 2003 tourism revenues are expected to fall 38 percent to US$2.25 billion. El-Beltagui said in a statement that hotel occupancy rates were at 40 percent in the first week of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, compared to 59 percent this time last year. Late March is typically a peak time for Egypt's tourism industry, with thousands enjoying the country's warm spring weather, pharaonic sites and Nile cruises. This year, the war in Iraq, on top of more than two years of Israeli-Palestinian violence and the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 attacks, has scared most foreign holiday-makers away. Adel Aziz, group general manager of top Egyptian tour operator Travco, expected worse for his company, predicting a 50 percent drop in business this year. He said employees had been asked to take unpaid leaves. Travco has received more than 2,000 cancellations from one company alone _ leading German tour operator TUI AG _ for March and April, he said. Losses of some 20 million Egyptian pounds (US$3.5 million) are expected during the same time compared to last year. ``Many clients are seeing Egypt as being close to Iraq and think they may be attacked'' because they are Western, Aziz told the AP. ``It is a terrible situation because nothing is clear.'' Two of the few tourists to visit the pyramids Tuesday, British couple Anne and Julian French, said they had no such concerns. ``We've had no problem at all, there is so much security here it is unbelievable. I feel safer than in Britain,'' said Anne French, from the County Kent town of Maidstone, while taking photos of the ancient Sphinx. Across town, Cairo's Khan al-Khalili bazaar is normally bustling with coach loads of tourists and noisy hawkers. But nowadays it resembles a ghost town. ``You just have to see for yourself, the streets are still and the shops are empty,'' said Haithem Magdi, whose family has run a gift store in the famous souk for 30 years. ``It hasn't been this way since the (1997) attack in Luxor'' by Islamic militants that killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians, he said.
