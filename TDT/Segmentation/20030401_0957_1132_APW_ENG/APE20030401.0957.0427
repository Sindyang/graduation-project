Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday dismissed a report that Ukrainian arms dealers sold anti-tank missiles to Iraq as an attempt to discredit the country's leadership. The U.S.-based magazine Newsweek cited unnamed Pentagon officials in its report this week that Ukrainian arms dealers sent about 500 Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles to Baghdad in January. The report said Iraqi forces used the missiles to destroy two U.S. Abrams tanks. ``This is nothing more than another attempt to undermine the authority of our state,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Markian Lybkivskyi said. ``Ukraine did nothing to violate U.N. sanctions ... and sold no weapons to Iraq.'' The issue of illegal supplies to Iraq surfaced a week ago after reports that three Russian companies violated U.N. sanctions by selling military equipment to Baghdad. The Kremlin vigorously denied the U.S. claims. Analysts suggested that third countries could have transferred Russian-made equipment or arms to Iraq. The report of alleged missile sales was the third time Ukraine has been accused of violating sanctions on Iraq. Last year, Washington said it had verified the authenticity of a July 2000 audio recording in which President Leonid Kuchma is allegedly heard approving the sale of four Kolchuha radar systems to Iraq. In January, Ukraine denied selling pontoon bridges to Iraq. Kuchma insisted last week that the U.S.-led war in Iraq would prove his country's innocence. Oksana Antonenko, a security expert at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said well-developed, ``multinational criminal networks'' in Russia and Ukraine are involved in ``open smuggling'' worth billions of dollars. Arms dealers ``actively target'' retired or downsized members of the post-Soviet military to get access to state-of-the-art equipment, she said. ``For them, the opportunity to earn high salaries is not just tempting ... but a matter of survival,'' Antoneko said. Despite its disagreement with Washington, Ukraine began deploying a 532-man anti-chemical weapons battalion to Kuwait last month to help neutralize any Iraqi attack. Ukraine's Defense Ministry announced Tuesday it is trimming the number of troops to 450 based on ``reduced technical needs.'' (tv/sk/jh)
