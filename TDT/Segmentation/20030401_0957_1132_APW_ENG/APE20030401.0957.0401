The once-powerful Gulf drug cartel has been nearly dismantled after the arrest of its leader, Osiel Cardenas, and the man believed to be his successor, Mexican prosecutors said. Victor Manuel Vazquez, who officials believe would have replaced Cardenas, was arrested Friday along with seven other people while drinking in the port city of Veracruz, anti-drug prosecutor Jose Luis Santiago said in a news conference Monday. Two weapons and four vehicles were seized by officials. Cardenas was arrested March 14 during a shootout with police in the border city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. The recent arrests assure that the Gulf cartel ``is practically dismantled,'' Santiago said, adding that recent intelligence reports by police indicate the Gulf cartel is having financial and leadership problems. Based in northeastern Mexico, the Gulf cartel was the strongest of the border-based drug organizations until 1996, when then-leader Juan Garcia Abrego was sentenced in Houston to 11 life terms for drug smuggling. Since taking office in December 2000, President Vicente Fox has focused on crippling the country's powerful drug trade, and police have responded by arresting or killing several high-profile drug lords. Among them were Ramon Arellano Felix, who was fatally shot by police a year ago in the Pacific resort of Mazatlan, and his brother Benjamin, who was arrested a few weeks later at his home in Puebla, 65 miles (105 kms) southeast of Mexico City.
