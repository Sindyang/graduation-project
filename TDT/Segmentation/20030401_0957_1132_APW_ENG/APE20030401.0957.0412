Poland's Cabinet decided Tuesday to send troops trained for chemical warfare protection to Turkey as part of NATO's defenses against a possible Iraqi attack on its neighbor. The 60 soldiers' mission, which requires approval by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, is due to begin Friday and run through Sept. 30, government spokesman Michal Tober said. ``As a credible NATO member, we have a moral and political duty to extend such support,'' Tober said after the decision by Prime Minister Leszek Miller's Cabinet. NATO already has deployed anti-missile batteries and AWACS surveillance planes to defend Turkey in the event of attacks from neighboring Iraq. Poland, which joined NATO in 1999 together with Hungary and the Czech Republic, supports the U.S.-led war in Iraq and has contributed up to 200 troops _ including 56 members of the elite GROM commando unit. Poland's stand has put it at odds with leading European powers opposed to the war, notably France and Germany. ^ (ajs-tc) &lt;
