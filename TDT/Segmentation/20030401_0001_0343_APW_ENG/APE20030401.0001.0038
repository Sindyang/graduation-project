Boeing Capital Corp. asked a federal bankruptcy judge to replace Hawaiian Airlines Inc.'s ``self-dealing'' management with a trustee to oversee the carrier. The motion, filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Honolulu, comes 10 days after Hawaiian, the larger of the state's two major airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 frees a company from the threat of creditors' lawsuits while it reorganizes its finances. Unless the court rules otherwise, the debtor remains in control of the business and its assets. ``Hawaiian's management _ in particular, John W. Adams, Hawaiian's chairman, chief executive officer and majority shareholder _ has conclusively demonstrated that its extensive self-dealing and inherent conflicts of interests require appointment of a trustee,'' the motion said. Seattle-based Boeing Capital, the financial arm of Boeing Co., is Hawaiian's main lessor. The others are International Lease Finance Corp. and Ansett Worldwide Aviation Inc. At the end of 2002, Hawaiian was Boeing Capital's fifth-largest client, with $476 million in lease agreements. Boeing claims that company insiders and Adams _ who holds 50.9 percent of the parent company's stock and has the right to nominate six of its 11 board members _ reaped nearly 70 percent of a $25 million stock repurchase plan the company began in April 2002. And despite Hawaiian's struggling financial condition, Adams' salary rose from $200,000 in 2000 to $600,000 in 2002, the motion said. ``(The motion) is not a common thing for us, in fact this is unprecedented for Boeing Capital, but it was absolutely necessary based on past actions of Hawaiian's management,'' Boeing Capital spokesman Russ Young said. ``We feel that if a trustee is appointed, the interests of the creditors will be properly protected.'' Hawaiian disputed Boeing's claims and said it was disappointed by the request. ``While we have not yet had an opportunity review the motion, we believe it is a thinly veiled attempt by Boeing to distract the company and the court during the 60-day statutory period which the company is afforded the opportunity to renegotiate its leases,'' the company said in a statement. After receiving more than $30 million in federal grants to stabilize the airline industry following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Hawaiian's board of directors used the proceeds as a ``reward'' to shareholders, principally Adams and other company insiders, the motion said. The motion also questioned the motive behind the March 21 bankruptcy filing, which Hawaiian at the time said was a result of failing ``to reach agreement with certain of our aircraft lessors on reducing our lease rates to market levels.'' Boeing Capital said Hawaiian was seeking $20 million per year from its lessors in contract modifications and concessions. Hawaiian was founded in 1929 and is the nation's 12th-largest airline, carrying more than 6 million passengers a year. It has 27 Boeing aircraft including 14 767-300 and 13 717-200. Boeing Capital has a stake in 16 of the planes. _ _ _ On the Net: Boeing Capital Corp: http://www.boeing.com/bcc/flash.html Hawaiian Airlines: http://www.hawaiianair.com
