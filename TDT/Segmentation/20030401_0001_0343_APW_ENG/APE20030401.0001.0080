The Chinese government's official news agency issued a call Tuesday to ``the world's overweight'': Come live on a dusty plateau in northwestern China and lose that annoying flab. ``The world's overweight could achieve significant weight loss through living in a low-oxygen plateau environment for a period of time,'' the Xinhua News Agency said. It quoted a Professor Gerili, director of what it called the Plateau Medical Research Center, but provided no other details. Calls to the Research Center for High Altitude Medicine at Qinghai Medical College, where a ``Gerili'' was listed as director, went unanswered Tuesday. Last year, the center surveyed 115 workers engaged in the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet railway on China's western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the ``world's roof.'' The survey showed an average weight loss of 10.2 percent of body weight after one month of hard work at an altitude of 4,000 meters (13,100 feet), Xinhua said. Gerili was quoted as saying that the people surveyed had been working normally and hadn't ``undergone especially intense exercise or diets of any kind.'' The results also indicated that those with more excess weight lost more weight in the plateau environment, Xinhua said. It cited what it called evidence that lack of oxygen assists weight loss. Gerili was quoted as suggesting that body building and weight-loss centers be built on the plateau _ where, according to Xinhua, ``obesity can be easily overcome through pleasant recreational activities and moderate physical exercise.'' China already has tried to put its loftiest areas to aerobic use, dispatching its Olympic runners to train at high altitudes in Tibet in hopes of increasing their lung capacity.
