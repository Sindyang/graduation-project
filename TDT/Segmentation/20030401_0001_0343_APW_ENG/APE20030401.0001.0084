French counterterrorism experts are coming to Pakistan later this month to help the government in its battle against terrorism, a senior Interior Ministry official said Tuesday. ``The French team will help train our forensic experts,'' Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema, the ministry's director general, told The Associated Press. ``They can also be helpful in training our anti-terrorism experts,'' he said. Pakistan's Interior Minister Minister Faisal Saleh Hayyat was in France last week for talks on increased cooperation, particularly in counterterrorism. Pakistan is a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism next door in Afghanistan. Militants outraged by Pakistan's cooperation have staged several attacks against foreigners and Pakistani Christians. Among the victims were 11 French engineers, who were helping Pakistan build submarines. The engineers were killed in a suicide bombing last year in the southern city of Karachi.
