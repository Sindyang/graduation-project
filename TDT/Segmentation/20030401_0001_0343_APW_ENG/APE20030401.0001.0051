North Korea test-fired a ground-to-ship missile Tuesday, Japanese officials said, just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. A Japanese military official said the firing was a routine test and posed no immediate security threat. Japan's satellite launch angered the communist state, which threatened to test-fire a missile. The launch Tuesday added to growing fears in Japan that the reclusive state may take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. The short-range missile, with a range of about 60 kilometers (37 miles), was fired from the northwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula, Japanese defense agency and transport ministry officials said. Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces, Japan's navy, said the missile was likely a routine test. He played down its possible dangers and told reporters that his forces were not placed on any special alert. In Washington, a Pentagon official confirmed the launch of the missile but said the United States does not view it as a threat. A spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry said on condition of anonymity the missile-firing would not worsen the crisis over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, noting it was not fired toward Japan. But the U.S. military said Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. Japanese Defense Agency spokesman Manabu Shimamoto said the agency was still checking into where the missile fell but added it was ``impossible to reach Japan.'' North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean in 1998. It is believed to possess missiles that may reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared in October last year, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.
