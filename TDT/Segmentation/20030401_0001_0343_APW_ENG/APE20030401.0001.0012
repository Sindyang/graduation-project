Rescue officials struggled early Tuesday to reach victims buried by a landslide that roared through a remote gold-mining town in Bolivia's tropical lowlands and killed at least four people. ``It's still too early to estimate the level of damage,'' said La Paz Gov. Mateo Laura, who is leading a rescue mission that has been delayed by heavy rains and bad roads to the jungle town of Chima, 125 miles (200 kilometers) north of the capital La Paz. ``We simply have had no contact with the town,'' he said. ``To talk about death numbers would be inappropriate.'' The landslide early Monday buried dozens of homes and left at least three people injured in the town of about 3,000 impoverished gold-miners and their families, who have been burrowing into the mountain for the past 70 years in search of a meager living. Government officials say the disaster may have been caused by gold-mining operations that weakened a nearby mountain. Villagers spent the afternoon digging through a mountain of mud, rock and muck to reach survivors. Rescue officials were expected to begin arriving at the remote village, about 12 hours by road from the capital, early Tuesday morning. The government's only form of communication with the village so far had been a small radio at the gold mine. The U.S. Embassy in La Paz offered rescue crews and the use of four helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane. But they were not expected to arrive before Wednesday afternoon because there is no refueling point in the Bolivian jungle. It was still unclear how many people were affected by the landslide. Local officials backed off on initial reports that said 400 homes had been destroyed and many people were missing. ``I want to insist, the disaster is not of the enormous magnitude as we at first thought,'' said Amadeo Herrera, a Chima resident who spoke on La Paz radio station Fides. Herrera said he spoke to mining officials by radio, who reported 10 dead and eight injured. State officials could only confirm four dead and three injured. Officials said many people were working in the mines when the mountain collapsed, but gave no other details. ``It's clear there are people injured, missing and some dead,'' said Oscar Mina, head of La Paz's public security unit. ``But the big problem is all the confusion this has caused. We've received all types of information.'' One of the few buildings spared by the landslide was the village schoolhouse, said Toridio Mercado, deputy mayor of Tipuani, a neighboring village with a clinic receiving the injured. ``The situation is urgent,'' Mercado said. ``We don't have even the basic resources. We have two doctors and they need gauze, syringes, plaster and body bags.'' The village suffered a similar landslide two years ago that left eight dead. Authorities say that mining tunnels have continually undermined the mountain and put it at risk of collapse.
