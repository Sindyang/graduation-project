Communist rebels evacuated a small train station, then blew it up early Tuesday in eastern Bihar state, said a railway official. There were no injuries, but extensive damage was caused to the building, the rail track and the communication system at Nadaul, 45 kilometers (30 miles) south of Patna, the state capital, said assistant railway divisional manager A.K. Verma. He said traffic had been halted on the line between Patna and Gaya, the site of major Buddhist temples. Verma said militants of the People's War Group had evacuated the staff at Nadaul station before setting off the explosion. The group, along with another outlawed rebel outfit, the Maoist Communist Center, had called for a statewide dawn to dusk strike in Bihar on Tuesday to protest police brutality and the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Police had blamed the militants for a similar explosion on Saturday at the Gomada train station in Vizianagaram district in Andhra Pradesh state, after the staff was evacuated. The rebels are active in five southern and eastern Indian states and draw inspiration from Chinese revolutionary Mao Zedong in their demands for sweeping land reforms. More than 6,000 people have been killed since they began fighting two decades ago. They usually target landowners, politicians and police.
