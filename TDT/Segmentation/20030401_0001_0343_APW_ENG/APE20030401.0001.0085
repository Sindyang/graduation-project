Tourism in Asia is on the sick bed _ a casualty of war, disease and terror. Travel companies across the continent are watching with dismay the flood of cancellations in hotels and airlines, while worried governments brace for massive revenue losses. Tourism _ a pillar of most Asian economies _ plunged after the Sept. 11, 2001 Islamic terrorist attacks in the United States, which compelled nervous Americans and other foreigners to stay at home. Even more stayed away after 200 people, mostly foreign vacationers, were killed last October when two bombs ripped through a crowded nightclub district on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. Despite the carnage, there had been hopes that visitors will come back to the idyllic tropical beaches and the bustling bazaars of Asia. But now the travel industry has taken back-to-back hits -- the U.S.-led invasion on Iraq and the mysterious deadly flu-like disease that's spreading across the region and beyond. At least 62 people have died and 1,600 been stricken by severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, on three continents with Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Vietnam and Canada being the worst-hit. ``These days threats to tourism come in all shapes and sizes. It could be microbes, terrorists or global leaders,'' said Imtiaz Muqbil, a Bangkok-based travel analyst. ``Tourism in Asia will probably go into a comatose state for a while. Whether it dies or revives will depend on how quickly the whole package of violence-terror-disease abates,'' said Muqbil, the editor of Travel Impact News Wire. Industry experts say the war on Iraq has virtually dried up the flow of Americans and Middle Easterners to Asia. And, while a majority of travelers in Asia are Asians, they too are now staying at home thanks to the SARS crisis, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association, an apex body for the region's industry operators. ``It is not the best situation. The real concern is how long, how hard the crisis will last and what would be the flow-on affects,'' said John Koldowski, PATA's chief strategic planner. The numbers being tallied by governments in Asia make for depressing reading -- tourist arrivals in Thailand dropped 10 percent in March compared with a year ago; Philippines reported a 4 percent drop in the first quarter of this year; about 50 percent of Malaysians booked on flights to China, Hong Kong and Vietnam before the SARS scare have canceled or postponed. No surprises here, given how widely the media are circulating the holiday-from-hell pictures and words -- surgical masks selling out in Beijing and Hong Kong; the Catholic church in Singapore no longer placing the Holy Communion wafer on the tongue; air travelers greeted at airports and in aircraft by staff wearing surgical masks; an entire apartment block quarantined in Hong Kong. The Rolling Stones rock band canceled concerts in Hong Kong and China. An international women's ice hockey tournament scheduled to begin this week in Beijing was also called off. Keum Gi-hyung of South Korea's tourism ministry said the number of inbound tourists is may have dropped 20 percent this month. The South Korean government has asked people to avoid nonessential travel to affected areas. Vietnam's biggest tour operator, Saigon Tourist, reported a 22 percent drop in foreign tourist business compared to last year. ``We have been hit hard by the SARS and the ongoing war in Iraq,'' said Nguyen Phuong Thien of Saigon Tourist. ``The tourism industry is clearly one of the most fragile and sensitive industries in the world. The impact of scare stories _ whether it is terrorism, war or viruses _ is just absolutely phenomenal. People are paranoid about their safety,'' said Muqbil, the travel analyst. A research by Thai Farmers Bank said the combined effect of the Iraq war and SARS could cut 30 billion baht (US$ 697 million) from Thailand's tourism revenue this year, earlier expected at 375 billion baht (US$ 8.7 billion). Growth in2003 tourist arrivals could drop to 1.9 percent from an earlier projection of 8.3 percent, it said. ``I believe it will hit not only us but the whole region,'' said Thailand's Tourism Minister Sontaya Kunplome. The Tourism Authority of Thailand said 50,000 tourists, mainly Europeans, have canceled their bookings for April and May. In response, the Thai Hotels Association agreed to slash room rates by 20 percent for a three-month period starting from April. Airlines are also feeling the pinch. Thai Airways announced on Monday it cut 28 flights to some destinations while similar cuts were announced by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific, Taiwan's China Airlines and Air India. Thai Airways stock price plunged 7.6 percent to a five month low on Tuesday. Qantas Airways said Monday it would reduce its domestic fares by up to 40 percent as more Australians decide to stay home while the war in Iraq continues. The corporate world is also avoiding traveling. ``Travel to places like China, Vietnam and Singapore has definitely been curtailed. We are basically relying on video-conferencing and teleconferencing to keep in touch with our colleagues there,'' Emerson Electric India president Pradita Sen said. Countries that have been relatively untouched by SARS are making it known to the world, hoping to wean away undecided travelers to Singapore and Hong Kong. ``I want the world to know we don't have SARS,'' said Philippine Tourism Secretary Richard Gordon, urging people to visit his country. Muqbil, the analyst, says peace, stability, safety and good health have become a country's main tourism competitive advantage. ``Once upon a time the beauty of your country, the price of hotels, airlines, the quality of product were among the factors creating competitive advantage. Those days are gone, forever.'' Experts hope that the industry will regain health once the SARS virus has been contained and the war in Iraq finishes. ``The fascinating thing is that the industry has shown its resilience time and time again. When stability is shown, the numbers rebound rapidly,'' said Koldowski, the PATA executive. ``These days for a vast majority of travelers international travel is no longer a luxury. It is a necessity.''
