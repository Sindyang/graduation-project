South Korea's Defense Ministry said there was no evidence that North Korea had test-fired a missile Tuesday. Earlier, the Pentagon and Japanese authorities had said Pyongyang launched a short-range ground-to-ship missile off its northwest coast. ``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting reports. Before the Defense Ministry statement, a spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry said the alleged launch was ``routine.''
