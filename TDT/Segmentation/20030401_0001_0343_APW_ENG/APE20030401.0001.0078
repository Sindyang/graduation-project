The Australian government on Tuesday defended its tough imported food quarantine rules and said the European Union should spend more time weaning its farmers off subsidies and less attacking Australia's system. The European Union announced Monday it would challenge Australia's quarantine system for farm imports at the World Trade Organization, saying the measures unfairly protect domestic producers. ``We believe this system flagrantly breaches WTO rules, despite Australia's constant claims to be the only beacon of free agricultural trade,'' EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said. The EU requested formal consultations at the WTO, a move that could lead to a ruling by the global trade regulator on the legality of the Australian system. The EU action and Australia's reaction marked an escalation of a long-running dispute over agricultural trade. Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile vigorously defended the country's quarantine system, which in the past has banned imports of products like fruit because they might be infected with pests not yet found in Australia. ``Australia has a world-class quarantine system that is science-based and transparent,'' Vaile said in a statement. ``The EU's system is not transparent and some of their decisions are clearly not science-based,'' he added, without elaborating. Vaile said instead of wasting time on a WTO case that would fail, the EU should focus on cutting subsidies to its farmers. ``Australia will not be distracted from continuing to press ahead with agricultural trade reform in the WTO,'' he said. ``The EU's efforts would be better directed towards weaning its farmers from subsidies and getting on with the process of agriculture reform.'' The EU accused Australia of double standards by pushing for freer world agricultural trade _ including the reduction of EU farm subsidies _ while protecting its own market through over-stringent health regulations. Earlier Tuesday, the Australian government blamed the EU and Japan for the WTO's failure to meet a key deadline on farm trade reform. Vaile said the missed deadline of March 31, under which members of the Geneva-based WTO were supposed to agree on a broad framework for liberalizing agricultural trade, was a serious setback for the latest round of global trade talks. ``The responsibility for this failure lies squarely at the feet of those members, such as the European Union and Japan, who are continuing to oppose efforts to bring about genuine reform of agricultural trade,'' Vaile said. Australia is a prominent member of the Cairns Group of 18 nations with major farming industries and a commitment to liberalizing agricultural trade. Vaile said he will discuss the state of farm trade negotiations with other members of the group over coming weeks and hopes to build political momentum for progress on trade reform. Australia is a major exporter of farm goods such as beef and wheat and has vigorously pushed for more liberal trade rules on agricultural products.
