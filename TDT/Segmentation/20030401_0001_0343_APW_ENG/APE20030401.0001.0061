The former backup singer of imprisoned Mexican pop idol Gloria Trevi arrived in Mexico on Monday after Brazilian authorities extradited her on charges of rape, kidnapping and corruption of minors. Maria Raquenel Portillo, known as ``Mary Boquitas,'' was brought late Monday night to the maximum-security prison where Trevi is being held in Chihuahua, 760 miles (1,215 kilometers) northwest of Mexico City. Portillo was accompanied by her mother and six lawyers, including Trevi's lawyer, Cesar Fentanes, who announced that he was going to represent Portillo free of charge. ``We are going to prove her innocence to the authorities that have brought this case,'' Fentanes said, as a tired-looking Portillo was led into the prison. Portillo did not make a statement, but was to present a written declaration during a court appearance on Tuesday, Fentanes said. Brazilian authorities turned Portillo over to Mexican officials earlier Monday. During a layover in Mexico City, she blew kisses to onlookers but declined to make a statement before being whisked away for a medical checkup. At the request of Mexican authorities, Portillo was arrested along with Trevi and Trevi's manager, Sergio Andrade, in January 2000 in Rio de Janeiro. Prosecutors say the three recruited teenage girls for live-in musical training and forced them to have sex with Andrade. Trevi was extradited to Mexico on Dec. 21, after three years of fighting extradition while imprisoned in Brazil, where she gave birth to Andrade's son. She also faces charges of rape, kidnapping and corruption of minors. Portillo, 33, was not extradited in December because of health problems. Andrade remains in a federal police lockup in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia, and has pledged to use every legal recourse to avoid extradition. Nicknamed ``Mexico's Madonna,'' Trevi, 34, was known for her rebellious lyrics and audaciously sexual performances, which helped make her one of Mexico's biggest stars in the early 1990s.
