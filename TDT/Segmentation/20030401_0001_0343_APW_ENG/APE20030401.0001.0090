A veteran lawmaker from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's conservative party became the nation's new agriculture minister Tuesday after his predecessor resigned over a bribery scandal. Yoshiyuki Kamei, a seven-term lawmaker from the Liberal Democratic Party, was appointed minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a ceremony at Tokyo's Imperial Palace. ``I am fully aware of the heavy responsibility of this appointment,'' he told reporters. Kamei replaced Tadamori Oshima, who resigned Monday to take responsibility for allegations that an aide had accepted dubious political donations. Oshima was not personally implicated in the affair. But his resignation was another black mark for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who swept to power in 2001 on a reformist platform that included promises to make his party more transparent and accountable to voters. Two Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have been arrested in money-related scandals since last year. Kamei, 66, formerly served as transport minister under then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1996. He takes over the job at a time that Japan's farm policy is under fire from some of its trading partners. The Japanese government strongly opposes a proposal at the World Trade Organization to slash global tariffs on agricultural products, including Japanese rice imports. Farmers are among the most loyal supporters of Koizumi's party.
