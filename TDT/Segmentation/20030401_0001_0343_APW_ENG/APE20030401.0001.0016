Cuban authorities were negotiating early Tuesday at Havana's airport with a man who claimed to be carrying two grenades on a plane with 46 other people aboard that he unsuccessfully tried to hijack to the United States. Authorities said the plane was forced to land in Havana due to insufficient fuel after it was hijacked on a regular flight to the Cuban capital from the small Isle of Youth late Monday. A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement, distributed to international reporters here. The statement blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana said is the lax treatment of six other suspected hijackers who successfully forced another passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at knifepoint on March 19. The suspected hijackers were charged by U.S. authorities with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence, but were granted bond pending trial on the federal charges. However, they couldn't make the bond payments and remain in detention. ``The entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. Six crew members and 25 passengers were on the twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on March 19 when knife-wielding hijackers took control of the plane as it descended toward Havana after a flight from the Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key West. Cuban authorities later reported that the plane barely had enough fuel to get to American soil. The earlier hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched. American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West.
