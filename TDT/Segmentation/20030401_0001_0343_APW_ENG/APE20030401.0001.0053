India will spend 400 billion rupees (US$8.3 billion) over the next five years on power sector reforms in an attempt to overcome serious energy shortages. Losses due to poor infrastructure and power theft amount to 260 billion rupees (US$5.4 billion) a year in India, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said after the federal Cabinet approved the proposal Monday. Several foreign investors have fled India after a decade of failed power reforms and policy wrangles, and domestic investors are wary of the power sector. Poorly maintained equipment and use of electricity lines by nonpaying customers often lead to power blackouts. Nearly 200 billion rupees (US$4.15 billion) will be spent over the next five years on strengthening the power infrastructure in India's 29 states, Dow Jones Newswires reported. An equal amount will be used to cut the accumulated losses of state electricity boards, which generate and distribute power, Swaraj told reporters. ``We have to give incentives to states to cut their losses,'' she said. Reducing distribution losses was likely to save 6,000-7,000 megawatts of electricity per hour, a government statement said. India needs to generate an additional 11,000 megawatts per hour to meet its power requirements. Nuclear power supplies about 3 percent of India's electricity. The government plans to increase that to 10 percent by 2005 in an effort to tackle the country's serious energy shortages.
