A swath of southern Iraq has been called many things: Land of the swamp people. Mother of all untapped oil reserves. Scene of the worst environmental crime in history. Cradle of civilization. Saddam's slaughterhouse. At the moment, it is a 21st century battlefield. But the great expanse known to scientists as the Mesopotamia Marshlands figures to be one of keys to what will become of postwar Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein purportedly drained these wetlands _ satellite images show only 7 percent of the fragile ecosystem still intact _ as part of his campaign to crush Shiite Muslims who rebelled against him in 1991. Geologists believe fabulous sources of untapped oil percolate beneath sections of this expanse, which was half the size of Switzerland little more than a decade ago. Yet some environmental engineers advocate reflooding the region to restore the habitat, the surviving fraction of which still harbors the vestiges of rare birds, fish and what remains of a 5,000-year-old subculture known as the Marsh Arabs, people who live on floating islands handmade from enormous reeds. In an arid, windblown region where oil means wealth but water means survival, dueling forces stand ready to shape the fate of the Fertile Crescent that provided the right ingredients to spawn Mesopotamia, the first civilization. ``The marshes happen to be on top of the some of the greatest untapped reserves of oil,'' said Mark Bartolini, Middle East director for the International Rescue Committee. ``Are we going to flood the marshes for the people who lived there for millennia?'' The relief organization has targeted for aid the roughly 200,000 Iraqi Shiites living as refugees in neighboring Iran. Most fled in the wake of Saddam's defeat in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, after which Shiites in southern Iraq _ along with Kurds in the north _ staged uprisings against what they thought was a brutal ruler vulnerable to overthrow. Saddam rallied his troops and crushed both rebellions, then waged a decade-long campaign to slaughter the Shiite usurpers. Since many were from the marshlands, human rights groups say he accelerated the draining and seeming destruction of the bogs. Ramadan Albadran grew up in the swamps around al Amara in a house built from clay and reeds, a veritable vineyard growing on the roof. As a young man, he participated in the rebellion, then fled to Saudi Arabia for his life. ``Most of my friends were killed,'' said Albadran, 39, who was granted refugee status and now lives in Los Angeles. Yet he'd go back to the swamps if he could. There was nothing quite like sitting on the porch in the cool morning breeze, admiring the view of the Tigris river, eating a peach or pomegranate plucked from the surrounding forest of fruit. ``You had to use a boat to pick the fruit,'' he said. ``But you could catch any kind of fish without leaving the house.'' Though Saddam gets most of the blame for destroying the marshes, neighboring Turkey and Syria have played a role by damming rivers upstream to irrigate farms. Iran is building a huge dam that the U.N. Environment Program believes will further drain the marsh. Preserving the remaining 7 percent _ down from 10 percent just two years ago _ is crucial because it provides a template for restoring much of the rest of the marshes, said Hassan Partow, a UN environmentalist in Geneva. The wetlands are the last redoubt for such rare species as the African darter fish and the Sacred Ibis bird, and a pit stop for many migratory birds. Creatures unique to the marshland might even be gone, such as the smooth-covered otter, the bandicoot rat and the buni fish, he said. The marsh also served a crucial role in protecting the Persian Gulf and its vibrant fishery, said Tom Crisman, a University of Florida environmental engineer and director of the school's Center for Wetlands. Before Saddam used a system of dikes and canals to divert the river waters, the intricate maze of pools, streams and marshes was a dazzling delta that sprawled to the horizon. Refugees now describe much of it as an ocean of fetid mud with polluted groundwater, sprinkled with garbage and land mines. Other sections are dry and dusty, dotted with the flattened, crinkled remains of the magnificent stands of reeds that once stood up to 15 feet tall. The war is likely to leave a legacy of unexploded ordinance and other, less-lethal, refuse of combat. Some of the heaviest fighting has taken place in the marsh areas, particularly around the cities of Nasariyha, Basra and Umm Qasr. In addition to being a remarkable wildlife habitat, the marshes served a crucial role in the health and nutrition of the whole Persian Gulf region, Crisman said. The marshes were an important source of protein, in the form of fish and water buffalo, and served as a filter for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that flank and feed it. Wetlands act as natural wastewater treatment systems for waterway contaminants. Now the two rivers are carrying waste from Iraq directly into the Persian Gulf, Crisman said, posing a threat to a fishery on which the entire Gulf region depends. Though Iraq is second only to Saudi Arabia in proven oil reserves, 90 percent of the country is unexplored because of 23 years of wars and global sanctions, according to the U.S. Energy Intelligence Agency. ``I'm not sure how many untapped reserves lie in the marshes, but it's certainly a prolific oil-bearing region,'' said Lowell Feld of the Energy Intelligence Agency. ``So, it is fair to say that there's probably a lot more oil to be found in the area.'' With the prospect of the prison-like country opening its doors, oil companies around the world are hungrily eyeing a postwar Iraq, said Ruba Husari, London-based researcher for the industry research firm Energy Intelligence Group. ``Everybody is interested,'' she said. The Russian company Lukoil signed a contract for the West Qurna field in 1997, but Iraq voided it last December after the Russian government lobbied the Bush administration to let the contract stand should the Americans conquer Iraq and form a new government. Even in January, as war appeared imminent, Russia was in Iraq, negotiating for the rights to either the Majnoon or Nah bin Umar fields, she said. Those fields overlap the marshlands. Hassan said the oil production could provide the revenue needed to restore the Mesopotamia Marshlands to some semblance of its past splendor. Although the oil companies have wealth and power on their side, the marshlands restoration project is backed by an Iraqi opposition group lightly funded by the U.S. government. Crisman, a scientist on the project's advisory committee, said at some point ``the oil companies will have to be engaged.'' Project Director Suzie Alwash said the restoration project _ called ``Eden Again'' _ has just hired its first full-time staffer and hasn't had the time or resources to coordinate yet with the petroleum firms. ``It kind of depends on which oil companies get the deals,'' she said. ``If it's a Russian oil company, I don't think we're going to get much help. But if it's an American oil company, we may be able to do something.'' But Alwash, a geologist, said there is no hard evidence that there is oil under all the marshlands, but that the vast region could accommodate both petroleum and paradise. There are half a million Marsh Arabs, most of them displaced and many living in refugee camps, and Eden Again's goal is to make the swamps suitable to restore their culture _ an environmental and anthropological task of perhaps unprecedented proportions. ``An ecosystem has a memory. The sediments are there from thousands of years,'' Crisman said. ``But what about the cultural memory? It's much shorter. Can the people, can their culture rebound? It's a whole new ballgame.'' The future of the marshlands are an example of a larger issue facing the custodians of postwar Iraq, said J. Brian Atwood, dean of the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and former director of the U.S. Agency for International Development. ``The one thing that is crucial about the reconstruction is that the Iraqis play a large part in the process and we pay attention to them and understand the importance of the culture, such as these marshlands,'' Atwood said. ``The Iraqi people are not used to being listened to,'' he said, ``and it would be mistake to continue that attitude.''
