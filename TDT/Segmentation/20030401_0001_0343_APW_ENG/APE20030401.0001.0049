The first confirmed case of a deadly flu-like illness in Australia was a British tourist who has already recovered and flown home without spreading the virus to anybody else, health authorities said Tuesday. The man, whose identity and hometown were not released, had been in Singapore and was successfully treated in a Sydney hospital in late February, said Australia's chief medical officer Richard Smallwood. Smallwood said Monday it was only a matter of time before a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which has killed more than 60 people worldwide, arrived in Australia. Two people in New South Wales state and one person in Australia's capital, Canberra, are still under investigation for the illness, he said. The British tourist arrived in Australia on Feb. 12 after spending two days in Singapore. He was taken to a hospital in Sydney on Feb. 23 with a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. ``The person recovered after two weeks and was well when released from hospital,'' Smallwood said in a statement. ``He was very effectively cared for, all his contacts were traced and he did not pass his disease on to anybody else,'' Smallwood said at a news conference. ``He has recovered and I understand he has gone home so there is no risk to anyone in Australia as a result of his being in the country.'' Australian health authorities have investigated more than 30 suspected cases of SARS in the past three weeks. None were found to fit the World Health Organization criteria for SARS, except the man treated in Sydney, Smallwood said. Smallwood said authorities were not 100 percent sure the tourist had SARS, but had listed him as a confirmed case with the WHO to be safe. SARS has now infected more than 1,600 people in 15 countries. Smallwood also announced measures in Australia to help prevent travelers from spreading the disease. The new directives would include airline pilots having to declare _ before landing _ if they had any sick people on board who would need attention at the airport. Anyone suspected of having the illness would be treated immediately at the airport, Smallwood said.
