Otis Elevator Co. on Tuesday marks 150 years in business, from its start using a platform hooked to a rope and wagon spring to a worldwide company that lifts passengers billions of times on the strength of a computer chip. The company, which began with the sale of a safety elevator by founder Elisha Graves Otis in 1853, has 1.3 million elevators in service around the world. It sells about 80,000 elevators a year and 8,000 escalators. ``But we're not really a manufacturing company,'' said Ari Bousbib, president of Otis. ``There's nothing secret in manufacturing cabs.'' The real business is maintenance. Sensors, monitors, circuits, hardware and computer software are now used to collect and analyze information on hundreds of elevator functions. If a problem is detected, mechanics are dispatched to fix it and restore service. ``What I would like to see is zero maintenance in elevators in the future,'' Bousbib said. ``We're far from that.'' Otis is observing its anniversary in New York with a three-day conference and other events during the year for customers and employees. Fewer employees will participate than would have before recent job cuts. Otis employs 60,000 workers worldwide, with about 7,000 in the United States. That's down from about 63,000 internationally four or five years ago, with 8,000 to 10,000 in the United States. Otis, which once operated six manufacturing plants in the United States, now runs only a small facility in Bloomington, Indiana. The company has plants in Nogales, Mexico; Brazil; the Czech Republic; Russia and China. Otis, which installed its first commercial passenger elevator in a five-story department store in New York in 1857, said its latest models don't even require a machine room. The elevator features flat polyurethane-coated steel belts instead of steel cables that have been the industry standard since the 1800s. The belts are about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) wide and 0.1 inch (0.25 centimeters) thick, but are as strong as steel cables and more durable and flexible, the company said. The thinness of the belts reduces the space required for the machine in the hoistway. The company was purchased by United Technologies for $400 million in 1975. Revenue in 2002 was $6.8 billion, up by more than 7 percent from the previous year. That represented the strongest gains among the parent's subsidiaries, which include Pratt &amp; Whitney, Sikorsky and Carrier. Bousbib foresees more changes for the elevator. ``An elevator is more complex than a car,'' he said. ``You go into an elevator, you press a button and it takes you where you want to go.''
