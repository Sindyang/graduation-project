Burrowed in the sweltering desert, U.S. infantrymen ring a stark temple of a moon god and the sand-swept ruins of a city where 6,000 years ago civilization first budded and from which, it is said, three great religions blossomed. In the opening days of the war, U.S. forces drove through Ur, home to the Biblical Abraham and an ingenious population that irrigated fields, forged agricultural tools and devised the written word. The fighting, which continues in the nearby southern Iraq city of Nasiriyah, has so far spared the remains of Ur and the two families guarding them, who have worked as guides there for generations. ``We are proud,'' Dhief Nauos said Monday of his job as custodian of one of Iraq's greatest historic treasures. Five other men, standing outside two humble family compounds, nodded in agreement. But their immediate concerns were not about past glory, the lack of tourists, or even the war, but about their empty well and dwindling food stocks. Electric power also had been cut off. They have not been allowed into Nasiriyah, past roadblocks where U.S. troops try to ferret out soldiers in civilian clothes and hardline civilian supporters of the Iraqi regime. American units from the nearby Tallil Air Base have given them only 10 bottles of water, the men said. The two extended families _ 25 people, including 15 children _ portrayed themselves as isolated from the ebb and flow of the conflict, harming nobody. ``We only love our country,'' said Dhief's 71-year-old father, Muhsen Nauos, committing himself to neither President Saddam Hussein nor the American forces surrounding him. Troops of the 141st Mechanized Infantry Battalion are spread out around the ruins, situated on a rise in the otherwise flat, rocky desert terrain that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The 4,000-year-old temple, a massive ziggurat of fired mud bricks, rises about 70 feet high, its fortress-like silhouette etched hard into the featureless landscape. A stairway on its eastern side led the ancient Sumerians toward heaven and closer to their moon god Nanna. Founded about 4,000 B.C., Ur's golden age came from 2113 to shortly before 2000 B.C., when King Ur-Nammu expanded the Sumerian empire and made his capital the wealthiest city in Mesopotamia. Arts and literature flourished under his successors until enemies destroyed the city. By the 4th century B.C., Ur had all but faded into the desert, possibly because the Euphrates River, which once flowed near its walls and gave it profitable access to the sea, had shifted course. Both the Bible and the Quran, Islam's holy book, tell of Abraham's two sons migrating from the city, Isaac westward to Canaan to sire the Jewish race and through it Christianity. Ishmael headed to the Arabian peninsula to lay Islam's foundations. ``Abraham is the father of prophets. This is a sacred place to all religions,'' Dhief said in English learned from guiding foreign tourists in times of peace. Dhief, 44, said Ur attracted a steady flow of visitors from Europe, the United States and the Arab world until the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S. troops briefly occupied the area. Tourism fell to 75 percent of pre-war days but scientific excavation continued until about a month before the American attack. The ruins of Ur were discovered and first excavated by the British in the mid-19th century and their work continued until the 1930s. Muhsen, a meagerly paid government civil servant, said his uncle had helped the British in the 1920s. From the desert sands, archaeologists resurrected the remains of a fortress and residential quarters, thousands of tablets in the cuneiform writing system and a royal cemetery dating to about 2600 B.C. containing treasures of gold, silver and precious metals. Evidence showed the death of the queen and king was followed by the suicides of their attendants, musicians and bodyguards. In 1961, said the caretakers, the ziggurat underwent a major facelift. The original inner core, which contained no chambers, was shored up with an outer brick wall, some 75 percent reconstructed from new material. Beneath these temple ramparts, Capt. Stanton Trotter, a U.S. army chaplain, spoke with an Iraqi interpreter attached to U.S. troops. They compared references to Ur and Abraham in the Bible and Quran. The interpreter, who had fled to the West, recalled how as a child, Jewish and Muslim families in his homeland had lived side by side in harmony. ``We Islamics and Jews are cousins and now we are fighting,'' said the interpreter, unleashing a stream of expletives about politicians.
