A wave of suicide bombings threatened by Iraq could entrap U.S.-led forces in a cycle of attack and response, prolong the war and hamper crucial efforts to win the trust of Iraqi civilians, Israelis and Palestinians said, drawing on their experience from scores of such attacks over the past 2{ years. Suicide attacks are difficult to prevent _ a reality underscored Sunday by a 20-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank who blew himself up in the Israeli town of Netanya, evading a dragnet of Israeli checkpoints. Israel says it has scored many successes, intercepting dozens of bombers and dismantling explosives labs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Yet more than 90 bombers have managed to get through in the last 2{ years _ despite Israel's reoccupation of much of the West Bank, crippling travel bans on Palestinians, the arrests of thousands of suspected militants and the targeted killings of dozens. The crackdown has hurt Israel's standing in the world _ and Saddam Hussein appears to be trying to do the same to the United States. The Iraqi leader has tried to rally the Arab world behind him by copying the Palestinian model, the most sustained campaign of suicide attacks ever. After the first suicide attack against U.S. forces at a checkpoint near Najaf on Saturday, in which four soldiers were killed, Iraqi leaders said more such bombings would follow. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said thousands of Arab volunteers ready for martyrdom have been coming to Iraq _ raising the possibility that a prolonged stay of foreign forces could turn the country into a magnet for a Muslim jihad, or holy war. The context in Iraq is different from here, because the United States has no claim to Iraqi territory, whereas many Israelis lay claim to the West Bank and Gaza and Israel has established some 150 settlements in the areas. Also, Saddam's regime is secular, whereas most Palestinian suicide bombers have come from Islamic fundamentalist groups. Still, secular Palestinian groups have increasingly carried out such attacks as well, and Saddam could probably rally considerable Islamic support if the war drags on. In any case, Israeli counterterrorism experts say U.S. and British troops will have little choice but to copy some of the Israeli methods in response to the new threat _ and could suffer some of the same consequences. Military analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily that Israel has already shared with the United States some of the ``experience that has been accumulated here in terms of dealing with suicide bombers and targeted killings.'' Ziad Abu Amr, a Palestinian legislator, noted that Israel's crackdown has often been counterproductive, with curfews, travel bans and raids fueling Palestinian resentment of Israel and widening the circle of potential bombers. Israel's checkpoint system in the West Bank is the point of greatest friction between Israeli authorities and Palestinian civilians, who often complain about being humiliated or mistreated by soldiers. After Saturday's attack in Najaf, U.S. and British troops already appeared to be more thorough in frisking Iraqis who approached them. Saturday's bombing ``was deliberately designed to make American soldiers more nervous about Iraqi citizens,'' said Eran Lehrman, a former Israeli intelligence official. ``This is part of an attempt to destroy the hearts and minds campaign.'' The Najaf bombing should give the Americans a hint of what Saddam has in store for them once they set up their ``occupation government'' in Baghdad, commentator Hemi Shalev wrote in the Maariv daily Monday. The bombings could continue _ and on a much larger scale _ once headquarters are set up in cities, Lehrman said, noting that in Beirut in 1983, a bomber killed 241 U.S. Marines when he drove through their barracks with an explosives-laden truck. Such a rash of suicide attacks could force U.S. and British troops to devote much of their energy to preventing them, a difficult and time-consuming task that could drag out the war and broaden it to much of the population, the analysts said. ``The suicide attack is a type of smart bomb,'' said Boaz Ganor, an Israeli counterterrorism expert. ``It allows the person ... to decide on the time and place of the attack in order to choose the number of people he hurts.'' Lehrman said it could take weeks for the allied forces to start setting up a network of spies who will tip them off to planned attacks and finger militants. In hunting down _ and sometimes killing _ suspects, Israel relies heavily on informers. ``There are no shortcuts,'' he said. ``Intelligence is the key here and it will remain the key.''
