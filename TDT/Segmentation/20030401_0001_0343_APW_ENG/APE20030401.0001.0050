Tokyo stocks edged higher Tuesday after losing more than 3 percent the day before over fears a prolonged war in Iraq could hurt Japan's fragile economy. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to end trading at 7,986.72. On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. It lost 27.7 percent of its value over fiscal 2002, which ended Monday. The dollar bought 118.36 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), down 0.66 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above the 118.14 yen in late New York trading overnight. On the stock market, the Nikkei index was lifted by buying in select blue chips, including Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and NTT DoCoMo. The market as a whole, however, remained subdued as investors were discouraged by Wall Street's sharp drop overnight amid growing pessimism over the prospects of the Iraq war. The market shrugged off North Korea's test firing of a ground-to-ship missile Tuesday morning, traders said. A central bank survey released Tuesday showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers worsened in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling stock prices and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average closed out Monday's trading down 153.64 points, or 1.9 percent, at 7,992.13. The Nasdaq sank 28.43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,341.17. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index closed up 0.96 points, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. The TOPIX, which includes all first-section issues, closed down 29.92 points, or 3.66 percent, Monday. In currencies, the dollar was pressured by war worries. The euro bought US$1.0887 Tuesday afternoon in Tokyo, up from US$1.0874 late Monday. Against the yen, the euro traded at 128.93 yen, down from 129.40 yen. The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond slipped to 0.6900 percent from 0.7000 percent late Monday. Its price rose 0.09 to 101.02. Government bonds have benefited from investor anxieties. Protracted pessimism about the Japanese economy has prompted consumers to place their money in what they consider a safer investment. _ _ _ On the Net: Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange: http://www.tse.or.jpx
