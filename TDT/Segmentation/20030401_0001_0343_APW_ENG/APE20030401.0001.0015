Human rights activists and judicial officials in Guatemala face ``deliberate and systematic'' intimidation while women, children and minorities are ignored and abused, a U.S. report said Monday. The State Department's annual report on human rights in this Central American country echoed the warnings of a similar report released Saturday by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. ``The biggest concern was the increase in attacks against human rights activists in 2002,'' said a U.S. Embassy news release summarizing the report. ``The number and pattern of these attacks point to a deliberate and systematic effort to intimidate'' the activists, the statement said, adding that some of the offensive action could be traced to clandestine groups connected to the government. The report also blamed government security forces for arbitrary arrests and torture and criticized the government's offer to pay the ex-paramilitaries it recruited during the country's 36-year civil war, calling it ``an insult to the victims.'' More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, died during the war, which ended in 1996. The government agreed this month to pay ex-paramilitary members US$660 each in three installments _ one this year, and two next year. But the ex-paramilitaries want US$2,500 handed over in one payment. Hundreds of the former paramilitary members blocked highways and attacked an oil pipeline Monday to push their demands. The State Department report also said that women, children, Indians and those with disabilities continued to suffer abuse and neglect, while only ``limited steps'' had been taken to help them as promised in the peace accords signed at the end of the war. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission report released Saturday concluded that human rights and democracy are threatened in Guatemala due to widespread corruption, ongoing threats against human rights activists, and neglect of the country's most vulnerable citizens, especially children.
