Unidentified assailants fired rockets at two U.S. bases in Afghanistan and an American Humvee vehicle struck an anti-tank mine, but no casualties were reported in any of the incidents, the U.S. military said Tuesday. The armored Humvee struck the mine late Monday near the southern city of Kandahar, the U.S. military said in a statement from its headquarters at Bagram Air Base, north of the capital. ``No one was injured, but the vehicle sustained extensive damage to the front end. A military police patrol and an explosive ordnance disposal unit responded to the scene,'' the statement said. ``A second TC6 anti-tank mine with detonation cord was found and destroyed in place. The Humvee was towed back to base.'' It was unclear who laid the mines. Northeast of Kandahar, two rockets were fired at an American forces base. Later on Monday, another rocket was fired toward a U.S. base at Orgun in the eastern province of Paktika. None of the rockets hit any American facilities. Rockets, many Chinese-made and connected to crude water timers, have been fired frequently at coalition forces based in southern and eastern Afghanistan. The rockets, sometimes leaned against rocks, are difficult to aim and have rarely caused casualties. Thousands of U.S. and coalition troops are in Afghanistan hunting down Taliban holdouts and remnants of the al-Qaida terror network.
