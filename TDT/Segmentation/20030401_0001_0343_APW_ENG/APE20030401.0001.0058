Well-wishers bid ``happy trails'' to the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum, which is moving to Branson, Missouri, from California. The museum, which closed its doors Sunday, hopes to open in Branson in May. Rogers _ known to Western movie fans as the ``King of the Cowboys'' _ died in 1998 at age 86. Evans, who wrote the couple's theme song, ``Happy Trails to You,'' died in 2001 at 88. ``We've been here 36 years in the high desert, so it's a little bit rough,'' said son Dusty Rogers. He added: ``We took mom to Branson about six years ago and she just loved it. Basically we're fulfilling what she wanted to do.'' Museum attendance _ which had peaked in the 1990s at around 75,000 visitors a year _ had fallen to fewer than 50,000, he said. ^ _ _ _ On the Net: Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Web site: http://www.royrogers.com/
