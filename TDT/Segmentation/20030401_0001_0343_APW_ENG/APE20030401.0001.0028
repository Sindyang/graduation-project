BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.S. forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southeast, where circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. A massive explosion at 9:30 a.m. shook buildings inside the city. It wasn't immediately known what was hit. A steady series of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday morning _ likely against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the strongest blasts in Baghdad since the U.S.-led air war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. Across the Tigris River, on its east bank, another target was hit in the city center less than a mile (kilometer) from the Palestine Hotel. The foundation of the 18-story hotel, where foreign journalists are staying, shook as if it had been struck by a powerful earthquake. U.S. military officials said allied aircraft bombed a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son Odai runs a torture center. Also Monday night, Odai and Qusai, Saddam's other son, appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing footage of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining when the video was shot. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' defense of the areas, state television said. A communique read on Iraqi Satellite Television said members of the 11th Division, which fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families would immediately receive 2 million dinars _ about US$670 at the exchange rate on the eve of the war. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, according to Al-Arabiya television. U.S. attempts to silence Iraqi TV and radio and halt propaganda through aerial attacks have failed, with Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf insisting the broadcasts were unaffected. Despite repeated bombings of the Iraqi Information Ministry and Iraqi transmitters, the local media operation was ``as good as it was before'' the attacks, al-Sahhaf said. Iraqi television was off for about three hours Monday morning before broadcasts resumed. In Qatar, Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks of U.S. Central Command said Monday that damage to the transmission facilities meant the civilian population ``did not see much of the regime at this time.'' Al-Sahhaf condemned the Americans and the British as ``saboteurs of the first rate who deserve nothing less than death.'' He also claimed that Iraqi fighters had killed 43 coalition soldiers Sunday. The official death count released by the United States and Britain was 70 since the war began. ``They deny and spread lies'' about their casualties, Al-Sahhaf said. Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, meeting with reporters at the Palestine Hotel, warned that only surrender could save coalition troops from a ``holocaust.'' ``Every day that passes the United States and Britain are sinking deeper in the mud of defeat,'' Sabri said. ``Those two states have no choice but to withdraw early and fast, today before tomorrow.'' Nearly all of Baghdad's telephone lines appeared out in the city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were struck. But the city's power supply remains intact and street lights came on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad, to try to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital.
