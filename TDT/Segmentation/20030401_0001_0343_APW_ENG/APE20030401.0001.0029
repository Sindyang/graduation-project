An opposition Congress party worker and at least four suspected Islamic militants were killed in India's portion of disputed Kashmir on Tuesday, police said. Suspected guerrillas barged into the village home of Congress party member Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, shooting and killing him, said a police officer on condition of anonymity. The attack took place in Kreeri, a village 45 kilometers (30 miles) north of Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir. Separately, a suspected militant was killed in a five-hour gunbattle between paramilitary soldiers and suspected rebels hiding in a house in Kapran, a village 55 kilometers (35 miles) south of Srinagar, the officer said. In nearby Kulgam village, three suspected militants were killed in another gunbattle with Indian soldiers, police said. More than a dozen groups of Islamic militants have been fighting for Muslim majority Kashmir's independence from predominantly Hindu India, or its merger with Islamic Pakistan, since 1989. At least 61,000 people have been killed in the conflict. India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the rebel groups, a charge Islamabad denies. The two countries have fought two wars over control of Kashmir. Both countries claim the entire Himalayan territory, which is divided between the two by a cease-fire line.
