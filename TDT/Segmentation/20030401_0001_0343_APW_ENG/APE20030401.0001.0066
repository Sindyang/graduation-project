In response to the war in Iraq, an advisory council to the governor of Russia's Primorye region denounced American movies as propaganda of U.S. global domination, the regional administration said Tuesday. The Council for Information Security discussed how to counter the alleged American propaganda at a session late last week, the administration said in a statement. The session was ordered by Governor Sergei Darkin, who was alarmed that most television stations in his region were showing more and more American movies. At a time when Russia is voicing vehement opposition to the U.S.-led war, American movies ``advocate the cult of force, show the invincibility of the American army and directly impose on viewers the postulates that the United States has the right to decide the future of the world,'' the administration said. ``Showing American films today is not as inoffensive as it may seem at first glance,'' it said. ``As a matter of fact, it is playing into the hands of the American ideological machine.'' The council said that more than 60 percent of television shows and films broadcast in the Primorye region, on Russia's Pacific coast, are made in the United States or under U.S. license. The advisory body recommended that law enforcement agencies audit local broadcasters to see whether they had bought the rights to the American movies that they show. The move should reduce U.S. content on local airwaves because many television companies use pirated copies of foreign films, the statement said. (am/ji/mb)
