Coalition troops fighting in Iraq are currently ``seen as the villains'' but Iraqis will eventually welcome living in a liberated country, a British government minister said. Home Secretary David Blunkett said he was confident Britain and America would win the conflict and free Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's regime. ``We know that for the moment we will be seen as the villains,'' Blunkett told British Broadcasting Corp. television Monday. ``But once this is over and there is a free Iraq, with a democratic state ... the population as a whole will say that we want a free country, we want a state to live in where we can use our talents to the full.'' Britain has 45,000 personnel, including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led war on Iraq. Britain's Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed Monday in southern Iraq while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing the British death toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry said the soldier's family had been informed, but gave no further information. According to a Populus poll published in The Times newspaper Tuesday, 78 percent of respondents think the coalition should ``strike only targets where there is little or no risk of Iraqi civilians being killed, even if this means the war lasts longer.'' Sixteen percent said the coalition should strike any target that helps to win the war, regardless of the risk to civilians. Sixty-five percent of respondents thought the war was going well, compared with 28 percent who believed it was going badly. Successive opinion polls showed a majority of the British public opposed a war without U.N. backing and Prime Minister Tony Blair took a major political gamble in committing British troops to military action. But public opinion has shown signs of swinging round now war has started and polls have shown growing support for force to disarm Iraq. According to the Populus survey, 60 percent of respondents thought Blair had done a good job handling the Iraq crisis, compared with 37 percent who thought he had performed badly. According to an ICM poll published in The Guardian newspaper Tuesday, 52 percent of respondents support the war, compared with 34 percent who are opposed to the conflict. Fourteen percent were undecided. Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults between March 28-30. ICM interviewed 1,003 adults by telephone between March 28-30. The margin of error in both polls was plus or minus three percentage points. (ej)
