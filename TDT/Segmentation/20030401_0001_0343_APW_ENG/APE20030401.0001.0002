An American warplane veered off the USS Constellation's flight deck and slipped into the water during landing Tuesday. The two pilots ejected and were rescued by helicopter in the Persian Gulf. The S-3B Viking airplane, which is generally used for anti-submarine warfare, malfunctioned, military officials said in a statement. After being rescued, both pilots were able to walk off the helicopter, although one was carried away on a stretcher. Both were being evaluated for minor injuries, officials said. Their names were not released.
