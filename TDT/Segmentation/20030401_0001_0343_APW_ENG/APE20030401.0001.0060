PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ AOL Time Warner Inc. has completed its restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment, paying Comcast Corp. $3.6 billion in stock and cash for full control of assets including Warner Bros. and Home Box Office. The deal finished Monday gives Comcast cash to help trim debt after its November acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband, which made Comcast the largest U.S. cable television operator. It allows AOL Time Warner to regain control of entertainment assets including Time Warner Entertainment's interests in the WB Network, Comedy Central and Court TV. Time Warner and AT&amp;T had been partners in the venture before Comcast's acquisition of AT&amp;T Broadband. AOL Time Warner chief executive Dick Parsons had sought to free his company from the complicated TWE deal. ``The successful completion of the TWE restructuring is another milestone in our efforts to simplify the structure of our company and maximize our operating flexibility, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet,'' Parsons said in a statement. Comcast received $2.1 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in AOL Time Warner stock to complete the deal. AOL Time Warner gained a 79 percent stake, while Comcast retains a 21 percent stake in a new subsidiary called Time Warner Cable Inc., the companies said. Completion of the restructuring clears the way for an initial public offering of Time Warner Cable this summer, which is designed to shore up the company's finances. Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts said when Comcast acquired AT&amp;T Broadband that the $3.6 billion would be a vital part of plans to reduce $30 billion in debt to $25 billion within 18 months. The companies announced the deal's conclusion after markets closed Monday. AOL Time Warner's stock closed at $10.86 a share, down 49 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Comcast's Class A shares fell 68 cents to close at $28.59 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
