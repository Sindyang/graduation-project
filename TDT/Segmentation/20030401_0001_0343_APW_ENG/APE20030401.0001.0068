Singapore authorities, hoping to stop the spread of a deadly flu-like virus, will quarantine the men's and women's rugby teams for at least a week after they returned from the Hong Kong Sevens tournament. The 26 players were checked upon arrival in Singapore and sent home for a weeklong quarantine, although they were all found clear of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, said team spokeswoman Rose Tan. SARS has killed four people and sickened at least 90 in this city-state of 4 million. The government has closed schools for a week and placed more than 1,500 people under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days in a bid to stop the spread of the disease. Hong Kong has recorded 610 SARS cases and 15 deaths, out of a global total of more than 1,600 infections and about 60 deaths. Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang had earlier described the association's decision to compete in the tournament as ``unwise.'' Singapore's Straits Times newspaper said the rugby association would compensate the players, all nonprofessionals, for missing work during their quarantine. Tan said the Singapore Sevens rugby tournament, scheduled for Apr 26-27, will go ahead as planned. The Singapore Sevens, like the Hong Kong tournament, is part of the World Sevens Series circuit.
