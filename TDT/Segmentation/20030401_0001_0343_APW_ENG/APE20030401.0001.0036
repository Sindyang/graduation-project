Cuban authorities were negotiating earlyTuesday at Havana's airport with a man who claimed to be armed with two grenades on a plane with 46 other people aboard after he unsuccessfully tried to hijack it to the United States. Authorities said the plane was forced to land in Havana because of insufficient fuel after it was hijacked on a regular flight to the Cuban capital from the small Isle of Youth late Monday. At 1 a.m. EDT (0600 GMT), the twin-engine plane remain parked on the tarmac on a remote runway as negotiations continued. It would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily guarded by the military. A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with grenades. On March 19, another plane flying the same route was successfully hijacked to the United States. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement, distributed to international reporters here. In the statement, Cuban authorities blamed the hijacking attempt on what they called the lax treatment that six other suspected hijackers received after successfully forcing a passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, on March 19. In the earlier hijacking, knife-wielding hijackers took control of a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 with six crew members and 25 passengers as it descended toward Havana after a trip from the Isle of Youth. Cuban authorities later reported that the plane barely had enough fuel to reach American soil. The suspected hijackers were charged by U.S. authorities with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years in federal prison. They were later granted bond but have not been able to post it, so they are still jailed. ``The entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. The earlier hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched and American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West.
