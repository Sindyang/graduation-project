Cuban authorities were negotiating early Tuesday at Havana's airport with a man who claimed to be armed with two grenades on a plane with 46 other people aboard after he unsuccessfully tried to hijack it to the United States. Authorities said the plane was forced to land in Havana because of insufficient fuel after it was hijacked on a regular flight to the Cuban capital from the small Isle of Youth late Monday. A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with grenades. On March 19, another plane flying the same route was successfully hijacked to the United States. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement, distributed to international reporters here. The statement blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana says is the lax treatment that six other suspected hijackers received after successfully forcing a passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at knifepoint on March 19. The suspected hijackers in the earlier incident were charged by U.S. authorities with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years in prison. They were granted bond, but remain behind bars because they have been unable to come up with the money. ``The entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. Six crew members and 25 passengers were on the twin-engine Douglas DC-3 when knife-wielding hijackers took control of the plane as it descended toward Havana after a flight from the Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key West. Cuban authorities later reported that the plane barely had enough fuel to reach American soil. The earlier hijacking occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched. American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West.
