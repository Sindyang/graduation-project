The president of the tiny Pacific island of Nauru had a heart attack and was hospitalized just weeks after his predecessor died in a U.S. hospital, an Australian government spokeswoman said Tuesday. Derog Gioura, 71, was in an Australian hospital and was expected to survive, the Australian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. Gioura was appointed Nauru's acting president after incumbent leader Bernard Dowiyogo, a diabetic for 30 years, died in Washington last month after an 11-hour heart operation. The spokeswoman said said Gioura was still acting president because Parliament had already dissolved and elections would take place in May, leaving the current political climate unchanged. Nauru, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, has a population of about 12,300 people living on an island of 20.5 square kilometers (8 square miles). It is almost totally dependent on Australian aid and commerce for its economic survival. Gioura's appointment was the latest chapter in a series of political upheavals that has plagued Nauru for more than 20 years. Dowiyogo had been Nauru's president six times since he was first elected in 1976.
