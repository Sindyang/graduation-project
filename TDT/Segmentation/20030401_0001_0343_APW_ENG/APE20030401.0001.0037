Two rusty, jagged-edged beams salvaged from the ruins of the World Trade Center were joined together in the new bell tower of a Roman Catholic church. ``To have the two steel beams here ... is a sign of new life coming from the tragedy of the World Trade Center,'' said Archbishop Michael Sheehan, who toured the bell tower near the Rio Grande on Monday. One 30-foot-long (nine-meter-long) beam was set horizontally on a corner of the church and extends into a chapel where people will be able touch it. The other beam, 20 feet (six meters) long and sheared off at a sharp angle, is set vertically in concrete. Both beams are rusted and discolored, possibly from the intense heat of the fire. Plans call for a large, glassed-in entry area to be built so they can always be seen, even when the church is closed. Architect Isaac Benton said the raising of the 50-foot (15-meter) tower Monday marked the final step in converting a school gymnasium into a church. The parish's old church was demolished in the mid-1970s because of structural deterioration.
