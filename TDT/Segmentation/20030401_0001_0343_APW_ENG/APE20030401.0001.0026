The U.S. Army has suspended a Hungarian-based program that sought to train Iraqi dissidents for non-combat roles in the war, military officials said. It did not say why the program was suspended or how many dissidents had participated. But local media reported that about 80 volunteers had completed training at the Taszar base in southern Hungary, dubbed ``Camp Freedom.'' The Iraqis were trained in two groups _ the first group finishing in February, the second on Friday. Maj. Gen. David Barno, the Training Task Force commander, said in a statement that the Iraqi volunteers already deployed were making ``invaluable contributions'' to coalition efforts. Barno said the first group of volunteers was in the Gulf region helping coalition civil affairs units deliver humanitarian aid through the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. The second group also would be sent to the region, he said. The Army recruited the volunteers from Iraqi opposition groups around the world, although most had been living in the United States. They represent the major Iraqi ethnic and religious groups, including Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. The Hungarian government had authorized the United States to bring 1,500 trainers and up to 3,000 Iraqis for non-combat training sessions to Taszar, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of Budapest. A spokesman for the Hungarian government, J. Zoltan Gal, told the state-run news agency MTI that the end of the training program in Taszar increased Hungary's security and essentially put an end to Hungary's contribution to the war effort. Last week, the main opposition party asked the government to withdraw Hungary's name from a list of countries supporting the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Recent polls indicate that at least 70 percent of Hungarians oppose the war. The U.S. military has used Taszar since December 1995, when it transformed the Hungarian military base into a logistics post for NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia.
