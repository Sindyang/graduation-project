Chinese authorities are recommending that doctors isolate patients suspected of having severe acute respiratory syndrome, disinfect anything patients touch and wear face masks during treatment, according to guidelines available Tuesday on the top disease-control agency's Web site. The recommendations, issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, came after days of criticism of the country's communist government for its sluggish approach to the new illness, known as SARS. ``Hospitals must attach great importance to isolation work and disinfection,'' the government's guidelines say. Beijing-based officials from the World Health Organization said they were given the guidelines late Monday, but an official at the center who gave his name only as Mr. Zhou said they were posted Friday. More than 1,600 people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and 62 have died. Chinese officials last week acknowledged at least 34 deaths from the illness _ 31 of them in the southern province of Guangdong, where the disease is believed to have originated. Chinese officials have released little public information about the malady and have yet to begin providing daily updates on the disease as promised to WHO investigators who arrived in Beijing over a week ago. A WHO spokesman said Tuesday that investigators were also still awaiting permission to visit Guangdong where they hope to find clues into the disease's origin and spread. ``The Chinese government has not covered up. There is no need,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Tuesday. ``We have nothing to hide.'' Barely an hour later, a CNN satellite feed to an apartment compound housing foreigners in Beijing went black during a report on the illness _ something that has happened in the past when the news network reports about the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or other stories that make the communist government uneasy. The 17 pages of detailed guidelines posted on the disease agency's Web site instruct hospitals to transfer patients suspected of having SARS to designated hospitals that have specialists in infectious diseases, respiratory problems and intensive care. Medical staff who interact with such patients should wear masks with 12 layers of fabric and protective caps, gloves and goggles. Anything patients touch _ including blood-pressure cuffs and ambulance equipment _ should be disinfected, the guidelines say. Hospitals are also told to disinfect the air in hallways, rest rooms, X-ray departments and other public spaces twice a day using spray disinfectant and, in some areas, germ-killing ultraviolet light. Local authorities were also told to improve ``scientific publicity'' to encourage the public to get early diagnosis and treatment, wash hands often and avoid crowded public areas such as cinemas. State-controlled newspapers and broadcasts monitored in Beijing made no mention Tuesday of the sickness. The central government's Health Ministry and local health authorities in Beijing, Guangdong and the northern province of Shanxi, where four cases have been reported, would say nothing. Despite the silence, many Chinese have learned about the disease from foreign broadcasts and the Internet. Pharmacies in Beijing are selling out of surgical masks and report swift sales of herbal remedies often credited with preventing infection. Already, organizers have canceled the women's world ice hockey championships, scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday. The Rolling Stones have also canceled concerts in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing due to concerns over the illness. On Saturday, the U.S. Centers of Diseases Control recommended travelers put off nonessential trips to mainland China. Medical staff at seven Beijing-area hospitals visited on Tuesday were wearing face masks, though hospital officials all either denied seeing SARS cases or refused to talk. Beijing United Family, a joint-venture hospital that serves the expatriate community, said in a posted notice that the hospital was ``closely watching the situation.'' Hospital officials said they have seen no cases of SARS, either at the hospital or within the larger expatriate community. ``We will remain vigilant, taking all necessary precautions,'' Dr. Sarah Borwein, head of the hospital's committee for handling potential SARS cases, said in a written statement. Hospital officials said they had been in frequent contact with government health authorities but refused to discuss details. A number of expatriate schools in Beijing have suspended classes out of concern, though schools in Guangdong's provincial capital of Guangzhou said they were staying open. ``Everyone here is healthy and no one is fearful,'' said a Chinese employee of the American International School of Guangzhou. She gave only her family name, Tang.
