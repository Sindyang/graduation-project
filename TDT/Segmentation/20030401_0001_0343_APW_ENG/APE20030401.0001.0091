Earlier in the day, Japanese officials said North Korea fired a missile from the Korean Peninsula's northwest coast, but said it posed no immediate security threat. ``Since this is not a ballistic missile, we do not think that this would pose a direct threat to the security of Japan,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hatsuhisa Takashima said. He said it appeared to have flown toward the Yellow Sea, and not the Sea of Japan. Japan launch last Friday of two spy satellites angered North Korea, which threatened to test-fire a missile. Tuesday's reported launch added to growing fears in Japan that the reclusive communist state might take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. In Washington, a Pentagon official also confirmed the reported missile launch and said the United States did not view it as a threat. But South Korea's Defense Ministry later said there was no evidence that North Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. South Korea's new government, headed by President Roh Moo-hyun, has made strong efforts to reduce tensions with North Korea. The U.S. military announced Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops currently in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared last October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.
