Hong Kong health officials said Tuesday they may set up quarantine centers in rural areas to house hundreds of people exposed to the deadly flu-like illness that has killed 62 people worldwide. Meanwhile, officials revised downward the number of people believed affected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, from an apartment complex where 240 people were quarantined Monday. Authorities earlier said 213 people from the Amoy Gardens apartments had symptoms of the disease. But Health Department spokeswoman Eva Wong put the number at 185 on Tuesday. Separately, the Health Department said a 30-year-old man with SARS symptoms had flown here from Bangkok aboard Thai Airways Flight TG606, and they wanted to locate all other passengers. The man became sick while he was staying in the Thai capital from March 25 to Saturday, but health officials in Hong Kong said they did not immediately know his nationality or where he contracted his illness. Global health officials say they have been worried by the spread of the illness by air travelers _ which is apparently how it moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada and Vietnam, all of which have suffered deaths. Four recreational activity camps in rural Hong Kong areas could be turned into quarantine centers if the Health Department decides it is necessary, said Gordon Tam, a spokesman for the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The camps could accommodate about 1,000 people. Health Director Dr. Margaret Chan told Amoy Gardens representatives on Tuesday that quarantined residents would be moved to those camps if officials determine that the source of the disease remains in the apartment block, according to lawmaker Fred Li, who took part in the discussion. Hong Kong has recorded 610 cases of SARS and 15 deaths, out of a global total of more than 1,600 infections and about 60 deaths.
