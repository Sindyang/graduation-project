A U.N. food agency will ship flour to northern Iraq through Turkey to feed Iraqi Kurds who fled their houses fearing an attack by Saddam Hussein's forces, a spokeswoman said Tuesday. The World Food Program will send 1,000 metric tons of wheat flour on 60 trucks to northern Iraq on Wednesday from a warehouse in the southeastern city of Gaziantep, said Heather Hill. The agency sent 77 metric tons of powdered milk to the region from Turkey on Saturday. ``We're concerned about food supplies,'' Hill said. ``We want to make sure that people have enough food to eat.'' Thousands of Iraqi Kurdish residents have left cities and frontline towns to move toward the Turkish and Iranian borders, according to Iraqi Kurdish officials. Hill said the food shipments would be distributed near the northern Iraqi cities of Irbil, Dohuk and Sulaymaniyah. The agency has been stockpiling food in countries bordering Iraq to feed 900,000 refugees for 10 weeks. Tons of high-energy biscuits, chickpeas and vegetables oil are ready for shipment from Turkey. The United Nations appealed Friday for US$2.2 billion in emergency aid for war-torn Iraq. The food program would use more than half of that money in the six months after the war to feed most of the country's population. ^ sh-ht/ar
