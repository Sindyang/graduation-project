All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu is expected to be sidelined for at least a month due to a chronic kidney problem. ``Jonah's health is paramount and his doctors have recommended that he take a full break from rugby so that he can receive the appropriate medical treatment,'' said New Zealand Rugby Football Union spokesman Steve Tew. With selection for the New Zealand World Cup squad on the line, his absence has come at a bad time for Lomu, who was voted the player of the 1995 World Cup in South Africa. Doubts about his fitness emerged with a series of disappointing performances that led to him being dropped from the Hurricanes' lineup for a Super 12 clash against the Sharks last month. Lomu was diagnosed as having nephritic syndrome, a rare kidney disorder, at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving regular treatment, including consultations with All Blacks doctor John Mayhew. ``This is a chronic intermittent condition which has fluctuated over the last six or seven years,'' Mayhew was quoted saying by the New Zealand Press Association. ``We are hopeful that the modifications in his treatment will enable him to return to rugby in the near future. We will re-evaluate the situation after four weeks.'' Mayhew said Lomu was ``playing with a serious medical handicap all the time,'' but was a remarkable individual who didn't complain, despite being ``seriously handicapped since 1996.'' All Blacks coach John Mitchell said everyone involved with the team hoped to see Lomu back on the rugby field soon. (jp)
