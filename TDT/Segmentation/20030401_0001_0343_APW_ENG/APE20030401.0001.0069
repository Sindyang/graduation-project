Communist rebels evacuated a small train station, then blew it up early Tuesday in eastern Bihar state, said a railway official. There were no injuries, but extensive damage was caused to the building, the rail track and the communication system at Nadaul, 45 kilometers (30 miles) south of Patna, the state capital, said assistant railway divisional manager A.K. Verma. He said traffic had been halted on the line between Patna and Gaya, the site of major Buddhist temples. Verma said militants of the People's War Group evacuated staff from the Nadaul station before setting off the explosion. The group, along with another outlawed rebel outfit, the Maoist Communist Center, had called for a statewide dawn to dusk strike in Bihar on Tuesday to protest police brutality and the U.S.-led war in Iraq.
