The Tamil Tiger rebels have denied attacking a Sri Lankan vessel carrying government troops, one of the European monitors overseeing the cease-fire between the government and rebels said Tuesday. ``The LTT (Tamil Tigers) say they had nothing to do with the incident,'' said Hagrup Haukland, deputy head of the Norwegian-led monitoring team. He said a monitor sent to the scene of Monday's skirmish has yet to submit his report on the incident. Four soldiers were injured when a suspected Tamil Tiger rebel boat fired at the 100-meter (330-foot) Lanka Muditha, which was carrying more than 1,200 soldiers from the eastern city of Trincomalee to Jaffna, a former rebel stronghold in the north. The vessel returned fire, capsizing and sinking the suspected rebel boat, said navy spokesman Jayantha Perera. ``There might have been between four to six Tigers on the boat,'' Perera said. Haukland said the rebels' sea force commander, Soosai, had denied any involvement in the incident or knowledge of it. Soosai, like many rebels, uses only one name. The Tigers _ who were fighting for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamils _ and the government declared a truce in February 2002 as part of efforts to end a 19-year civil war. But truce monitors have warned that a recent rise in deadly clashes at sea could hamper continuing peace talks. A March 10 sea battle between the navy and the rebels left 11 guerillas dead. Fifteen Chinese and two Sri Lankans were killed on March 21 when their fishing vessel was attacked. Nine of the boat's crew survived and later said rebels were behind the attack. The rebels denied involvement.
