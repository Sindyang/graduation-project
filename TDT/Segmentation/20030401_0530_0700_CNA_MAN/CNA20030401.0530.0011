World  Health  Organization  (who)  is  through  an  international multi-medicine  research  center  plans  to  speed  up  identifying severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  of  the  disease  causes and  treatment  methods.  At  the  present  time  finding  two  possible causes  disease  virus  vice  Nien  (Paramyxovirus)  and  coronavirus (Coronavirus).  If  the  causes  of  disease,  it  will  be  very rapid  development  of  a  case  management  and  epidemiological investigation  of  diagnostic  tools.  Who  believes  that  there is  no  indication  that  "severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)" biochemical  terror  are  the  results  of  the  war.  The  Seasonal climate  does  not  matter.  Who  regional  advisor  infectious  disease inspection  and,  in  Oshitani  Yan  said  that  once  found  SARS arising  from  the  disease,  may  seek  to  diagnosis  and  treatment. The  Who  Western  Pacific  SARS  Response  Team  Coordination  Officer Valley  Yan  pointed  out  that  the  charges  as  a  result  of the  global  air  travel  in  a  short  period  of  time  the  infectious disease  spread  to  many  countries.  But  if  there  is  a  good protection  measures,  SARs  are  not  highly  infectious  disease, resulting  in  death  rate  is  not  high,  about  10%  condition to  worsen,  the  mortality  rate  to  around  4%  90%  six  to  seven days  patients  can  recover.  He  suggested  that  can  use  of antibiotics,  but  that  does  not  cure,  but  the  second  transmission prevention  to  SARs.  He  noted  that  the  new  diseases  need to  find  the  causes  of  morbidity,  can  there  be  a  medical treatment,  which  depend  on  international  cooperation.  It  is hoped  that  this  process  can  be  accelerated.  At  present,  there are  11  countries  of  the  nine  laboratory  is  a  center  for research  projects.  The  two  may  have  to  find  the  causes  of disease  virus  vice  Nien  (Paramyxovirus)  and  coronavirus  (Coronavirus). Once  poliovirus,  would  soon  develop  case  management  and  epidemiological investigation  of  diagnostic  tools.  He  also  said  that  the Chinese  mainland  has  agreed  to  provide  the  spread  of  SARS information,  but  it  needs  to  be  from  the  mainland  provinces access  to  relevant  information.  The  mainland  is  in  the  process of  establishing  a  system,  from  the  provinces  to  collect  information spread  of  SARS  to  World  Health  Organization.  Who  does  not recommend  to  all  parts  of  the  world  travel.  However,  all travel  should  understand  the  symptoms  of  SARs.  SARS  had  symptoms, and  was  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  the  SARs  have  close contacts  or  travel  to  the  SARS  endemic  areas  should  seek medical  treatment.  The  travel  if  the  symptoms  of  Sars  in rehabilitation  before  not  to  travel.  Oshitani  Yan,  who  is through  global  outbreak  of  diseases  early  warning  and  response Network  (GlobalOutbreak  Alert  and  ResponseNetwork)  partners to  cooperate  in  tracking  the  SARs,  and  coordinated  rapid vectors  found  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  diagnosis  and  treatment.
