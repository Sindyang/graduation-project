World  Trade  Organization  today  also  suffered  major  setbacks. The  145  member  states  in  the  crucial  negotiations  on  agriculture, unable  to  reach  any  consensus  within  the  period,  the  WTO negotiations  on  agriculture  is  one  of  the  most  important items,  the  Doha  round  the  successful  process  forward  is  casting a  shadow  on.  The  council  of  ministers  in  Doha  Declaration, the  WTO  should  be  on  March  31  agreement  before  the  negotiations on  agriculture  model,  but  in  fact,  in  the  28th  had  collapsed. Today's  meeting  in  picking  up  aftermath  and  hope  to  have a  clear  future  to  continue  negotiations.  The  meeting  came a  week,  delegates  have  been  repeating  the  same  old  tune. I  feel  less  than  a  willingness  to  compromise.  The  president of  the  conference  recognized  Amazon  Harbin,  the  meeting  could not  have  any  progress  is  a  "defeat  ",  the  WTO  secretary-general Patrick  Su  guess  also  feel  extremely  disappointed  and  their attitude  also  highlights  the  seriousness  of  agricultural  negotiations fail.  Although  Harbin  less  said  that  today's  setback  is  not everything,  many  countries  have  demonstrated  the  will  and commitment  to  reach  an  agreement.  But  the  differences  in fact,  its  position  that  most  people  do  not  see  June  sub-return to  the  negotiating  table  will  be  the  major  changes.  He  also acknowledged  that  the  reduction  of  tariffs  for  many  of  the key  issues  such  as  the  Council  of  Ministers  in  September, could  only  be  resolved.  In  other  words,  than  the  original agenda  to  be  postponed  at  least  six  months.  WTO  member  states once  again  this  week  to  return  to  the  negotiating  table in  the  hope  that  a  week's  meeting  of  the  Harbin  less  "negotiations on  agriculture  revised  edition  model"  consensus-building  element, but  they  are  not  on  market  access,  cut  export  subsidies and  support  in  the  three  pillars  subject  to  technical  problems have  major  differences,  more  importantly,  there  is  no  initiative member  states  are  willing  to  compromise,  and  concessions. Harbin  has  thus  become  less  critical  of  the  main  target, which  he  is  to  be  calm.  He  said  that  in  this  going  south by  driving  the  chariot  north  for  the  draft  naturally  become the  target  of  public  criticism,  he  is  the  greatest  feeling not  to  be  elected  president.  Taiwan  delegation  owners  can we  talk,  the  Council  of  Agriculture  international  cooperation Commissioner  Wang  Minglai  said  that  although  has  been  expected that  negotiations  will  not  be  successful,  would  be  unlikely to  be  progress,  but  member  states  to  such  an  outcome  or regret.  Taiwan  to  the  negotiations  in  the  patterns  of  tariff concessions,  mainly  concerned  with  issues  such  as  tariff  quotas, have  made  it  clear  that  they  could  not  accept  the  position. Wang  Ming  in  this  week's  meeting  was  also  repeatedly  said that  if  the  "ambitious  model"  was  adopted,  small-scale  farmers and  many  member  states  will  henceforth  agricultural  sustainable development.  He  was  at  the  end  of  the  meeting  today  in his  statement  and  reiterated  the  position  of  Taiwan,  stressing that  Taiwan  supported  the  objectives  of  agricultural  trade liberalization,  but  the  practice  should  be  flexible  in  a gradual  manner.  Wang  Ming  also  thanked  Harbin  less  to  accept new  member  states  should  have  a  longer  period  to  adapt  the position.
