"severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)"  continued  unchecked, 31  buildings  in  the  early  morning  authorities  were  forced to  a  building  housing  the  quarantine  measures,  showing  that the  problem  worsened.  In  this  regard,  some  local  public  opinion, although  the  incident  has  damaged  the  economy  of  Hong  Kong and  Hong  Kong  people  are  worried,  in  particular  has  not had  the  privilege  emotional  mass  panic  and  confusion.  The attack  against  the  SARS  around  January  10  was  the  first outbreak  in  Prince  of  Wales  Hospital,  when  a  large  hospital collective  health  care  workers  infected.  After  the  incident, most  public  opinion  that  the  incident  broke  out  in  Guangdong Province  before  the  recent  outbreak.  At  the  very  beginning, authorities  also  believe  that  the  people's  livelihood  community spread  HIV  is  not  only  focus  on  Wei  8  a  court  room  and then  focus  on  the  hospital  later,  the  No.  8  and  closed a  room.  But  a  few  days  later,  sporadic  virus  began  in  the community,  including  some  air  travel  to  Beijing  after  Hong Kong  returned  to  Hong  Kong  visitors  also  confirmed  infected. The  authorities  to  track  down  the  results  of  the  community with  almost  every  case  Wei  8  a  court  room,  for  most  patients the  ward  to  visit  sick  relatives  and  friends.  The  authorities also  believe  that  HIV  has  yet  to  community-proliferation, three  days  Qian  Jiulong  Amoy  garden  many  residents  were  confirmed HIV  infections.  The  30,  500  Yu  Zong  infection  cases,  213 were  from  Amoy  gardens,  which  is  to  block  E  107  cases  is the  most  severe.  To  this  end,  the  administration  announced at  six  in  the  morning  on  31  separate  blocks  E  10  days, until  April  9.  During  building  prohibit  access  to  all  residents of  the  Diet  and  house-to-house  by  the  authorities.  Date  from isolation  and  the  dispatch  of  a  large  number  medical  personnel, police  officers  and  other  staff  at  the  scene,  including  for disinfection  and  tracing  virus  sources.  Secretary  for  Health, Welfare  and  food  Yang  Yongqiang,  the  follow-up,  with  the virus  PWH,  since  one  block  E  residents  have  repeatedly  visited the  hospital  to  the  families  of  sick,  I  believe  that  by the  virus  is  spreading.  But  the  authorities  headache,  why HIV  is  spreading  fast,  and  the  most  affected  households  living in  the  same  direction.  When  Yang  Yongqiang  SARS  was  asked about  the  possible  spread  through  the  air,  has  also  begun to  show  a  hesitated,  claimed  that  they  would  not  exclude the  possibility  to  abandon  its  earlier  position  maintained by  the  virus  from  respiratory  droplets  spread.  Calculated from  the  10th  of  this  month  to  31  pm,  the  SARS  infected cases  have  been  610  cases,  the  death  toll  increases  to  15 the  spread  of  the  virus  is  not  the  so-called  slow  pace is  cause  for  concern.  Some  recent  public  opinion  pointed out  that  although  the  virus  in  the  event  which  was  unprecedented and  very  worrying  and  some  panic  but  the  most  important is  that  the  government  and  all  Hong  Kong  people  calmly  dealt with  it,  they  are  not  overly  panic  and  chaos,  so  as  not to  throw  ourselves  into  confusion.  In  fact,  the  crisis  so far,  although  Hong  Kong  people  apparently  fear  that  with the  virus,  but  not  for  confusion  and  even  rare  unanimous support  to  the  government  to  contain  the  virus.  Last  week the  government  announced  a  curb  SARS  measures,  including  eight major  political  parties  against  the  government  has  always been  very  few  in  the  Democratic  Party  and  Front-line  stand on  the  same  front.  In  addition,  they  unanimously  support the  government's  blockade  block  E,  and  not  as  happy  as  the previous  government  to  look  for  trouble.  To  this  end,  the Chief  Executive  Tung  Chee-hwa  31  SARS  evening  on  the  latest situation  in  more  than  worried  that  it  is  particularly  grateful to  all  the  people  in  this  incident  government  measures  to support  and  assistance.  The  opinion  that  the  government  as soon  as  possible  to  contain  virus  spread  further  to  the community.  Otherwise,  once  Cases  Surge  in  curbing  public  panic about  the  mood  in  mind,  I  am  afraid  would  eventually  broke out.
