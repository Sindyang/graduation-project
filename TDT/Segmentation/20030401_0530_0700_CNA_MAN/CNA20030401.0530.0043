once  again  to  the  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell's  visit, the  Turkish  government  and  the  military  full  of  hope  and expectation  that  aircraft  could  not  be  lost  if  the  United States  once  again  the  US  military  presence,  Turkey  would definitely  take  into  account,  but  previous  commitments  in the  hope  that  the  United  States  paid  huge  amounts  of  compensation, as  well  as  agreed  with  the  Turkish  military  presence  in northern  Iraq.  At  the  Department  of  State  Colin  Powell  speaking at  a  press  conference  yesterday  in  this  (a)  day  visit  to Belgium  on  the  way  after  visits  to  Turkey  on  Iraq's  war with  the  Turkish  government  high-level  talks,  but  mainly  in northern  Iraq  to  Turkey  on  Kurdish  issues,  and  American-Turkish cooperation  between  the  two  sides  on  this  issue.  According to  the  Turkish  foreign  ministry  officials  said  that  Powell is  scheduled  for  around  11  pm  tonight  arrived  in  Ankara, is  scheduled  for  tomorrow  (2)  left  at  4  pm,  during  his stay,  will  meet  with  Turkish  President  AIDS  Zhai,  prime  minister and  senior  military  officer,  chief  of  staff  Eauze  Cook.  The State  Department  official  said  that  Powell's  visit  to  Ankara had  no  particular  "with  the  intention"  to  the  improvement of  bilateral  relations,  thanks  to  US  warplanes  crossing  Turkish airspace  and  called  on  Turkey  to  agree  to  an  emergency  landing at  US  warplanes  to  bases  in  Turkey,  mainly  in  northern  Iraq reiterated  that  the  United  States  in  the  position  that  against Turkey  into  northern  Iraq  in  order  to  avoid  local  Kurdish conflict,  thereby  affecting  the  US  war  in  Iraq.  But  the Turkish  government,  Powell  to  visit  Iraq  war  war  abroad  visit the  United  States  since  the  first  high-ranking  officials, but  the  Turkish  parliament  on  March  1  to  reject  the  US military  presence  has  resulted  in  poor  relations  between  the two  sides,  has  offered  to  visit  Turkey,  which  must  be  an extraordinary  significance,  and  her  full  of  hope  and  expectation, it  was  imperative  for  Powell  to  visit  the  real  motives. According  to  Ankara  observers  indicated  that  that  Powell's visit  to  northern  Iraq,  in  other  words,  with  the  United States  is  anxious  to  open  in  the  northern  front  Ikita  fundamental relationship  because  the  US  war  in  southern  Iraq  is  not easy,  while  in  the  north  also  lack  heavy  weapons  and  equipment, while  last  week  in  northern  Iraq  a  thousand  elite  airborne troops,  but  was  unable  to  keep  the  Soviet  Moldova  with  al-Caicoo two  oil  center,  the  Iraqi  armed  forces  to  tackle  difficult problems.  The  United  States  planned  at  least  60,000  ground troops  stationed  in  Turkey,  255  F-65  fighter  planes  and  attack helicopters,  as  a  transit  north  Iraq  to  open  a  second  front, in  southern  Iraq  to  meet  Kuwait's  First  Front,  the  north and  south  Iraq  constitutes  an  attack  from  both  sides  battle formation  Shan  Zong  Tonghai  to  shorten  the  war  time  and reduce  casualties.  Turkish  parliament  has  not  been  expected in  March  to  disagree,  the  first  US  military  presence  and forced  the  US  Army  provisional  change  the  war,  have  also contributed  to  the  current  Iraqi  war  into  a  plastic  state. The  White  House  and  the  Pentagon  has  repeatedly  blamed  Turkey is  the  only  refusal  to  cooperate  in  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty Organization  allies,  Turkey  also  abolished  the  previously  agreed to  pay  war  compensation  fund  and  the  US  $26  billion  lending commitments.  Turkey  has  also  upset  endlessly  for  this  purpose. Although  the  March  20,  the  Turkish  parliament  agreed  with the  United  States  warplanes  transit  to  Iraq,  but  later  the time  and  again  in  the  US  cruise  missile  and  crashed  in southeastern  Turkey,  Turkish  government  has  so  far  has  repeatedly declared  that  the  security  in  the  airspace  closure  against US  warplanes  and  missiles  transit  airspace  in  the  United States  against  Iraq  and  to  combat  increased  much  trouble. Nevertheless,  the  ball  between  the  Turkish  initiative  that would  be  expected  to  visit  Turkey,  and  give  up  the  relationship between  the  two  sides  have  breathe  feebly  angry  note  a  unit, at  least  the  two  sides  have  been  stalled  for  a  long  time for  a  moment  of  diplomatic  activity  in  the  intensive  contacts resumption.  Turkish  Prime  Minister,  AIDS,  high-level  meeting yesterday  in  ruling  party  first  said  Powell  could  bring  new demands,  but  no  matter  what,  Turkey  will  be  taken  into  account. AIDS  is  being  called  back,  in  Brussels  of  the  ruling  party membership  of  the  European  Parliament  members  of  parliament, so  as  to  increase  the  number  of  ruling  party  in  parliament to  pass  any  requests  made  by  the  United  States.  Turkish president  Zhai  yesterday  in  the  presidential  palace,  the  new ambassadors  met  with  Russian  history,  the  Thai  ambassadors present  credentials,  journalists  to  visit,  also  said  that the  Turkish  war  against  Iraq  could  be  any  contribution,  if the  United  States,  Turkey  is  willing  to  consider.  But  the United  States  does  not  at  this  stage.  Powell's  visit  to the  Turkish  military  to  stick  to  the  expectations.  The  Turkish military  has  been  in  Turkey  and  Iraq  deployment  of  several thousand  troops  along  the  border  areas  and  at  least  300 tanks,  closely  followed  developments  in  northern  Iraq,  in particular  whether  the  northern  Kurdish  northern  Iraq  took the  opportunity  to  seize  two  oil  center:  Morocco  and  Caicoo Sool,  and  whether  the  intention  of  establishing  an  independent state.  Turkey  fears  that  northern  Iraqi  Kurdish  state  in the  territory  may  stimulate  its  own  Kurdish  residents  of 20  million  renegade  sentiments.  However,  no  matter  whether it  Kurdish  northern  Iraq  to  seize  oil  stronghold  or  an  independent state  with  the  intention,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  attack Saddam  Kurdish  militia  of  the  United  States  is  strongly  against Turkey  into  northern  Iraq,  on  the  grounds  that  Turkey  into northern  Iraq  is  bound  to  trigger  worries  Kurdish  resistance, thus  causing  bloodshed  conflict  areas,  resulting  in  the  war Iraq  war  and  undermine  the  United  States  enter  and  occupy Iraq's  overall  plan.  Despite  the  fact  that  the  United  States has  repeatedly  promised  not  to  allow  Turkish  Kurdish  militia stronghold  oil  rush  into  northern  Iraq,  there  will  be  Ikita base  in  Germany,  but  the  problem  is  not  to  believe  that Turkey  would  not  usurp  the  Kurds  nor  nation-building  fields. In  other  words,  Turkey  also  do  not  believe  that  the  United States.  According  to  the  Turkish  intelligence  showed  that northern  Iraqi  Kurds  have  chosen  a  post-war  with  al-Caicoo Soviet  presence  in  Moldova,  the  mayor  of  the  city.  Ankara observers  believe  that  that  Powell's  visit  to  Ankara,  Turkish military  will  provide  themselves  with  the  latest  developments in  northern  Iraq  and  asked  the  United  States  to  address the  concerns  of  Turkey,  and  may  require  resumption  of  the earlier  agreement  that  the  United  States  agreed  to  enter Turkey  near  northern  Iraqi  Kurds,  monitor  the  activities  of the  US  might  agree  to  exchange  of  the  Turkish  transit  heavy equipment  to  Iraq.
