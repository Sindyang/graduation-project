An  earlier statement  by  President  Chen  pointed  out  that  today,  I  am very  pleased  at  the  Presidential  Palace  personally  welcome to  the  Cabinet  Committee  on  Aboriginal  people  organized  by the  "aboriginal  peoples  impression  brigade"  Exhibition  Opens in  the  hope  that  through  the  media's  interest  to  attract more  people  to  visit  the  exhibition  of  great  significance. He  said  that  since  the  Public  Service,  there  have  always hoped  for  Aboriginal  people  for  more  care  and  services,  which is  not  only  because  aboriginal  peoples  in  today's  society is  a  small  and  weak,  and  aboriginal  peoples  as  well  as the  fact  that  Taiwan  is  the  first  masters  of  the  land, as  well  as  the  richest  source  of  Taiwan's  Cultural  and  artistic treasures.  President  Chen  stressed  that  over  the  past  because the  error  of  perspective  and  with  the  many  historical  and political  factors  accelerating  wrongly  believe  that  the  aboriginal peoples  assimilation  and  Chinese  localization  is  their  best to  help  aboriginal  peoples  caused  the  collapse  of  the  structures of  society  and  culture  faults  and  the  loss  of  their  mother tongue,  causing  aboriginal  peoples  ethnic  identity  and  economic life  is  not  all,  this  is  what  the  government,  not  even a  deep  reflection  on  the  Taiwan  society  to  work  together to  place.  The  indigenous  people,  the  president  said  that he  has  many  indigenous  people,  are  frequently  invited  to guest,  indigenous  people  feel  the  warmth  and  hospitality, we  always  get  the  best  thing  to  entertain  guests.  It  is easy  to  see  all  the  pristine  national  character,  there  is really  the  sincerity  and  goodwill  of  the  warmth,  so  natural. He  constantly  remind  ourselves  that  in  order  to  cherish  all the  land  in  Taiwan,  we  must  help  aboriginal  peoples  back to  the  historical  memory  loss,  as  well  as  major  human  dignity, on  the  fault  lines  and  ambiguous  or  marginalized,  we  must make  the  greatest  possible  to  restore  the  original  look. President  Chen  Shui-bian  said  that  Taiwan  is  a  multi-ethnic state,  not  only  a  Han  nationality.  Taiwan's  great  and  beautiful, but  also  to  have  a  very  inclusive.  Therefore,  whether  aboriginal peoples,  Taiwanese  and  mainland  ethnic  Hakka  or  should  be opened  in  the  heart  of  the  fence,  abandon  their  original ethnic  prejudice  and  suspicion,  they  take  shelter  in  Taiwan this  piece  of  land  a  life  together,  sharing,  coexistence and  common  prosperity.  When  the  Taiwan  rapidly  taken  significant strides  forward,  we  are  also  to  keep  back  to  indigenous ethnology,  study  and  learn  to  respect  nature  and  learn  to care  for  land,  more  importantly,  learn  to  respect  and  tolerance of  different  cultures.  This  is  the  21st  Century  "new  Taiwanese" should  have.  In  recent  years,  since  all  the  support  and encouragement,  the  president  said  that  the  government  continued to  seek  opportunities  for  indigenous  people  hope  to  do  more. For  example:  the  presidential  palace  in  front  of  the  Chieh-shou road  would  be  renamed  Al-Qaeda  cells  Lan  Dadao,  because  Ketagalan is  Taipei's  first  aboriginal  peoples  and  in  Taiwan  art  history, organized  the  first  aboriginal  peoples  of  the  art  exhibits and  recognition  of  Taiwan  art  forms  from  the  indigenous  peoples and  the  arts,  construction  planning  aboriginal  peoples  theme park,  selected  in  the  Palace  Museum  side,  we  must  remind everyone  to  understand  Chinese  culture,  also  not  forget  that Taiwan's  prehistoric  culture.  President  Chen  Shui-bian  said that  the  government  also  assisted  for  aboriginal  peoples' intellectual  property  rights,  and  in  the  official  boarded the  position  of  international  solidarity;  and  the  National Aboriginal  art  for  the  presidential  guest  to  grant  the  gift, the  Presidential  Office  of  the  interview  room  and  in  particular, the  aboriginal  peoples  totem  for  decoration,  and  even  in the  presidential  inauguration  ceremony  and  the  national  anthem sung  to  Zhang  Hui-mei,  these  efforts,  which  is  to  highlight Aboriginal  peoples  to  enrich  the  cultural  characteristics. Because  of  the  aboriginal  peoples  in  this  beautiful  land, Taiwan  groups  more  diversified,  and  more  rich  and  splendid culture.  Today's  display  very  excellent,  and  the  people  to "aboriginal  peoples  impression  brigade"  as  the  theme,  also has  special  meaning.  President  Chen  expressed  the  hope  that with  the  exhibition,  so  that  we  recognize  that  the  greatest ethnic  groups,  in  the  past  to  reposition  the  impression  of stereotypes  and  believe  that  when  we  have  come  after  the exhibition  gallery  of  the  aboriginal  peoples  must  have  different understanding  and  views.
