Adouan  said  that  recently  some Western  media  reports  said  that  in  the  southern  city  Basra 5  kilometres  east  found  a  large  warehouses  and  found  boxes marked  "the  armed  forces"  words  of  arms.  He  said  that  "everyone should  know  this  is  an  old  warehouse,  built  in  1990  before ".  Adouane  those  accusations  were  subjected  to  Jordan.  He said,  even  though  Jordan  arms  found  in  Iraq,  it  would  certainly be  operated  in  the  United  Nations  has  yet  to  impose  an arms  embargo  against  Iraq.  Iraqi  troops  invaded  Kuwait  in 1989  by  the  United  Nations  and  the  comprehensive  sanctions, including  the  arms  embargo  on  some  of  the  sanctions  have not  yet  been  lifted.  At  present,  the  US  and  British  forces are  to  eliminate  weapons  of  mass  destruction  as  a  pretext to  launch  a  comprehensive  attack  on  Iraq.
