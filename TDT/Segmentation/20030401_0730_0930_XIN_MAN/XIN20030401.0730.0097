State  Sport  General  Administration  of  China  Winter  Sport  Management Center  director  Xiao  Tian1  indicated  that  Chinese  athletes in  the  2003  World  Figure  Skating  Championships  major  achievements, not  only  to  Shen  Xue  and  Zhao  Hongbo  double  slide  the  defending champion,  it  was  more  important  "first  created  three  history ".  Xiao  days  said:  "First,  Shen  Xue  /  Zhao  Hongbo  in  the technical  difficulties  and  artistic  expression  two  scores  are the  two  totalling  6  hours,  which  was  unprecedented  in  history. Secondly,  they  slide  in  the  free  competition  is  a  near  capacity audience  at  the  end  of  1  minutes  of  applause,  the  world were  Kam  competition  history.  Chinese  team  was  sent  to  the three  figure  skating  competitors  access  to  all  the  previous six.  This  is  unprecedented  in  the  history  of  the  world  Kam competition.  "  In  those  days  Xiao  said  that  this  only  shows that  China's  figure  skating  to  a  certain  status  in  the  world, not  occupy  the  top  position.

However,  it  should be  aware  that  a  4  from  3  to  advance  to  a  great  effort than  in  the  5  +  4  more  difficult.  I  think,  the  Chinese young  player  of  the  urgent  need  to  establish  their  own  style and  glide  through  competition  features.  This  is  a  very  difficult thing  they  are  relatively  rough  in  respect  of  the  details.
