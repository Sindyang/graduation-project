Backtracking from remarks by a Japanese military official, Japan's top government spokesman said his nation was still trying to confirm that North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Tuesday. The military officials said earlier in the day that North Korea test-fired a missile from its northwest coast into the Yellow Sea. Officials at the U.S. Defense Department in Washington later confirmed the launch. The Japanese and U.S. officials both said the missile did not represent a threat. However, South Korean officials _ who initially called the reported launch ``routine'' _ later cast the first doubt on the announcement, saying there was no evidence the launch had occurred. It was not immediately clear why there were conflicting reports. ``We have information about the missile but we have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' Japanese officials refused to disclose where they received the information, saying it was a security matter. Earlier Tuesday, the Japanese military and government officials _ including Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of the Maritime Self-Defense Forces, Japan's navy _ said North Korea fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. Japan last Friday launched two spy satellites into orbit to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs, angering Pyongyang, which threatened to test-fire a missile. Fears have been growing that thre reclusive communist state might take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. South Korean officials also flip-flopped after initially calling the launch ``routine.'' Its Defense Ministry later said there was no evidence that North Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. South Korea's new government, headed by President Roh Moo-hyun, has made strong efforts to reduce tensions with North Korea. The U.S. military announced Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops currently in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared last October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.
