Fearful that the isolation quarantine of 240 people in a Hong Kong building has not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials said Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. Residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to the holiday camps, one in the suburban New Territories and one in a rural part of Hong Kong island, said Dr. Leung Pak-yin, deputy director of health. Leung said ``environmental factors'' in the sealed-off building might be causing the disease to spread, but he did not elaborate in an evening news conference. There has been speculation a sewage leak might have spread the disease among residents of apartment units at one end of the 33-story building. ^ MORE &lt;
