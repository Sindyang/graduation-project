Valencia has renewed left back Amedeo Carboni's contract, keeping him at the club beyond his 39th birthday, news reports said Tuesday. Carboni, who turns 38 on Sunday, is the Spanish league's third oldest player. Deportivo de La Coruna's 40-year-old central defender Donato is the most senior while Mallorca left back Miquel Soler is a month older than Carboni. The former Italian international, who joined the club from AS Roma in 1997, was a key member of the Valencia team which won the Spanish league title last season for the first time in 31 years. He played in Valencia's Champions League final defeat in 2001, when he missed a penalty in the shoot-out loss to Bayern Munich. Valencia announced last month that its other old-timer, 37-year-old Yugoslav international defender Miroslav Djukic, would be leaving the club in June.
