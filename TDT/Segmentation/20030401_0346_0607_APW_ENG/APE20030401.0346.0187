Authorities had said previously that some 200 people were infected at Amoy Gardens, about half of them from the building that was sealed off. Hong Kong on Tuesday night reported another death of SARS patient, for 16 total here and at least 63 worldwide. Out of more than 1,600 SARS cases globally, 685 have been in Hong Kong. Separately, the Health Department said Tuesday a 30-year-old man with SARS symptoms had flown here from Bangkok aboard Thai Airways Flight TG606, and they wanted to locate all other passengers. The man became sick while he was staying in the Thai capital from March 25 to Saturday, but health officials in Hong Kong said they did not immediately know his nationality or where he contracted his illness. Global health officials say they have been worried by the spread of the illness by air travelers _ which is apparently how it moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada and Vietnam, all of which have suffered deaths. Hong Kong officials said earlier Tuesday that four recreational activity camps could be turned into quarantine centers for 1,000 people, but they were only sending the people from Amoy Gardens to two of them.
