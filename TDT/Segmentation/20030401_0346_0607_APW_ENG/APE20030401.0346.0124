The Los Angeles Lakers are running out of time to improve their playoff position. Shaquille O'Neal thinks that's no big deal. ``We want to move up in the standings. (But) it doesn't matter to us,'' O'Neal said after leading the three-time defending NBA champions to a 110-94 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night. ``If we don't move up, I'm not going to drink a can of rat poison.'' O'Neal had 34 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots as the Lakers (43-31) won for the eighth time in 11 games. The Lakers are in seventh place in the Western Conference with eight games remaining, but could get as high as fourth. They trail Utah by a half-game, Minnesota by 2{ and Portland by three. ``Eight games,'' O'Neal said firmly when asked how far away the Lakers were from being playoff-ready. ``I think the guys are going to start focusing more. We know what it takes.'' The Lakers began the season by losing 19 of their first 30 games. They've gone 32-12 since then. Kobe Bryant had 29 points, five rebounds, eight assists and six steals to equal a career high as the Lakers bounced back from an ugly 119-98 loss at Seattle a night earlier. O'Neal shot 15-of-22, making him 117-of-188 (62 percent) in the last nine games. Bryant was 10-of-23 including 3-of-5 from 3-point range. He's 20-of-33 (61 percent) on 3-pointers in the last five games. ``We know what we're capable of doing and we know what our track record in the playoffs is,'' Bryant said. ``So we want to utilize our experience as much as possible, build as much rhythm and momentum as we possibly can going into the playoffs, and then use our experience to try to wear down teams. The Lakers put Memphis away by scoring six straight points for an 85-70 lead with 9:04 remaining. The Grizzlies weren't closer than 10 points after that. Pau Gasol led Memphis with 22 points and 12 rebounds. Wesley Person added 20 points and Lorenzen Wright had 14 points and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies (26-48), who lost their fourth straight game. Mike Miller, who's averaging 16.1 points, was limited to nine minutes by back spasms.
