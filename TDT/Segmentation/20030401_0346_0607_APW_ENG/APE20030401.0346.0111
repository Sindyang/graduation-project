Tokyo stocks posted marginal gains on bargain hunting Tuesday. The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to end trading at 7,986.72. On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. It lost 27.7 percent of its value over fiscal 2002, which ended Monday. The dollar bought 118.04 yen at 5 p.m. (0800 GMT), down 0.98 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above the 118.14 yen in late New York trading overnight. The currency traded from 117.78 yen and 118.44 yen in Tokyo. On the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei index eked out gains in a seesaw session marking the first day of Japan's fiscal year. Blue chips Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and NTT DoCoMo led the rebound, which traders attributed to bargain hunting following a dizzying drop Monday of almost 4 percent. ``The market rebounded on adjustment as yesterday was overdone,'' said Masatsugu Okeya, general manager at Chuo Securities. Market sentiment remained subdued, however, as investors were discouraged by growing pessimism over the prospects for the war in Iraq. A central bank survey released Tuesday morning showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers worsened in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling stock prices and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. Volume on the first section was estimated at 863.83 million shares, up from 715.09 million shares Monday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 734 to 611, with 161 issues unchanged. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index closed up 0.96 points, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. The TOPIX, which includes all first-section issues, closed down 29.92 points, or 3.66 percent, Monday. In currencies, the dollar was under pressure amid continued worries over the U.S. economy and uncertainty about the war in Iraq. The euro bought US$1.0904 Tuesday late Tuesday in Tokyo, up from US$1.0874 late Monday. Against the yen, the euro traded at 128.64 yen, down from 129.40 yen. The yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond slipped to 0.6900 percent from 0.7000 percent late Monday. Its price rose 0.09 to 101.02. _ _ _ On the Net: Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange: http://www.tse.or.jpx
