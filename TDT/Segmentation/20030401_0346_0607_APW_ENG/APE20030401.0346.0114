The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq will likely encourage North Korea to speed up its nuclear program, a top Russian diplomat warned Tuesday. ''Unfortunately, the Iraqi situation is nudging North Korea toward the enhancement of its own defense capabilities,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ''North Korea earlier said that if it feels a threat, it would take appropriate steps, possibly including the creation of a certain powerful weapon for its own defense,'' he said. Asked whether the war in Iraq would encourage North Korea to continue developing its nuclear program, Losyukov was quoted as saying: ''That is absolutely obvious.'' ''I am afraid that the Iraqi situation is pushing (North Korea) in a direction that isn't in the interests of stability and security,'' Losyukov said. The North Korean nuclear crisis flared in October, when U.S. officials said North Korea acknowledged having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. nuclear monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor. Russia has urged Washington to immediately start talks with North Korea, warning that it is the only way to peacefully settle the crisis. (mb/ji)
