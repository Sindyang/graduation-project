British forces reported Tuesday the first indications that the tide of the war in southern Iraq may be turning in their favor, saying troops were patrolling in berets, not helmets, in four towns. In addition to improved security, lights flickered on for the first time in months in the port city of Umm Qasr, schools and shops were reopening and civilians were increasingly informing foreign troops about the whereabouts of paramilitary forces and members of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, British officials said. ``Within the southern area of Iraq, we see a large degree of normality starting to appear amongst the Iraqi population,'' said Group Capt. Al Lockwood, a spokesman for British forces in the Gulf. He stressed that tensions were still high in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city where British forces have skirmished almost daily with forces loyal to Saddam while trying to provide humanitarian aid to the city's 1.3 million people. And operations continued in the region of British patrols, including a raid on Baath party members in the town of Safwan, said another British spokesman, Col. Chris Vernon. But Lockwood said residents were increasingly willing to approach British troops who have ringed the city to inform about known paramilitaries and other loyalists. ``They realize that we are there to liberate them, not to occupy,'' he said. ``Certainly, there are still military engagements happening with the paramilitary forces, but the aid is flowing into Basra now.'' A senior U.S. Central Command official said late Monday he sensed that Basra may be nearing the ``tipping point,'' when civilians would turn on the regime and support the troops. He stressed though that was a feeling, not a hard assessment. ``You'll get to the tipping point at different places and different times,'' the official said, speaking on condition he not be identified further. ``I sense we're near the tipping point in Basra. I sense we're near the tipping point in An Nasiriyah,'' another southern city where U.S. troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance but have recently reported some cooperation from locals in hunting down regime supporters. The official said he had also received reports that farther to the north, in Najaf, civilians were lashing out at regime figures. The British appear confident that they have reached some level of security in four southern towns. On Tuesday, British troops had changed their combat helmets for berets in Umm Qasr, As Zubayr, Rumeila and Safwan, British officials said. Lockwood said the development was significant for two reasons: It makes the soldiers appear more friendly and approachable, and serves as a confidence-building measure on both sides. ``It shows that we have confidence in them, and they can have confidence in us,'' he said. In addition, more humanitarian aid was flowing into the region, including from the United Nations and other aid organizations, he said. Vernon called As Zubayr the ``litmus test,'' saying British troops had control of the town and were patrolling it, routing the last militia members and Baath party officials. U.S. and British officials have acknowledged the expected uprising by anti-Saddam Shiite residents of Basra and other southern towns in support of coalition troops hasn't borne out to any large degree. They have attributed the residents' wariness to the fact that when Shiites did rise up in 1991, allied forces largely abandoned them and left them to be punished by the Iraqi leadership. ``They have suffered tragically, enormously under the Saddam Hussein regime,'' Lockwood said. ``And although it's taken some time because of the events of 1991, they're beginning to gain the confidence now, they know we're not going away. They know we will be there to protect them.''
