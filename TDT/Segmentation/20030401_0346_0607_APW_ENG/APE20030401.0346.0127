Ratcheting up the war of words with Washington, Syria on Tuesday called the U.S.-British invasion of Iraq a ``fiasco'' and suggested American officials be tried for crimes against humanity. The English-language Syria Times newspaper _ one of several state-run newspapers _ said in an editorial that the invasion had proven to be a ``major embarrassment'' for the U.S. military and has led to anti-U.S. sentiments reaching ``unprecedented levels.'' ``The only way out is to stop the war immediately and hold those responsible for it 'accountable' for their crimes against humanity,'' the newspaper said. In a speech Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said ``Syria now faces a critical choice'' of whether to continue supporting terrorism ``in the dying days'' of Saddam Hussein's regime, suggesting it would face grave consequences. A Syrian Foreign Ministry official responded Monday by saying Syria ``has chosen to stand by the Iraqi people who are facing an illegitimate and unjustified invasion.'' Commenting on Powell's warning, the Syria Times said Powell had a choice of his own to make: ``He can continue direct support for the military in the invasion of Iraq, or he can embark on a different and more hopeful course and quit. ... ``U.S. officials must accept full responsibility for the aggression fiasco,'' it said. ``The war is unjustifiable and illegal.'' Another Syrian newspaper, the Baath daily, said Syria ``does not need (U.S.) advice. ``Syria is standing by itself and its nation by rejecting another aggression in the region,'' it said. ^ (zk-pfg) &lt;
