``I was firmly against the candidacy of Aleksander Nauman,'' Balicki said. ``I presented my opinion to the prime minister several times.'' Balicki's decision was the latest blow to Miller's Cabinet. Two opposition parties said Friday they will seek a parliamentary confidence vote aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik for the recent botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals that left two police officers dead Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki also was at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill. Health care reform has hamstrung a series of governments in post-communist Poland, where the medical care system is inefficient and hospitals are in debt. Balicki was appointed in January to replace Mariusz Lapinski, who was fired by Miller over his handling of the health care system's debts. The government says the new national health care fund, which began operation Tuesday, is the centerpiece of the an effort to make the chronically strapped health care system more efficient by centralizing medical payments. Based in the capital Warsaw, it replaces 17 regional funds that were set up by the previous Solidarity-led government to negotiate health care costs with local hospitals and doctors in an effort to introduce competition and market-oriented rules into the system. The government argues that the centralized system will make contract negotiations with hospitals and doctors easier. ^ (ms-tc-cb) &lt;
