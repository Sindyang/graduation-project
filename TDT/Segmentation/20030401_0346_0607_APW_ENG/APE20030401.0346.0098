The U.S. naval base at Rota in southern Spain will double the size of its hospital facilities to 250 beds to handle expected casualties from the war in Iraq. ``We need to prepare for a great number of casualties'' even if they don't materialize, commanding officer Captain P.J. Kelly said. ``That's just prudent.'' More than 50 soldiers have passed through the naval and air base, most in the past week since fighting in Iraq began March 20. About 35 were non-combat related, Kelly said. The rest were ``gunshot and shrapnel wounds _ very typical stuff.'' On Monday, reporters were allowed onto the base, which Spain owns and shares with the United States, to meet officers and interview naval corpsman 3rd class Carlos Cordova, who was recovering from a shrapnel wound to his right forearm. A week ago, Cordova was helping load an automatic grenade launcher when a mortar round struck nearby. ``The piece of shrapnel that cut my arm went into my buddy's shoulder behind me,'' said the 24-year-old native of Sugarland, Texas. The firefight took place near the southern city of Nasiriyah on what he described as a routine security patrol. Headed home to recover, Cordova sounded a bit disappointed he wouldn't be returning to his unit or seeing more of Iraq. ``It's not a bad-looking country except for all the ordnance lying around,'' he said. The U.S. Naval Station in Rota has a 116-bed hospital unit, built for the war in Iraq, that will be mothballed when the new 250-bed facility is ready, in about 10 days. Both are housed in specially equipped tents. The new one will be expandable to 500 beds and care is expected to be as good as that provided at the long-established U.S. armed forces facility at Landstuhl, Germany. ``We have all the skills,'' Capt. Kelly said. He said neither facility would treat victims of chemical or biological assault because facilities have already been set up in the Middle East and it's imperative soldiers get treatment as fast as possible.
