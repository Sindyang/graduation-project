Manchester United on Tuesday reported a 34 percent fall in profits but an overall improvement in its financial picture. Pre-tax profits in the six months ending Jan. 31 were reported at 20.3 million pounds (US$32.1 million), a decrease from the same period the previous year when the club sold Jaap Stam and Andy Cole for 16.3 million pounds (US$25.5 million). The world's richest soccer club said sales in the six-month period rose 13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (US$146.3 million). Operating profits before player sales increased 32 percent to 31.1 million pounds (US$49.1 million). Manchester United said its salary bill for the the period was 39.7 million (US$52.7 million), 43 percent of sales. It said that was within the target of 50 percent. The club said it expected its wage bill to reach 50 percent at the end of the next reporting period. Chief executive Peter Kenyon said Manchester United's financial health contrasted with the problems experienced by other English clubs. ``We have significantly improved our operating performance,'' Kenyon said. ``The strength of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United plc.'' ``We're delighted with what we think are a strong set of financial results. Today our shareholders will be very happy that we have a business which sets ourselves apart from the rest of the industry.'' (scw)
