New fighting killed one villager and three Muslim rebels, while three soldiers and 10 civilians were injured in clashes in the southern Philippines, the military said Tuesday. Guerrillas from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front torched several houses and a Roman Catholic chapel Monday before fleeing the village of Katipunan in Lanao del Norte province, said local army spokesman Maj. Julieto Ando. Village militiamen fought the rebels for about an hour before the guerrillas fled, leaving one villager dead and nine other people injured. In Midsayap, North Cotabato province, a platoon of soldiers fought about 50 MILF guerrillas for 30 minutes Monday before the rebels withdrew, leaving three of their comrades dead. Three army engineers and the wife of another soldier were injured early Tuesday as the rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades at an army engineering brigade's headquarters at Matanog town in Maguindanao province. Maj. Gen. Generoso Senga, commander of the 6th Infantry Division, denounced the rebel attack on the army engineers, who were asleep at the time. ``They should not be harmed because they are there to make projects _ roads, bridges _ for the people of Matanog, whether MILF or not,'' he said on DXMS radio. MILF vice chairman for military affairs, Al Haj Murad, said in a separate interview that the army engineers were legitimate targets because they are soldiers. He also justified rebel attacks on villages in which the military has established militia or army outposts, and said civilians were not targets. Murad's statement came after Muslim rebels earlier Monday had attacked two farming villages in North Cotabato province, wounding 12 civilians and taking eight others hostage. Hours later, the hostages were released unharmed after their mayor urged the rebels to set them free. Government and rebel representatives agreed in Malaysia last week to resume peace talks suspended two years ago. But Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes said that the military would continue to pursue rebels who violated laws.
