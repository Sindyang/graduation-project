British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed his trip to China, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. ``As to the specifics, you 'll have to refer it to the British side, but it is certainly not because of SARS,'' said Liu Jianchao, referring to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has killed at least 34 people in China. China welcomes Blair to visit at an appropriate time, said Liu at a regularly scheduled briefing. A spokesman for the British Embassy in Beijing declined to comment, citing a policy of never releasing details of Blair's schedule. The dates of Blair's planned visit had not been released. More than 1,600 people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and 62 have died _ including at least 34 in China, the government has said. Organizers have canceled the women's world ice hockey championships, scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday. The Rolling Stones have also canceled concerts in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing due to concerns over the illness. On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommended travelers put off nonessential trips to China.
