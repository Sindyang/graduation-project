Japanese fans and former players gave Hideki Matsui a passing mark Tuesday after the New York Yankees' outfielder picked up a hit in his major league debut. Matsui got off to an impressive start, hitting an RBI single in his first major league at-bat against Toronto. He finished 1-for-4 as the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 8-4. ``It was a nice hit to left,'' said former Yomiuri Giants outfielder Wally Yonamine. ``I thought he was a little anxious in some at-bats and could have waited a little more but he'll be fine. He's a good hitter.'' Matsui is one of Japan's most famous power hitters, hitting 332 homers in 10 seasons in Japan, including 50 last year for the Giants. Former Yomiuri player and manager Shigeo Nagashima also liked what he saw. ``Not a bad start,'' said Nagashima, who provided color commentary on NHK's live broadcast of the game. ``It was a relief to see him get his first hit and I'm looking forward to the next game.'' How many homers Matsui will be able to hit this season has been widely debated in the Japanese media with predictions ranging anywhere from 20 to 40. ``I hope he doesn't worry too much about the homers,'' added Yonamine. ``Facing new pitchers, it'll be hard for him the first time around the league and he should just concentrate on hitting .300.'' Fans who skipped school or took a day off work to watch Matsui's first game were content with the base hit. ``It was a great hit,'' said student Kento Usuda, who watched the game on a giant screen at the Baseball Cafe next to Matsui's old home, the Tokyo Dome. ``He was hitting for the team, not trying to do anything fancy.'' Matsui came up with runners on first and third and two outs in the first inning against Roy Halladay. He hit a hard grounder through the left side of the infield to drive in Derek Jeter with the Yankees' first run of the season. A huge ovation erupted at the Baseball Cafe when the ball skidded past third baseman Eric Hinske and into left field. ``He went with the pitch and it was clutch hitting,'' said Hideki Yasuoka, a restaurant worker who took a day off to watch the game. ``I think he'll be able to hit about 30 homers this season and hit .300.''
