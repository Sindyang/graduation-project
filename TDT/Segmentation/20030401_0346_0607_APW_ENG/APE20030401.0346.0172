Backtracking from remarks by a Japanese military official, Japan's top government spokesman said his nation was ``still trying to confirm'' that North Korea test-fired a short-range missile Tuesday. A Japanese admiral said Tuesday afternoon that North Korea test-fired a shore-to-ship missile from its northwest coast into the Yellow Sea. The U.S. Defense Department in Washington confirmed the report, and officials in both countries said the missile did not represent a threat. But Japan's top government spokesman backed away from those remarks hours later, speaking after South Korean officials said there was no evidence the launch had occurred. ``We have information about the missile but we have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda said. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' Fukuda told reporters the Japanese government had received reports that North Korea had launched a missile and had issued a warning for ships to avoid waters off its northwestern coast. The reclusive communist nation announced similar ``exclusion zones'' when it test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March, according to U.S. and Japanese officials. Japanese officials refused to disclose the source of the reports, saying it was a security matter. Tokyo and Washington are bound by a security treaty and regularly exchange intelligence. The reason for the conflicting reports was not clear. The confusion began when Koichi Furusho, chief of staff of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces, told reporters North Korea had fired a missile into the Yellow Sea. South Korean initially echoed the report, calling the reported launch ``routine.'' But its Defense Ministry later said there was no evidence that North Korea had test-fired a missile. ``South Korean and U.S. military intelligence officials have checked on the report and concluded that there was no missile launch by North Korea,'' a ministry official said on customary condition of anonymity. Pyongyang threatened to test-fire a missile after Japan launched two spy satellites Friday to keep watch over the North's missile and nuclear programs. Fears have been growing it might take advantage of the war in Iraq to escalate its missile and nuclear development. The U.S. military announced Tuesday that U.S. stealth fighter jets and other aircraft and troops currently in South Korea for joint war games will remain after the exercises are finished to act as a deterrent against North Korea. In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March amid tensions over its suspected nuclear weapons programs. Washington and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks. With the United States focused on the war in Iraq, some experts say North Korea might exploit the opportunity to test long-range missiles or reprocess spent nuclear fuel to make atomic bombs. The Korean nuclear crisis flared last October, when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a nuclear program in violation of a 1994 agreement. Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments, and the North retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear reactor.
