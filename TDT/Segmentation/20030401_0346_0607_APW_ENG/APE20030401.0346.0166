Train engineers for the German railroad will vote Thursday in whether to accept an arbitrator's recommended wage package to end a dispute that has disrupted thousands of travelers, officials said Tuesday. Arbitrators recommended late Monday a settlement that would give the engineers a 3.2 percent raise next year. The proposed settlement echoes a deal reached March 15 with labor unions that represent other Deutsche Bahn employees. I'm optimistic it will gain approval,'' Deutsche Bahn spokesman Uwe Herz said. The deal will see workers receive two payments of 200 euros (US$216) each this year, followed by a 3.2 percent raise from May 1, 2004. It also will bring pay for employees in formerly communist eastern Germany up to parity with that of those in the more affluent west by 2006. Rail workers staged a series of short stoppages in early March, and striking engineers on March 6 briefly brought trains to a halt across the country. Later that day, the GdL union walked out of pay talks with Deutsche Bahn, taking the dispute to arbitration. GdL went into the pay talks seeking a 3-percent wage increase this year. The rail company, which is in the middle of an efficiency drive to make it fit for possible privatization, had warned that a big pay rise could force it to lay off more staff. (swg-cb)
