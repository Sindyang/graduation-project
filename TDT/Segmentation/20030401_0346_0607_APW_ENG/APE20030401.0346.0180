CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's new military commander in Europe outlined his vision Tuesday of an alliance transformed to tackle 21st-century threats of terrorism and instability, even as its members remain bitterly divided over the Iraq war. U.S. Marine Gen. James L. Jones told reporters first elements of NATO's rapid reaction force should be operational this year. It would eventually be able to deploy thousands of troops to troublespots around the world _ if the alliance's political leaders can agree on it. ``We are seeing a military metamorphosis of the alliance,'' said Jones, who took up his NATO post Jan. 17. ``If the nations wish to have a force that has an out-of-area capability, beyond a regional capability, we could build that.'' Jones' comments came as NATO diplomats in Brussels embark on tentative discussions on a possible alliance role in peacekeeping in Afghanistan, or even postwar Iraq. Although divisions over Iraq have plunged NATO into a deep crisis, diplomats at alliance headquarters in the Belgian capital are sounding out support for a role in peacekeeping or nation-building after the fighting is over there. The United States last year proposed NATO take on such a role, but the plan was shelved in the face of opposition from France, Germany and Belgium. Diplomats say informal talks have resumed on the plan that would build on NATO's experience peacekeeping in Bosnia and Kosovo. NATO officials said it was far too early to see if a consensus could be found among the 19 allies. France and Belgium have already expressed doubts about a proposal for the alliance to take over command of the peacekeeping operation in the Afghan capital Kabul, which is currently being led by German troops. Diplomats from other countries were still hopeful a solution could be found that would give the alliance a greater role there. Jones stressed he had received no orders to prepare for NATO operations in either Afghanistan or Iraq, but he highlighted the debate within the alliance over a possible role, well beyond its traditional Euro-Atlantic theater. Speaking at alliance military headquarters in southern Belgium, he outlined plans for the proposed NATO reaction force of 20,000-strong rapidly deployable, air, land and sea units to be the spearhead of a leaner, more agile alliance. Addressing budget concerns of European members, Jones said the more mobile, lighter forces needed by NATO could be constructed without major new outlay. ``So much of the money that we need can be done through some in-depth reforms,'' he said. ``My goal is to build or the NATO reaction force from existing capacities without asking for more money.'' Jones, who also serves as commander of U.S. forces in Europe, restated plans to restructure the American deployment away from the Cold War focus on major concentrations in Germany, to smaller, more flexible bases in new NATO members to the east, such as Romania and Bulgaria, who are due to join next year. He repeated that such plans were based on the needs of military modernization, rather than U.S. displeasure at Germany's opposition to the Iraq war. Jones welcomed European Union efforts to build up military capabilities, as reflected in the EU launching its first military operation Monday by replacing NATO peacekeepers in Macedonia. However he cautioned European nations against initiatives that seek to duplicate or rival NATO structures. ``It would be very expensive and somewhat redundant to make two capabilities,'' Jones said. ^ (pa-rac) &lt;
