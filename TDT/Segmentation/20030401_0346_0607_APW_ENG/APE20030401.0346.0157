An additional 75 people were hit by a mystery flu-like disease in Hong Kong, including 52 from an apartment complex where one building has been placed under an isolation quarantine order, health officials said Tuesday. An 83-year-old man with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has also died, bringing the territory's death count to 16, the Health Department said Tuesday evening. It was not immediately clear if he had died Monday or Tuesday. Most of the new SARS patients are people from the Amoy Gardens apartment complex, where more than 240 residents were ordered Monday to spend 10 days inside one building that has been sealed off. Hong Kong has now reported 685 cases of SARS but says 84 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. The disease has sickened more than 1,600 and killed at least 62 globally. The Health Department says most of the SARS patients who died either had histories of chronic diseases or who had sought treatment relatively late.
