MADRID, Spain (AP) _ U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers says he does not plan to lower the estimate of 600,000 refugees expected from Iraq even though only a trickle of people had fled the country since the American and British invasion began. ``So far, only a few thousand have knocked on the door but this is no surprise,'' Lubbers told a news conference Monday. ``Refugees don't come at the beginning of a war. They only start arriving as the crisis wears on, when there are scarcities of food and water and internal divisions begin.'' Lubbers said that in many cases people flee their countries even after a political settlement has been reached. The commissioner was in Madrid this week for talks with conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, one of the strongest supporters of the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq. Spain has sent some 9,000 troops and equipment to the Gulf region for what it describes as humanitarian operations. Lubbers said he would have favored trying to avoid military action. ``But some permanent members of the Security Council preferred to disagree,'' he said. ``They sidelined the U.N. and preferred to go for military intervention.'' The UNHCR has budgeted a total of $US153 million to deal with a projected 600,000 refugees from Iraq over six months. He compared the figure with the $US195 million budgeted for both refugee and repatriation programs in Afghanistan for an entire year. Commenting on the possible length of the war against Iraq, Lubbers said, ``I don't think all the problems will be resolved in a single month.'' He said the UNHCR began preparations for the refugee influx several months ago by holding talks with Iraq's neighbors, most notably Iran and Syria. At the moment, they are prepared to deal with some 300,000 refugees. The commissioner said that any leftover money would be used to help with the repatriation of between 500,000 and 1 million Iraqi exiles hoping to return home after the war. (cg-eg)
