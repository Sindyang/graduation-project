Iraq's matches against Vietnam in the qualifying tournament for the 2004 Olympic soccer tournament have been postponed because of the war in the country, FIFA said Tuesday. The decision was made ``in view of the current political circumstances and the impossibility of any communication with the Iraq Football Association,'' world soccer's governing body said. Iraq was due to play Vietnam at home April 5, although FIFA had already ordered that the match should be played at a neutral venue. The return match was slated for April 19. FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation are now in the process of finding new dates and will inform all of the involved parties as soon as possible,'' FIFA said. ^ (nk) &lt;
