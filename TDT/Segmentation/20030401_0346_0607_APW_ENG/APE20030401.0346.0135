The World Economic Forum said Tuesday it has postponed until fall a Beijing meeting of business and government leaders because participants were concerned about a deadly new flu-like disease. ``There's been a lot of concerns voiced by our participants about international and regional travel,'' said Pamela Mar, associate director for China at the Geneva-based organization. Mar said the Forum reached its decision after ``prudent'' consultations with the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control about the spread of the disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. ``We don't want our participants to feel they're having to jeopardize their safety to attend,'' Mar said. The meeting had been set for April 14-15. ``It's especially because so many of our participants are coming from within China and as well Hong Kong and Singapore, which have been very heavily hit,'' she said. ``People are just not feeling that comfortable about getting on airplanes.'' More than 1,600 people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and more than 60 have died. Chinese officials last week acknowledged at least 34 deaths from the illness _ 31 of them in the southern province of Guangdong, where the disease is believed to have originated. ``It's difficult for us in good faith to have a summit where there's any chance or any risk or people feeling that it's dangerous to be there,'' Mar said. The meeting was intended to be the first major opportunity for the world business community to get to know the new leaders of China following changes by the National People's Congress. Also attending are to be top officials of the World Trade Organization, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development and other international bodies, as well as from selected countries, Mar said. A new date, tentatively expected in September or October, will be set following consultations with the participants, Mar said. The World Intellectual Property Organization, the U.N. agency to protect copyrights and patents, said Tuesday it was considering whether to postpone an April 24-26 meeting in Beijing. The meeting, billed as a ``summit'' with national leaders from different countries, expected to attend, is to discuss ``intellectual property and the knowledge economy.'' ``We are talking to the Chinese and assessing the situation,'' said spokeswoman Samar Shamoon, adding that the agency would probably make an announcement later this week. The International Labor Organization also is considering whether to go ahead with its China Employment Forum, due to take place in Beijing April 7-9. ^ (nk-agh-jf) &lt;
