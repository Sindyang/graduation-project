A moderate earthquake shook northwestern Turkey on Tuesday forcing residents to flee their homes in a panic, the Istanbul-based Kandilli Observatory said. No injuries or damages were reported. The observatory said the quake, registering a preliminary magnitude of 3.7, struck the town of Akyazi at 10:51 a.m.(0751 GMT). A municipality official in Akyazi said teams had been dispatched to investigate any damage or injuries, but none had been reported. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said residents ran into the streets when the quake struck. Quakes are frequent in Turkey, which lies on the active North Anatolian fault. Two massive earthquakes hit northwestern Turkey in 1999, killing some 18,000 people. Akyazi is 150 kilometers (90 miles) west of Istanbul. ^ mn-ht
