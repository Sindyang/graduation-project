Afghan government troops searching for rebels found a stash of weapons in an abandoned mountain camp believed to have been a base for Taliban fighters, a senior Afghan official said Tuesday. The troops, following a trail in the Dara-e-Noor mountains north of Kandahar, stumbled on tents and mud huts that appeared to be a base for about 30 Taliban fighters, said Khalid Pashtoon, a spokesman for the regional governor. ``We found some explosive material they were using to make bombs,'' Pashtoon said. They also found motorcycles. Pashtoon said the Taliban had ordered the residents of two nearby villages, Thanaucha and Ilabac, to leave _ apparently in preparation for a battle with government forces _ Pashtoon said after returning from the area. The discovery was made in Shahmardan Ghar, 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Kandahar. The area was the scene of recent fighting between Afghan government troops and suspected Taliban fighters in which eight Taliban were killed and 12 captured. One of the dead was identified as Mullah Gul Mahd, a front-line commander with the Taliban militia, Pashtoon said.
