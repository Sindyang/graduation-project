France's prime minister told lawmakers Tuesday that displays of anti-Americanism in protests against the war in Iraq would be ``unacceptable.'' The government should also be on guard against any signs of racism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia, Jean-Pierre Raffarin was quoted as saying by spokesman Jean-Francois Cope. France has made a string of comments in recent days to attempt to smooth relations with the United States, which have been tense for months over Paris' high-profile opposition to military action in Iraq. Raffarin on Monday said that despite that opposition, France is not an enemy of the United States. Last week, the Foreign Ministry issued a special statement saying Paris hoped U.S.-led forces would win the war. ``It is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament on Tuesday. The government is also worried about the frequent protests against the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. Angry demonstrators attacked two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights group posted monitors along an anti-war march route to guard against displays of anti-Semitism. The government ``will not tolerate any racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic acts,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as saying. (parf-jc)
