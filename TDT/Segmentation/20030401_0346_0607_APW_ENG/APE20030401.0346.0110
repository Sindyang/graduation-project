The Iraq war has cost Israel nearly US$200 million so far, including production losses and security preparations, reports said Tuesday. The Manufacturers Association of Israel said the economy lost about US$64.3 million in the first two days of the war, primarily because many Israelis did not report to work amid concerns that Saddam Hussein would attack Israel with Scud missiles, as he did in the 1991 Gulf War. In addition, the callup of 11,000 reserve soldiers since the start of the war is costing Israel nearly US$110 million, the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said. Israel also told residents to open their gas mask kits, which will cost an additional US$17.1 million because the filters _ which have a limited life span once opened _ will now have to be replaced, the newspaper reported. These figures don't take into account the costs of vaccinating thousands of rescue and health officials against small pox or sealing rooms in schools and other public buildings. ^ rpm-kl
