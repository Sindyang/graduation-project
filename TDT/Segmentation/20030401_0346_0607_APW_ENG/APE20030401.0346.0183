Israel's foreign minister confirmed Tuesday, after meetings in Washington, that the United States is determined to publish its Mideast peace plan soon, and said Israel would seek changes before accepting it. The Israeli opposition leader, Amram Mitzna, and Palestinian officials said Israel is effectively rejecting the plan, a three-stage ``road map'' to Palestinian statehood by 2005. The Americans are ``determined to publish the road map,'' the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, told Israel Army Radio on Tuesday, a day after meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush at the White House. Shalom laid down a number of conditions for the resumption talks with the Palestinians and said that ``the road map needs to be adapted.'' Israel has repeatedly said it accepts the ``Bush vision'' based on a broad-based policy speech delivered by the U.S. president on June 24, 2002, but has balked at embracing the road map _ drawn up by the United States, the European Union, Russia and The United Nations _ that outlines the implementation of the Bush vision. ``We expect that after the road map is published the first things they (the Palestinians) must do is halt the terror and the incitement,'' Shalom said. If the conditions are met, Israel would be a ``true partner, exploring all roads to peace,'' Shalom said. The road map envisions a Palestinian state in provisional borders by the end of the year. After a cease-fire is in place, Palestinians would have to work hard to rein in militants, while Israel would have to withdraw from Palestinian cities and freeze settlement construction. The United States and Britain have said the road map would be unveiled after the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, and his new Cabinet are sworn in, probably sometime this month. Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said Israel's demands for changes amount to a rejection of the plan. ``We had hoped that Mr. Shalom would have announced Israel's full commitment and acceptance of the road map. In reality he actually announced Israel's rejection,'' Erekat said. Israeli Labor Party Chairman Amram Mitzna said he suspected the Israeli government was playing for time. ``This is a recipe to say yes while in reality saying no,'' Mitzna told Army Radio. Also Tuesday, Israeli troops demolished the homes of five suspected Palestinian militants, including that of a suicide bomber who blew himself up in the coastal city of Netanya over the weekend. In the West Bank village of Deir Ghassoon near Tulkarem, forces destroyed the home of Rami Ghanem, 20 _ the Islamic Jihad bomber who blew up on Sunday at Cafe London in Netanya, wounding 49 people, the army said. Islamic Jihad said the bombing, the first since the U.S.-led war in Iraq began, was a ``gift'' to the Iraqi people and vowed to step up its attacks against Israel during the war. The group also said it had sent suicide bombers to Iraq to help fight American and British soldiers. In the Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah, troops demolished four homes belonging to four suspected militants from one family, the Najis, the army said. The four were members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militia affiliated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. The Naji family is accused of carrying out and plotting a series of attacks on Israelis, the army said. The Najis participated in a shooting attack in a Tel Aviv restaurant in March 2002 in which three people were killed and another in Jerusalem in February 2002 in which a police officer was killed, the army said. ^ pvs-gr/kl &lt;
