Germany's ambassador to Australia on Tuesday criticized as too lenient a three-year suspended sentence handed to a tour guide blamed for the death of a German tourist killed by a crocodile. The suspended sentence means tour guide Glenn Robless, 46, will not serve any prison time unless he commits another offense. ``I was a bit amazed by the sentence which this person has got,'' ambassador Klaus-Peter Klaiber said on a visit to the northern city of Darwin. ``I don't know all the details, but I believe that probably in a German court he would not have got away with a suspended sentence.'' Robless was sentenced last week after pleading guilty in a Darwin court to the charge of making a dangerous omission which caused the death of backpacker Isabel von Jordan. He had faced a maximum 10-year sentence. Von Jordan, 23, was killed by a 4.6-meter (15-foot) crocodile after Robless took her and other tourists for a nighttime swim in a water hole in the Kakadu national park in northern Australia despite signs warning of the presence of crocodiles. ``He is running free and yet he was gravely engaged in that accident. There were warnings all over the place and he was an experienced tourist guide who should have known (better),'' Klaiber said. ``I think if you are so seriously disregarding rules and regulations which cause the death of a person then I think a little harsher sentence would have been justified.'' Klaiber warned that coverage of the case in the German press could deter people from visiting northern Australia _ where crocodiles inhabit many rivers and lakes.
