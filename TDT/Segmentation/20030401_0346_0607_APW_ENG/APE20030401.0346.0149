A court in Azerbaijan sentenced 15 people on Tuesday to two to nine years in prison in connection with a village protest last year that turned violent. Police opened fire June 2 on demonstrators seeking better services in the village of Nardaran, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Baku. One villager was killed, 15 others received gunshot wounds and 50 suffered other injuries. About 80 police officers were also injured. Villagers said they were just asking for gas for heating and cheaper drinking water, but Azeri authorities have accused the village of being a center of Islamic extremism. Alikram Aliyev, a senior member of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Jabrail Alizade, a member of the village's council of elders, received an eight-year sentence. Two others received five-year sentences, and 11 villagers received sentences between two and three years. The villagers were convicted of organizing massive disorder, acting against the authorities and participating in and organizing activities that breach community order. Since the June protest, Nardaran has become a flashpoint of anti-government activity, hosting regular protests. Azerbaijan's opposition has accused President Geidar Aliev of stifling dissent and media freedom in this Caspian Sea nation. Aliev, a Communist Party boss in Soviet times, has twice won elections criticized as fraudulent. (as/mb/ji)
