European aircraft manufacturer Airbus has received an order for seven A330-200 aircraft from Egyptair, the company announced Tuesday. Deliveries are scheduled to begin in June 2004, Airbus said. Egyptair plans to operate the new aircraft, which seat about 275 passengers, on routes mainly within the Middle East and to Europe. Based on Airbus catalog prices, the total order is worth about US$966 million, or US$138 million per plane. Egyptair is one of Airbus' main customers in the Middle East, and already operates seven A320s, four A321s, three A340-200, two A300B4 freighters and seven A330-600 aircraft. It already has five A320 planes on order, to be delivered in the coming months. (dj-eg)
