Another cow in northern Italy has tested positive for mad cow disease, bringing the country's total to 92, the Health Ministry said Tuesday. The animal came from a farm in the province of Turin, a health official said, citing confirmation from a Turin zoological institute that acts as the nation's national control center for the disease. Italy detected its first case of the disease, a chronic degenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system of cattle, in 2001. Tests began after the European Union ordered mandatory testing on cattle older than 30 months destined for slaughter. Last year, Italy reported its first case of the human form of the brain-wasting illness in a young woman in Sicily. Experts believe the human variant of the illness is transmitted by eating meat from infected livestock. Almost 1.5 million animals have been examined since testing started, the ministry said. (ic/ar)
