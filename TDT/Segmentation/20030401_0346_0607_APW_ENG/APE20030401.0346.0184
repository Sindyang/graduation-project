The European Union head office on Tuesday called the killing by U.S. soldiers of at least seven Iraqi women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq ``a horrible tragedy.'' It urged both forces on both sides of the war to spare civilian lives. ``No matter how advanced the technology in the hands of soldiers ... there is no such thing as an intelligent war,'' said European Commission spokesman Reijo Kemppinen. He also appealed to both sides to respect the Geneva convention on the fair and humane treatment of prisoners of war. On Monday, U.S. soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq. The U.S. military said the soldiers opened fire Monday when the driver of the van failed to stop as ordered. ^ (rw-pa)
