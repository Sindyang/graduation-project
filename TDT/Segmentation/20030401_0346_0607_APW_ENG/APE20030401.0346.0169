The Spanish health ministry said Tuesday it was monitoring a probable case of the flu-like illness that has killed 62 people around the world. If confirmed it would be Spain's first case, after a false alarm last month in the southwest Extremadura region. Doctors in Bilbao in the Basque region were awaiting results of tests on a 31-year-old man who returned March 21 from a trip to Hong Kong and mainland China and fell ill a few days later. The patient was hospitalized Monday in Bilbao and placed in isolation, the Basque health department said. Scientists have yet to identify the disease, which has sickened more than 1,600 people, mostly in Asia, and they are working to find a cure. Its initial symptoms include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Since March 17 Spanish health authorities have monitored 20 flights arriving from Asia and checked 2,633 travelers, the health ministry said. (dw)
