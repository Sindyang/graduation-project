About 50 Pakistanis protested in Hong Kong Tuesday against new visa requirements that the territory's government said were imposed on Pakistan and other countries ``due to the war in Iraq.'' ``What do you mean, due to the war in Iraq?'' asked one demonstrator, Syed Qaisar, who owns an electronics business in Hong Kong. ``We are not from Iraq. We are not from America.'' Hong Kong immigration officials said Friday that citizens of Pakistan and Eritrea will require visas to enter the territory under new measures imposed because of the war. Both had previously been allowed to stay visa-free for up to 14 days. The demonstrators accused Hong Kong of unfairly singling them out. They chanted outside government headquarters with a sign that said: ``We are not terrorist Pakistanis.'' Qaisar noted that Pakistan enjoys good relations with China, which regained sovereignty over Hong Kong, a former British colony, in July 1997. The Immigration Department said in a statement that its new policy was ``due to the war in Iraq,'' but did not specify what connection Pakistan and Eritrea might have with that conflict. Asked about any connections, a spokeswoman for the department said Tuesday she had no immediate answer but would try to get one. Hong Kong's visa policies ``take into account factors such as the social, economic and political situations of countries,'' the Immigration statement said. Hong Kong also said Friday it had ``increased its scrutiny'' of visa applications from Iraqis, Afghans, Iranians, Lebanese, Libyans, Palestinians, Sudanese and Syrians ``until further notice.''
