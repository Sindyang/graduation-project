Northern Ireland's Nobel Peace Prize laureate John Hume arrived in Sri Lanka Tuesday to share his peacemaking experiences with Sri Lankan leaders and Tamil Tiger rebels. The Sri Lankan government has said it hopes to draw from Northern Ireland's experiences in creating a power-sharing administration in Sri Lanka's efforts to end a 19-year civil war that has killed nearly 65,000 people. Hume, former leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic party, was a key player in formulating Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement in 1998. He shared the Nobel Peace Prize the same year with David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party, for their efforts to forge the power-sharing pact. A Norwegian-brokered cease-fire has stopped the fighting between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels and given the island nation its best chance for peace in recent years. The parties have held six rounds of peace talks, with the rebels saying they are willing to give up their demand for a separate state and accept a power sharing arrangement instead. Hume is to meet with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday, and then travel to northern rebel-held territory on Thursday to meet with Tamil Tiger leaders. He also is scheduled to give a lecture, meet with lawmakers and hold talks with President Chandrika Kumaratunga before leaving Sri Lanka on Saturday. The Tigers accuse the majority Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, of discrimination in education and jobs against the country's 3.2 million minority Tamils, most of whom are Hindu and live in the north. ^ (dss) &lt;
