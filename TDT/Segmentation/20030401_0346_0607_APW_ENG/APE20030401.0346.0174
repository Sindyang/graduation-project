Italian police have arrested four people _ one Egyptian, one Somali and two Iraqi Kurds _ who are suspected of having links with Islamic terrorist groups, anti-terrorism police said Tuesday. The arrests were ordered by Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who has been leading investigations into suspected Islamic cells in Italy. Bruno Megale of Milan's anti-terrorism police confirmed the arrests but refused to say where or when the arrests were made, saying the probe was in progress. The Italian news agency ANSA and other reports said that two were picked up in Milan and two in Parma, another northern Italian city. They were planning to leave the country, the reports said. Italian dailies Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica, reporting on the arrests that were apparently carried out Monday evening, said the men were suspected of belonging to an extremist Islamic group based in northern Iraq and called Ansar al-Islam. Corriere said that before the arrests, the suspects' telephone conversations had been tapped for months. Dambruoso's office said the prosecutor was in meetings and couldn't comment on the reports. U.S. officials believe that Ansar al-Islam, a tiny Kurdish group, is linked to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's terror network. In a speech before the U.N. Security Council in February, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that bin Laden's man in Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, has set up a camp in a corner of northern Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam. Powell also said that Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against several countries, including Italy. The arrests were the latest in a series of raids that have brought dozens of suspected terrorists behind bars in Italy. Many of those suspects were later released for lack of evidence. (ar-fd)
