About 2,000 protesters marched through Manila on Tuesday to protest the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, as the Philippine foreign secretary supported a call for Saddam Hussein to step down. About 20 motorcycle riders led the marchers _ chanting ``Stop the war in Iraq!'' _ down the Makati business district's main road. Shirtless men and boys with letters painted on their torsos formed a line with the message: ``War is stupid!'' One activist wore an Uncle Sam hat and carried a toy rifle as he pulled an effigy of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, depicted as a lapdog with its tongue sticking out and painted with the American flag. Arroyo is among the staunchest Asian allies of the U.S.-led war on terrorism. She said the Philippines is part of the ``coalition of the willing,'' providing moral and political support to U.S. actions to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Anti-war protests, most at the U.S. Embassy, have been held almost daily since the attack on Iraq began last month. Philippine Foreign Secretary Blas Ople said on Tuesday he supports the Saudi Arabian foreign minister's suggestion that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein should step down for the sake of his people. ``Perhaps with the greater good of his people in mind, and with more nations echoing the same sentiment, perhaps President Saddam might heed such a suggestion and end the war by leaving Iraq,'' Ople said in a statement. Saddam would ``spare the Iraqi people from further humanitarian suffering'' by stepping down, Ople said. Last month, Arab leaders declined to endorse a proposal from the United Arab Emirates for Saddam to step down and leave the country to avoid a U.S.-led invasion. The Iraqis later refused to accept an Arab League delegation after reports circulated that the members would raise the possibility of Saddam going into exile.
