Continuing its Mediterranean cruise through Euro 2004 qualifying, France has docked in the Sicilian capital for an encounter with Israel on Wednesday. The match is considered a home game for the Israelis, who are not permitted to play in their own country due to UEFA worries about security in the Middle East. While security will be high for the match, the game itself should be another easy victory for the defending champions, the French. On Saturday, France routed Malta 6-0 in Lens, improving slightly on the 4-0 win scored at the home stadium of the tiny island nation. In a slightly tougher test, France defeated Cyprus 2-1 in the eastern Mediterranean city of Nicosia in September. In all, ``Les Bleus'' have managed four wins in four qualifiers thus far, earning 12 points and thus running away with the automatic berth they can secure by winning the group. Israel and Cyprus, tied for second with four points each, are in a fight for second place and a spot in the playoffs. ``A zero-risk situation doesn't exist, but at the moment we don't feel under any particular threat,'' said team general manager Gerard Enault. France's current status is a far cry from its sorry state after scoring no goals and earning no points in last year's defense of its 1998 World Cup title. Since that ragged performance in South Korea, France's only losses have come in friendly matches. Yet coach Jacques Santini, who took control of the team following the World Cup, insisted his side is wary of Israel. ``I said that we couldn't take the Maltese lightly and the same goes for the Israelis,'' Santini said. ``There are no easy games or opponents, and for proof, just look at the results from the last round of qualifying. Who would have said that Germany would draw with Lithuania? ``I'm certain that the Israelis will find extra motivation by the fact that they can't count on the support of their fans.'' Santini could have also mentioned a 3-2 victory that Israel scored against France in qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, which helped keep France out of the U.S.-based tournament. For Wednesday's match, Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane will once again wear the captain's armband for France, since Marcel Desailly is out with an injury. Zidane scored twice against Malta, breaking his yearlong scoring drought with the national team. Patrick Vieira, the man Zidane beat out for the armband honor, is expected to return from a knee injury that kept him out of the Malta contest. ``It's not painful anymore and I'm at the coach's disposal,'' the Arsenal captain said. Israel is coming off a 1-1 draw at Cyprus, where Omri Afek scored on a header in just the second minute. On Wednesday, an early goal may be the Israelis only shot at staying competitive. Some 1,000 security officers will be deployed. About 500 Israeli fans, 2,000 French fans and a couple thousand Italians were expected to turn out for the match. Said local organizer Alessandro Amato: ``I think the local fans have been scared off by all the security.'' Sagit Levy, who works for the Israeli soccer federation, said the situation here was not that much different from at home. ``We have a really tough situation in Israel,'' she said. ``There is a lot of security, but we try not to think about it.'' France reportedly did not want to play the match at one point because of safety fears. Zidane said his team had no trouble with the match logistics: ``We had to travel anyway. I would say, that if there is a problem, it's more for them because they can't play at home.'' (asd-fd)
