Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect behind the assassination of Serbia's prime minister. Police said in a statement that Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the leader of an underworld Belgrade clan, also is linked to other politically motivated killings during Milosevic's autocratic rule. Lukovic and his gang ``killed political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic and a fake Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name, which ''will speed up the arrest of that criminal.'' Lukovic has been on the run since the March 12 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic by a sniper in downtown Belgrade. A special police unit under Lukovic's command until 2001 was suspected of having carried out Djindjic's killing as well as slaying former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in August 2000. The police statement came a day after authorities sought an international arrest warrant for Markovic, alleging she was involved in Stambolic's killing. She denounced the warrant in a message from Russia as a political ploy. Police said the investigation of Djindjic's killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy led by war criminals and war profiteers ... all from the ranks of Milosevic's regime.'' As president, Milosevic allowed underworld figures to fight alongside notorious paramilitary units in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, he gave them a free hand to join regular police forces, such as the special police unit linked to crime and drug trafficking rings, authorities said. Those ties continued even after the pro-democracy leadership took over in 2000. Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to the Netherlands-based U.N. war crimes tribunal. Later, Djindjic spearheaded efforts to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac said Monday the warrant to be issued for Markovic's arrest was part of an effort by authorities to find those who ordered the killing of Stambolic. Authorities said there were ``credible suspicions'' of her involvement. Markovic became known as the ``red witch'' for the influence she wielded over Milosevic and his leftist Socialist Party. Stambolic, Serbia's president for a year in the late 1980s, was preparing to challenge Milosevic in national elections when he disappeared on Aug. 25, 2000, just two months before Milosevic was ousted. Serbian police last week discovered Stambolic's body during a crackdown on the paramilitary and underworld network accused of Djindjic's assassination. Markovic reportedly left for Russia in late February to join her son, Marko Milosevic, who fled Serbia following Milosevic's ouster. (ds/rp/cb)
