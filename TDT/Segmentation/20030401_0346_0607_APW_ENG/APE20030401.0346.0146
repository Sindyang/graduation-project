SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. stealth fighter jets in South Korea for joint war games will remain to act as a deterrent against North Korea, the U.S. military said Tuesday amid conflicting reports about whether the communist state test-fired a short-range missile. Reports of the missile test came just days after Tokyo launched its first spy satellites into orbit to watch over the North's missile and suspected nuclear weapons programs. Japan and South Korea are concerned that Pyongyang might use the Iraq war to escalate the North's weapons development. Keeping the radar-evading U.S. aircraft in South Korea could further spike tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The F-117 stealth aircraft are capable of taking out the North's Yongbyon nuclear plant _ an attack North Korea has accused Washington of plotting. ``Extending their training time in the Korean Theater of Operations affords an excellent opportunity to further enhance interoperability while also enhancing deterrence,'' the U.S. statement said. Japanese officials initially said Tuesday that North Korea fired a ground-to-ship missile into the Yellow Sea, and U.S. officials confirmed the launch. Both said the launch was not a threat. But South Korean officials _ while initially describing the launch as ``routine'' _ later said there was no evidence it occurred. Japan subsequently announced it could not confirm the launch. There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting accounts. The U.S. military statement said that in addition to an unspecified number of stealth aircraft, some F-15E fighter jets and a small Army task force would stay on in South Korea. Thousands of troops have been here for the past months for war games withthe South's military that were scheduled to finish Wednesday. The statment said that more than 85 percent of those visiting forces would leave by Friday. About 37,000 U.S. troops are regularly based in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. The last time the United States based stealth fighters in South Korea indefinitely was in 1994 when Washington was embroiled in a similar dispute with North Korea about its nuclear program. That crisis ended peacefully, but not before then-U.S.President Bill Clinton considered a surgical strike on Yongbyon. Ten years later, President George W. Bush has said he wants to peacefully resolve the crisis but has not ruled out a military solution. The current dispute flared in October when U.S. officials said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994 deal. Pyongyang denies making such an admission. A spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry said keeping the stealth aircraft in the South would send a message to Pyongyang that it must not threaten its neighbors while U.S. forces are focused in Iraq. Pyongyang has repeatedly accused the United States of planning to invade the communist country after its forces are done fighting in Iraq. It has also said Washington was using the war games with South Korea as training for the attack. South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun has been trying to defuse tension with North Korea since taking office in February and has urged Washington to hold direct talks with Pyongyang. U.S. officials have refused to hold bilateral meetings with North Korea, favoring multilateral talks that would include North Korea's neighbors. Japanese military officials said Tuesday that North Korea had fired a missile with a range of about 60 kilometers (40 miles), from the northwestern coast of the peninsula. But Japan later backtracked. ``We have information about the missile but we have no confirmation,'' Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. ``We are still trying to confirm it.'' In 1998, North Korea fired a long-range missile that flew over Japan and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. It is believed to possess missiles that could reach parts of the United States. North Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early March. Washington and South Korea have criticized the tests as attempts to force the United States into direct talks.
