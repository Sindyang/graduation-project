THE OIL FIELDS: Firefighters resumed efforts Tuesday to extinguish the remaining two blazes at sabotaged oil wells in Iraq's Rumeila South oil field. A shortage of water on Monday hindered a team from Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control, while Kuwaiti firefighters were unable to contain a fire at a damaged well head nearby. Rumeila South, just north of the Kuwait-Iraq border, is one of Iraq's biggest oil fields. The number of oil well fires there has dwindled to two from seven. Firefighters still hope to put out the last two fires within a week. Some Iraqis who previously worked at Rumeila South were returning to ask for their jobs back and were being screened by the military, said Boots &amp; Coots president, Brian Krause. Once the last fires are beaten, U.S. firefighters plan to replace the field's damaged well heads. Then they expect to move on to other oil fields, including some near Basra, Iraq's No. 2 city, and the northern oil center of Kirkuk _ once allied troops secure those areas. Kirkuk is the nation's No. 2 oil-producing region after the Rumeila fields. THE MARKET: Crude oil futures fell early Tuesday, after a strong finish the previous day.
