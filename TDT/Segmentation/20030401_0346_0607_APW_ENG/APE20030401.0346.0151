Rock star Mark Knopfler has canceled his British tour following a motorbike accident in which he broke six ribs and a collar bone, his agent said Tuesday. Publicist Judy Shaw of Mercury Records said the Dire Straits front man has canceled eight shows, scheduled June 2-9, because of the injuries he sustained in the March 17 crash. ``Owing to injuries sustained in his recent motorbike accident, and acting on medical advice, Mark Knopfler has reluctantly been forced to cancel all shows on his proposed tour,'' Shaw said in a statement. ``Mark is obviously bitterly disappointed and would like to thank the fans who have sent him get well messages,'' she said, adding that ticket holders would be refunded. Knopfler was knocked from his Honda bike when it collided with a Fiat Punto in Belgravia, central London. The female driver of the Fiat was reported to be unhurt. A leading exponent of the moody rock lament and one of the world's most respected guitarists, Knopfler has penned a series of hit songs, including ``Love Over Gold,'' ``Sultans of Swing,'' ``Romeo and Juliet'' and ``Brothers in Arms'' that have won Dire Straits an ardent international following. His most recent production was the solo album, ``The Ragpicker's Dream.'' In 1999, Knopfler was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE. (ej-mm)
