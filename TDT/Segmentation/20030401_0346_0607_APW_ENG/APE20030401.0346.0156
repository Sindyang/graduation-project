Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with prices edging higher in Tokyo but slipping in Hong Kong. Japan's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,986.72. On Monday, the index lost 307.45 points, or 3.71 percent. The Nikkei index eked out gains in a seesaw session marking the first day of Japan's fiscal year. Blue chips Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, TDK, Japan Telecom and NTT DoCoMo led the rebound, which traders attributed to bargain hunting following a dizzying drop Monday of almost 4 percent. Market sentiment remained subdued, however, as investors were discouraged by growing pessimism over the prospects for the war in Iraq. A central bank survey released Tuesday morning showed business sentiment among major Japanese manufacturers worsened in the January-March quarter as worries grew that falling stock prices and the war in Iraq may hurt economic recovery. In currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.04 yen, down 0.98 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below the 118.14 yen in late New York trading overnight. In Hong Kong, the key Hang Seng Index slipped 37.56 points, or 0.44 percent, to 8,596.89, its lowest close since October 1998. On Monday, the index had fallen 228.91 points, or 2.58 percent. Shares slumped early in the session on rumors _ later denied _ that the Hong Kong government would declare the territory an infected area because of the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which has killed 15 people and sickened 610 others here. Prices recouped most of their losses late in the afternoon after the government denied the rumors.
