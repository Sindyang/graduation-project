A Russian doctor said Tuesday that he has launched an effort to bring wounded children out of Iraq and urged the United States to cooperate with the initiative, which would require a temporary halt to attacks on Baghdad and Basra. Leonid Roshal, an emergency pediatrician who said he was involved in operations to evacuate civilians during the conflicts in the Balkans and Afghanistan, told a news conference that the children of Iraq are ``in a cauldron'' because of the war. ``When we thought about this, it was clear that help was needed,'' he said. Roshal, who is working alongside the Russian Red Cross on the evacuation effort, said the idea was his and did not come from the Kremlin, but that President Vladimir Putin has expressed support. Putin has sharply criticized the U.S.-led war, saying it could cause a humanitarian catastrophe. Roshal wants to conduct a broad evacuation campaign, but he said the first step would be to try to remove wounded children from Baghdad and Basra. They could be treated in Russia and other countries and return to Iraq after the war. Iraq's ambassador to Russia, Abbas Khalaf, made a blunt statement last week saying that Iraq does not need humanitarian aid, but Roshal said he later received Khalaf's support for the initiative. Roshal said he was told by the Iraqi embassy that there were 95 wounded children in hospitals, but he said the figure should be verified by international organizations. He said he met Friday with U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow who conveyed his request to Washington, but that he had not yet received an answer. ``It would be a very big mistake if they refuse,'' Roshal said. A U.S. Embassy official confirmed Roshal had asked for U.S. assistance in getting to Baghdad and getting children out safely, and that the request was forwarded to Washington. The official said Roshal indicated the plan was to remove seriously injured children in need of sophisticated treatment. Roshal said the initiative would require a halt to hostilities in the cities involved. ``If America says, for instance, from 1800 hours to 2400 hours we will not bomb,'' then children could be evacuated, he said. It was not yet clear what exit routes would be used under the plan, which Roshal said needs support from international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. ICRC representatives in Moscow were very cautious in an initial meeting, Roshal said, and he and Russian Red Cross director Tatyana Nikolayenko plan to fly Wednesday to Geneva for talks at the organization's headquarters. On Monday, they plan to meet with U.N. agencies in New York to discuss setting up an international committee on evacuating children. (sbg/mb)
