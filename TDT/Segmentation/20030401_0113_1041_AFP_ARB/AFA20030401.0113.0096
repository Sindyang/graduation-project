Foreign  ministry  spokesman  Richard  Boucher  said  that  Powell, who  have  suffered  criticism  because  of  lack  of  carrying  out with  a  greater  number  of  visits  to  mobilize  support  for the  war  being  waged  by  the  United  States  on  Iraq,  left Washington  5.30  hours  a.m.  local  time  (10.30  GMT).
