Indonesia's defence ministry Tuesday defended a policy document which calls for the military's close scrutiny of civilian affairs to be maintained. The "territorial function", which entails the presence of military posts alongside civilian posts down to village level, was blamed for the armed forces' domination of civil affairs during the autocratic rule of president Suharto. Defence ministry spokesman Abdul Azis denied that the maintenance of the territorial function would undermine efforts at military reform. The white paper, launched on Monday, focuses on strategies to maintain Indonesia's territorial integrity, Azis said. There is strong separatist sentiment in Aceh and Papua provinces. Azis said the territorial role was necessary for the military to deal with internal threats such as terrorism, separatism, radicalism and transnational crimes. "Because of our lack of resources in terms of funding and technology, our doctrine is defence by the whole population. Therefore, soldiers need to be close to the people," Azis said. Azis said the military is committed to reform. "We want the military to be professional and not involved in practical politics." There has also been recent controversy over a provision in a bill which would authorise the armed forces chief to deploy troops during an emergency without prior approval from the president. Although President Megawati Sukarnoputri is seen as close to the military, it has lost influence since Suharto's departure in 1998. Next year it loses its reserved seats in parliament. Political analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar, quoted by the Jakarta Post, said a close relationship between the military and civilians "creates negative influences for the soldiers because civilians have different values which often contradict military values, especially in dealing with political and business matters." Rizal Sukma of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said the territorial function was not the answer to separatist issues. "What we need is a development of the defence force that enables us to deal with various external threats." tn/sm/rcw Indonesia-military
