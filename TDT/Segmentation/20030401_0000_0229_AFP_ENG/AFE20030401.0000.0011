Indonesian Satellite Corp (Indosat) has reported a fall in net profit last year of nearly 70 percent to 336.25 billion rupiah (37.8 million dollars) but its president said the fundamentals remained strong. The profit, reported late Monday by the international call operator, fell due to goodwill amortisation, provisions for doubtful debts and tax charges. The company booked sales of 6.77 trillion rupiah last year, up from 5.138 trillion in 2001, while operating profit increased to 1.911 trillion from 1.828 trillion. Indosat president Widya Purnama told financial newswire AFX-Asia the net profit fall was basically driven by non-operating items arising from the restructuring in the telecommunications sector. Purnama referred to the termination of the cross-ownership deal between Indosat and PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Telkom) in a number of subsidiaries which among other things resulted in Indosat's acquisition of Telkom's stake in mobile phone unit Satelindo. "This net profit fall does not really matter to me because our fundamentals remain strong," he said. Purnama said Indosat would continue to rely on the cellular business as the major revenue contributor but would also try to contain the decline in international direct dialling revenue. Separately domestic call operator Telkom late Monday reported a near doubling in net profit to 8.35 trillion rupiah in 2002 on the back of stronger operating income and gains from sale of investments. The company booked an operating profit of 9.40 trillion rupiah, up from 7.62 trillion in 2001, on sales of 21.40 trillion against 15.13 trillion. bur/sm/bro Indonesia-telecom-company-results
