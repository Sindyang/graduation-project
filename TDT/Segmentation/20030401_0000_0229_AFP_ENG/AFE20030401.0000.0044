Indonesians in several cities staged another day of street protests on Tuesday against the US-led attack on Iraq, with some targeting US-franchised fast food chains. About 1,000 young people protested at Palembang in South Sumatra, handing out leaflets and displaying anti-war posters. Police said they were supporters of Muhammadiyah, the country's second largest Muslim organisation. At Semarang in Central Java about 50 students pulled down a Kentucky Fried Chicken sign. Police and security guards thwarted an attempt to topple a McDonald's sign. At Makassar in South Sulawesi, members of the Indonesian Muslim Student Association held an anti-war protest in front of the Japanese consulate, ElShinta radio said. Two representatives met consulate staff to air their objections to Tokyo's backing for the US invasion. Indonesia has seen daily protests since the attack began. The government has strongly criticised the war. bs/sm/mfc Iraq-war-demos-Indonesia
