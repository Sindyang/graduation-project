A Philippine crewman was killed when two foreign oil tankers collided off China's southern coast, the China Daily said Tuesday. The accident occurred over the weekend when a Maltese tanker was taking on oil from a Singaporean vessel off Dapeng Bay near the city of Shenzhen in southern China, the paper quoted a local maritime administrative bureau source as saying. Three others were injured. They were taken to a hospital in nearby Hong Kong. The accident caused fires and a small amount of oil leakage into the bay. Almost 30,000 tons of oil was scheduled to be transferred between the two vessels. The 30,000-ton Maltese "Byzantio" was seriously damaged but the Singaporean "Asian Progress II" was able to leave the area. cs/mfc China-ship
