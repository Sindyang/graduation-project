AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and children at a checkpoint shooting in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, undermining efforts to win over the Iraqi people and counter international concern over the war. The shooting came after a night of intense bombardments on Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace complex in the Iraqi capital came under fresh bombardment on Tuesday for the second consecutive day, an AFP reporter said, with US missiles hitting a major symbol of Saddam's grip on power. The palace grounds have been a frequent target in the bombing. The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said at operational heaquarters in Qatar. He said the victims, seven women and children, were in a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. "As a last resort, they (US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," Owens said, adding that an investigation had been opened. "When soldiers opened the vehicle they found 13 women and children inside. Seven of the occupants were dead, two were wounded and four were unharmed." US forces have been on an increased state of alert following a suicide car-bombing, also near Najaf, on Saturday that killed four US soldiers. A written statement issued by US Central Command said "initial reports indicate the soldiers responded in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life," it said. The incident was expected to fuel vocal international opposition to the 13-day-old war, which the United States says it is waging with a constant eye on keeping civilian casualties to a minimum. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments on Baghdad saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing late Monday. Villagers on the edge of the capital reported 20 more civilians dead, 11 of them children, from the blitz. AFP reporters said the raids were growing more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. The ominous whistle of the missiles was heard in the sky before a series of explosions shook the city, appearing to knock out electricity in entire neighbourhoods. Balls of smoke slowly merged into a single cloud overhead. Two missiles were seen smashing into Saddam's sprawling presidential compound along the banks of the Tigris River, which had aleady been pounded earlier Monday. In a television interview with US network ABC, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal urged Saddam to step down as a "sacrifice for his country." "If his staying in power (is) the only thing that brings problems to his country, we expect that he would respond to a sacrifice for his country, as he requires any citizen there to," he said. South of the capital, US troops massing for a decisive push towards Saddam's seat of power reported their first serious fighting with Iraq's crack Republican Guard, considered Saddam's most determined military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came as US armoured units finalised plans for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near Najaf, to the south. The US army's elite 101st Airborne Division clashed with Iraqi forces near the town, with Apache and Kiowa Warrior helicopters backing ground troops and striking military targets in and around the Shiite Muslim holy city. US President George W. Bush said the day of victory was drawing closer. "Many dangers lie ahead, but day by day we are moving closer to Baghdad. Day by day, we are moving closer to victory," he said at a ceremony in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In Basra, seen as key to controling southeast Iraq, British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making a final push to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers to the southeast of Basra, as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London said a British soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war. US authorities say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri said that some 5,000 Arab volunteers were ready to commit suicide attacks against coalition troops. But US General Vincent Brooks dismissed the threats, telling reporters at the US Central Command's forward base in Qatar: "It's not a very effective military tactic at all. It's a terror tactic and it won't be effective." burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap
