Business confidence falls in Bank of Japan's Tankan survey by Jonathan Annells ATTENTION - ADDS small companies' outlook, analyst's comment, UPDATES stocks close /// TOKYO, April 1 (AFP) - The Bank of Japan (BoJ) said Tuesday its latest Tankan survey showed business confidence had fallen in the past three months and economists warned the full impact of the war in Iraq was still to be felt. The large manufacturers' index slipped one point to minus 10, although the index of large non-manufacturers improved slightly to minus 14 from minus 16, the central bank said in its January-March survey. The indices measure the difference between firms saying economic conditions are favorable and those saying they are unfavorable. A negative figure means a majority of firms see economic conditions as unfavorable. It was the first downturn in the confidence index for large manufacturers since the three months to December 2001. Economists had predicted a slight improvement, with the forecast for large manufacturers seen at minus eight. They were also wrong-footed by the large non-manufacturers' index, which was forecast to come in at minus 17. Capital expenditure by all non-financial companies in the financial year to March just ended was seen falling by 6.6 percent, compared with the 4.8 percent decline shown in the December Tankan. "The survey overall showed the economy was levelling off. What is alarming is that an improvement among large manufacturers, who had led the recent recovery of business confidence, has come to a halt," said Toshio Sumitani, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Centre. Sumitani said the signs of improvement in the economy had waned and the impact of the US-led war in Iraq was still to be fully factored in. "The survey this time might include negative impacts from the war to a certain extent amid the fears of a looming military strike, but I do not think companies polled expected the war could drag on like this." A BoJ spokesman said about 90 percent of companies surveyed had responded before the outbreak of war. Despite the weakening in large manufacturers' sentiment, the number of companies that believe they have excess capacity declined, and fewer large firms said they felt they had excessive inventories or staff, the central bank survey found. "This time around it's very noticeable that all the measures of the state of the economy improved, yet the large manufacturers' sentiment went down, which tells you that a non-economic factor came in somewhere," said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING. "The problems with Iraq and North Korea did hurt sentiment," he said, referring to the nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. Looking ahead, both major sectors surveyed said they saw an improvement in the three months to June, according to the central bank. Business sentiment for large manufacturers is forecast to improve to minus eight in the June Tankan and the large non-manufacturers is seen at minus 13. "What struck me as a surprise was both sectors' sentiment improved (for the June quarter)... companies are not so pessimistic about the future," said Teruo Ikeda, economist at UFJ Institute. Conditions at small firms look set to worsen over the next quarter, however, according to the survey. Daiwa Institute of Research senior economist Junichi Makino said protracted military action in Iraq may pose serious a downside risk for corporate activity. "The respondents apparently did not take into account the risk of prolonged military action in Iraq in the latest survey, as such a view began to emerge just recently," Makino said. The survey was virtually ignored in the foreign exchange and equity markets. Dealers said investors were also more worried about a protracted US-led war against Iraq. Tokyo share prices closed up 0.18 percent after opening lower. As a detailed study of Japanese businesses and their plans for the months ahead, the quarterly Tankan survey is the central bank's key source of data for planning. bur-ja/dv Japan-confidence
