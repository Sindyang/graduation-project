Despite being a staunch US ally in Asia, Japan got a tongue lashing for prisoner abuse and human trafficking in a human rights report released by the US government Monday. Prisons' use of leather restraining devices, which resulted in the death by abdominal injuries of a 49-year-old inmate in May 2002, received prominent treatment in the 16-page section on Japan's human rights situation compiled by the US State Department. The report appeared to be written before Japan's Justice Ministry decided in March it would ban the punitive restraints, effective from September. "There continued to be credible reports that police and prison officials physically and psychologically abused prisoners and detainees," the report said. "Officials sometimes were dismissed for such abuse but were seldom tried, convicted, and imprisoned," it said. In December three prison warders were indicted for the death, along with five arrests in a separate incident, the report noted. "Physical restraints, such as leather belts with attached leather manacles, continued to be used as a form of punishment, and some prisoners were forced to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints," it said. The State Department also pointed out that "violence against women and children, child prostitution, and trafficking in women were problems." It noted the lack of protection for women brought to Japan to work as prostitutes, mostly from Thailand, the Philippines and former Soviet Union, adding that government figures "may understate" the extent of the problem. Few have ever been prosecuted for trafficking, and as for the victims brought to the attention of authorities, "generally they were deported as illegal aliens," the report said. rn/ja/sdm/mfc US-rights-Japan
