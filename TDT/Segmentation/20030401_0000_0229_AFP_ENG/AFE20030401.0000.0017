The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday on possible dollar-buying intervention by Tokyo while investors all but ignored data showing worsening Japanese business confidence, dealers said. The greenback was quoted at 118.24 yen around 1:30 pm (0430 GMT), up from 118.15 yen in New York late Monday. Earlier the US unit dropped to a low of 117.78 yen in Tokyo due to rising concern over a protracted US-led war against Iraq. "Investors did not take the Tankan results as a lead in the market. They were more concerned about the possibility of a long war in Iraq and its impact on the US economy," said Masato Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings. The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showed business confidence among large manufacturers declined to minus 10 in the three months to March from minus nine in the previous quarter, and sentiment among large non-manufacturers improved slightly to minus 14 from minus 16. The dollar later climbed from the 117-yen level as investors speculated the BoJ, under the direction of the finance ministry, intervened in the market to prop up the dollar. "A major trust bank was buying lots of dollars. Maybe this could be dollar-buying intervention" on behalf of the Japanese authorities, Imai said. Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa suggested earlier Tuesday that Tokyo would intervene to halt severe fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. "If we see rapid movements in the market, we will intervene," Shiokawa told reporters. But gains in the dollar were limited due to growing worry over the duration of the war. "Investors were concerned that a prolonged war could start hurting US economic fundamentals," said Hideyuki Tsukamoto, dealer at Mizuho Bank. The euro was firmer, buying 1.0910 dollars at about 1:30 pm, against 1.0902 dollars in New York Monday afternoon. Against the yen, the euro traded at 129.10, compared with 128.81 in New York. Barclays Capital in Singapore said developments in the Iraqi battlefield at the weekend still weighed on the dollar as they "did nothing to shake the market's growing perception that the war may be of far longer duration and intensity than was previously assumed." Soft economic data from the US also added to the bearish picture for the dollar, it said. In early afternoon trade in Singapore, the dollar rose to 1.7668 Singapore dollars from 1.7645 the previous day and 8,905 Indonesian rupiah from 8,902. The greenback fell to 53.35 Philippine peso from 53.57, 34.7579 Taiwan dollars from 34.7645 and 1,253.45 South Korean won from 1,259.05. It was unchanged at 42.865 Thai baht. shi-bur/ja/dv Forex-Asia
