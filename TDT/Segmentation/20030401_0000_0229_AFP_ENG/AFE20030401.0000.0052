Malaysian police have detained an Australian musician for allegedly engaging in "unnatural sex" with a local sailor and videotaping the act, a report said Tuesday. Magistrate Hazizah Kassim Monday remanded the Australian in custody for five days for the alleged act of gross indecency, The Star newspaper said. If convicted he could be jailed for up to two years. The 35-year-old sailor said he met the unnamed Australian, described in the newspaper as "a sub-principal of an orchestra", via the Internet, The Star said. The two men agreed to meet at a hotel here last Friday and the sailor was invited to a house where he was given a drink, after which he alleges he became semi-conscious. He said that during this time he was sexually assaulted and the act was videotaped. The sailor said that when he regained consciousness the following morning he demanded 50,000 ringgit (13,000 dollars) to "solve the problem," the newspaper reported. When the Australian refused to pay, he reported the incident to the police. Australian deputy high commissioner Nick Brown confirmed to AFP that an Australian had been detained but declined to elaborate. str/lb/rcw Malaysia-Australia-sex
