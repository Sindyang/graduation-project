Hundreds of residents isolated after the outbreak of a deadly respiratory illness in a Hong Kong residential complex may be removed to a government quarantine centre, a legislator said Tuesday. Democratic Party lawmaker Li Wah-ming said the government would remove all residents to a quarantine centre if the outbreak at the 33-story Amoy Gardens residential complex was not soon brought under control. "A quarantine centre has been already been prepared," Li told reporters after meeting with director of health Margaret Chan and flat owners from the Amoy Gardens complex located on Kowloon peninsula. Four holiday camps under the management of the government's Leisure and Cultural Service Department, with a combined capacity of 1,050 people, are reportedly being considered. Chan was not immediately available for further comment Tuesday, but it appeared the administration was preparing for an all out assault on the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic which has so far killed 15 in Hong Kong and infected at least another 610. The revised death toll was announced after authorities on Monday took the extraordinary step of ordering a 264-unit block of the Amoy Gardens housing complex isolated until midnight April 9. But a health department spokeswoman told AFP Tuesday there were only some 240 residents in 108 units when the quarantine order was put in place, and that authorities had little information on the whereabouts of tenants from another 156 units who have reportedly fled. Health chief Yeoh Eng-kiong told reporters Monday that investigations by Hong Kong University had discovered the virus could be detected in the faeces of patients. He said the authorities were studying if the Amoy Gardens outbreak was related to a waste water mains at the estate which had recently burst. The public housing estate was sealed late Monday by around 50 police officers wearing white masks who set up barricades around the buildings. Health workers also set up a temporary clinic to monitor health and the authorities will supply isolated residents with food until the quarantine order is lifted. The measure was taken after 185 residents in the block came down with the flu-like symptoms of SARS, including 64 who were diagnosed on Monday. During the isolation period, no one will be allowed to enter or leave the premises without the express permission of a health officer. Anybody who violated the isolation order would face a fine of 5,000 Hong Kong dollars (850 US) and six months in jail. A quarantine law invoked by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa last Thursday as part of tougher measures to contain the virus, which included the closure of all schools until April 6, also took effect on Monday. Hong Kong authorities have meanwhile called on passengers who travelled on Thai Airways flight TG 606 from Bangkok to Hong Kong on March 29 to contact the territory's health department. The call follows the admission of a passenger on that flight to Princess Margaret Hospital with suspected SARS soon after his arrival in Hong Kong. The mysterious illness has now infected more than 1,700 people in 15 countries. According to a tally compiled by AFP, the worldwide death toll from SARS stands at 62, with 34 deaths in China, 15 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. hw/pch Health-pneumonia-HongKong-quarantine
