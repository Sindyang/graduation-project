South Korea posted a trade deficit for the third straight month in March due to higher oil import costs amid the war in Iraq, government statistics showed Tuesday. The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said the country's customs-cleared trade account was 362 million dollars in the red last month, compared with 1.26 billion dollars in black a year ago. The trade account for the first three months to March showed a 840 million dollar accumulated deficit with the shortfalls of 375 million dollars of February and 102 million dollars of January, it added. The ministry attributed the trade deficits largely to rising oil prices which had been already volatile even before the ongoing US-led war in Iraq. "The trade account has recorded three straight months of shortfalls as imports are growing at a faster rate on higher oil prices," it said. "But it could turn to a surplus again should oil prices fall to below 30 dollars, even if the US-led war against Iraq is prolonged." In March, exports rose 17.5 percent year-on-year to 15.57 billion dollars while imports jumped 32.9 percent year-on-year to 27.75 billion dollars. Ministry statistics showed the country's spending for oil imports stood at 2.45 billion dollars in March, up 66 percent from a year ago. In March, handset and automobile exports were brisk, while semiconductors and computer shipments dropped on a weaker IT industry, they showed. Semiconductor exports dropped for the first time in 12 months due to falls in memory chip prices to 1.33 billion dollars in March, down 7.3 percent from a year earlier. bur/jkw/dv SKorea-economy-trade
