Sprinter Jodie Henry on Tuesday quit the Australian team for this weekend's swimming meet in the United States blaming a fear of flying there during the Iraq war. The national team was informed of Henry's withdrawal as it prepared to fly out for Indianapolis where it will take on a full-strength American team on Sunday. The 19-year-old Commonwealth 100m freestyle champion left the team camp here after lengthy discussions with officials who outlined stringent security precautions late Monday. "She (Henry) has shown a genuine fear of flying to the USA in the current climate," a team spokesman said on Tuesday. "There were long, convoluted discussions and meetings last night with her parents in the team camp ... Still this morning we were hopeful she would come to the airport but it didn't happen." The team was told of Henry's decision at a morning meeting with Australian Swimming high performance director Greg Hodge, men's coach Brian Sutton and women's coach Scott Volkers. Hodge was confident the late withdrawal would not disrupt the team's focus before the clash with the US, the warm-up event for July's world championship in Barcelona. "There was some very strong resolve and we are ready to see this through," said Hodge. Hodge said Henry was still expected to contest the world championships in Spain. The team had already been disrupted by the withdrawal of seven key members including multi-world champion and record holder Ian Thorpe because of injury and illness. Australian Swimming chief executive officer Glenn Tasker and security chief Bob Myers addressed a meeting of swimmers, coaches and parents on their US plans on the eve of the team's departure. rsm/rcw Swim-AUS-USA
