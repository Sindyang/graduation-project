Malaysia is free from the killer pneumonia virus which has hit neighbouring Singapore and other Asian countries hard as it spreads worldwide, officials said Tuesday. "Malaysia is free from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)," a senior official with the health ministry told AFP. "There are no confirmed cases or deaths caused by SARS in the country," he said. Health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif said there had been "41 notifications to our operations centres from March 18 until Sunday" but all patients had been found to be free of SARS. The virus causing SARS, a mystery respiratory illness which first erupted in southern China and has been transported to North America and Europe by travellers, has yet to be identified by scientists. The Malaysian health ministry official urged the public to remain calm and avoid travel to affected countries. "If you are going to Singapore, please wear a face mask and avoid visiting SARS patients," he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. Singapore is among the worst hit, with four deaths and the number of reported cases now standing at 92, with 47 in hospital and 41 discharged so far. Malaysia's Health Minister Chua Jui Meng was in the southern Johor state bordering Singapore Tuesday to inspect measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. "There should be more personnel at the entry points, not so much to prevent people from coming in but to advise those who have visible symptoms of SARS to seek medical advice as soon as possible," he said. Asked what the government would do in relation to a Singaporean women who died Monday after she returned from a visit to Malaysia's eastern Sarawak state, the health official said the government was seeking further information on the case from Singapore. He said all hospitals had set up isolation wards to cater for anyone suspected of having SARS and that a public awareness campaign had been launched. jsm/lb/pch Malaysia-health-pneumonia
