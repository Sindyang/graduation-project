Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) said Tuesday its wholly-owned subsidiary Singapore Post (SingPost) plans to raise 300 million Singapore dollars (169.50 million US) through a bond issue. Proceeds from the 10-year unsecured bonds will be used by the postal operator to fund operations, anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements, SingTel said in a statement. DBS Bank and UBS AG will manage the bond issue. The Standard and Poor's ratings agency has assigned an A-plus preliminary rating to the proposed bond issue subject to final documentation and pricing, SingTel said in a statement. SingPost is the dominant provider of domestic and international postal services in the city-state. SingTel also said Monday it plans to list SingPost but has yet to determine the size and pricing of the initial public offering. SingPost reported a net profit of 101 million Singapore dollars in the year to March 2002, on revenue of 381 million dollars. mba/rc/dv Singapore-post-telecom-bonds-company
