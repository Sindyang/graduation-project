Hong Kong's companies are doing all they can to keep the corporate wheels turning despite a deadly virus outbreak, including having staff work from home and opening back-up offices away from infected sites. Hong Kong is the centre of the global outbreak severe acute respiratory sydndrome (SARS), which has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62. After breaking out in neighbouring Guangdong province in southern China, the virus spread to Hong Kong, where 15 people have died and at least 610 have been infected. In most offices business is continuing as usual, despite the wide adoption of surgical masks, which make many workplaces look more like hospital wards. But some firms have had to adopt innovative measures to ensure their staff and businesses remain healthy. Global banking giant HSBC has told 50 of its staff in its capital markets and treasury department to work from home for a week, while another worksite is prepared for them. An HSBC teller was diagnosed with SARS last week. Vinh Tram, spokeswoman for HSBC Holdings plc, said the priority was to ensure operations could continue without interruption. "We have contingency plans in case of emergency, including creating a backup team," she said. Other firms have also had to arrange for staff to work from home after one of their workers has been found to be suffering from the virus. Dao Heng Bank, owned by Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings, said a staff member based in its customer centre has been diagnosed with SARS. Medical check-ups have been arranged for all staff members who may have been in contact with the employee and they have been told to stay at home in the meantime, spokeswoman Angel Lin said. "We have a back-up team to ensure minimal disruption to operations," said Lin. In common with many other companies, Dao Heng's parent DBS Group has suspended all business travel for its employees to minimise exposure to SARS. For many businesses, a downturn is inevitable as a result of the outbreak. Many shops and restaurants are suffering a slump as many people try to avoid public places as much as possible. The Grand Hyatt Hotel in has decided to suspend all buffet meal operations at its restaurants. "The well-being of our guests and employees is always of paramount concern," hotel spokeswoman Vivian Wan said. A sudden eruption of cases at the Amoy Gardens estate in Kowloon district prompted the Hong Kong authorities to take the unprecedented measure of ordering the complete isolation of the housing block on Monday. A total of around 200 cases have been uncovered at Amoy Gardens, and several local businesses have also had to close. As a precautionary measures, Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. has decided to close down a branch in the Amoy Gardens complex. "This is just a precautionary measure," said spokeswoman Angel Yip. "We have emergency measures in different departments in case any staff fall ill to the disease, in order to keep business going on," said Yip. Irene Chan, spokeswoman for Walt Disney's Hong Kong operations, said some staff have been allowed to take leave to look after their children after local schools were closed to contain the spread of the virus. There have been reports that some expatriate workers have sent their families home but Chan said Disney's foreign staff continued to report to work. "At the moment, no expatriate staff have asked to return home," said Chan. pl/bro Health-pneumonia-HongKong-firms
