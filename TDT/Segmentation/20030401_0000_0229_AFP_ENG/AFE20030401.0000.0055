Too much red tape has prevented the Rolling Stones from giving Indian fans satisfaction in the past, according to lead singer Mick Jagger. The band are to due to play in India for the first time ever -- in the country's technology capital, Bangalore, on April 4 and the financial hub of Bombay on April 7. "To tell you the truth, India has never been on the regular tour map. It's been quite difficult in the past with the bureaucracy being so much worse than now," Jagger told the Hindustan Times daily. For a rock concert to be held in India the organisers require permission from at least a dozen government departments including three police departments, corporation and federal authorities. The group has just completed the first half of its "40 Licks World Tour" with 50 sell-out gigs in the United States and eight in Australia. But the rock-and-roll band had to cancel shows in Hong Kong and China following a health scare due the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the region. Jagger, who visited in India in 1996 to watch World Cup cricket matches, said the other members of the group were "really, really keen," to perform before Indian audiences. In another interview to the Times of India Jagger, 59 said he had outlasted his contemporaries due to luck. But he said he did not take seriously the knighthood awarded to him last year. "I still have to find time to accept it. From the beginning I have always had friends from all layers of society. Actually, British society is very porous, unlike say French and I have refused to be pigeon-holed," he said. The singer said British singer Robbie Williams was the next kid on the block. "Of course he has stolen a lot from me. But much of it is his own. He is provocative, entertaining... not just a recording artist," he said. jay/er/an/rcw India-music-Stones
