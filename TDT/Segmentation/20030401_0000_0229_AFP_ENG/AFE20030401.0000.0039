A Mexican airliner made a forced landing late Monday in Villahermosa after a passenger threatened to detonate a bomb he claimed he was carrying, Mexican television said. Authorities arrested a man who had been traveling on Aeromexico's Flight 510 from Villahermosa to Mexico City, but said no bomb was found in his possession, the official news agency Notimex said. Authorities inspected the plane which was then allowed to resume its journey to Mexico City. Around half of the 100-120 people on board the aircraft, according to officials' figures, got off the plane when it landed back at Villahermosa. str/gm/jlp/fgf Mexico-air
