Eight communist guerrillas have been killed in a clash north of the Philippine capital, the military said Tuesday. Soldiers, investigating a tip-off from residents, encountered members of the communist New People's Army (NPA) in Dipaculao town, Aurora province, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of Manila on Monday, a military spokesman said. Local residents said they saw the rebels dragging away the bodies of eight of their slain comrades after the fighting. Troops recovered four rifles, eight knapsacks and other supplies from the fallen rebels. The NPA is the armed wing of the underground Communist Party of the Philippines, tagged a terrorist group by the United States. The NPA marked their 34th founding anniversary last Saturday with a call for all guerrillas to step up offensives around the Philippines. On Sunday, at least 20 NPA guerrillas were killed in a gunbattle with the police and military in Bulacan province north of Manila. str/mm/jvg/mfc Philippines-communist
