Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels have denied attacking a troop carrier, raising fresh fears for the island's fragile Norwegian-arranged ceasefire, officials said Tuesday. A Scandinavian team monitoring the ceasefire between government forces and the rebel Tamil Tigers said the guerrillas had denied involvement in the attack late Monday in which three soldiers were wounded. "The LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) says they have nothing to do with this," a spokesman for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission said. The denial raised fears that other militant groups could be operating in an area where the Tigers were thought to be exercising an iron grip control, official sources and diplomats said. The Tigers have also denied any knowledge of the sinking of a Chinese trawler off the island's northeastern coast 12 days ago which killed 17 Chinese crewmen. In Monday's incident, the navy destroyed what it believed was a Tamil Tiger craft that opened fire on a ferry that was taking more than 1,200 government soldiers to the northern peninsula of Jaffna. The navy claimed that an LTTE dinghy emerged from a cluster of fishing boats some 20 kilometres (13 miles) east of the northeastern port of Trincomalee and opened fire on the MV Lanka Muditha, military officials said. They said a navy attack craft that was escorting the troop carrier fired on and destroyed the Tiger vessel. At least two rebels were believed to have been aboard the dinghy. The troop carrier resumed its journey after the attack and reached its destination Tuesday morning. "The navy stepped up security for Lanka Muditha and it safely reached its original destination at Kankesanthurai," a military source said. "We called in additional gun boats to escort the troop carrier." The latest confrontation came three weeks after the Sri Lankan navy sank a LTTE merchant vessel in disputed waters, killing 12 guerrillas. Truce monitors had said they did not have enough evidence to apportion blame, but criticised both for not avoiding the incident. The Norwegian-brokered truce between the rebels and the government has been in place since February 23. At the latest round of peace talks in Japan 11 days ago, both sides agreed to put in place measures to prevent clashes at sea and ensure that the ceasefire is not violated. The Tigers, who have an effective naval unit known as the Sea Tigers, have targeted the Lanka Muditha on several occasions, but troops managed to beat them back. Three decades of ethnic bloodshed in Sri Lanka have claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1972. aj/an/sdm SriLanka-Tamil
