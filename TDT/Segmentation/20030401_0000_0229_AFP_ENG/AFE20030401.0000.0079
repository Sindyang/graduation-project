New Zealand stocks closed 0.35 percent lower Tuesday as investors stayed on the sidelines amid the Iraq war, dealers said. The NZSE50 index was down 6.84 points to 1,924.77 on turnover of 50.62 million dollars (27.45 million US). ABN Amro Craigs retail equities adviser Nigel Scott said that with war raging in Iraq and issues like an electricity shortage, lower dairy payouts and a softening retail outlook emerging locally, investors were sticking to the sidelines. "The broader market just started a new financial quarter and you'd have to say the outlook hasn't really changed," he said. Telecom shed two cents to 4.50 dollars, Auckland International Airport was off seven cents to 5.19 dollars, Carter Holt Harvey dipped a cent to 1.77 dollars, Tranz Rail was off three cents to 95 cents, The Warehouse eased a cent to 5.57 dollars, Contact Energy gained four cents to 4.26 dollars, and Sky City was down a cent at 7.89 dollars. Air New Zealand closed a cent higher at 49 cents after announcing Monday it was cutting its international flights by about three percent due to reduce forward bookings following the Iraq war and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. Horizon Energy bounced 25 cents to 2.95 dollars on light volume and Powerco was four cents higher at 1.42 dollars after the Commerce Commission's much-awaited decision on regulating power line companies was released Monday. mjf/dv Stocks-NZealand
