Indonesia Tuesday announced increased measures to prevent the entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) into the country, including tighter checks on incoming travellers. Health minister Achmad Suyudi and senior officials attended a meeting at the office of top welfare minister Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially deadly infection. Indonesia has no known SARS cases despite its proximity to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases including four deaths. "We have, in coordination with the health ministry, stepped up surveillance of passengers arriving from overseas, especially from countries where SARS has developed, at all main ports of entry, air or sea," said an immigration department spokesman, Ade Endang Dahlan. He said immigration staff are wearing masks and incoming passengers must fill in a health form. Staff are watching arriving passengers for symptoms. "Any suspicious cases will be set apart by quarantine officials and if they are ascertained to be carrying the disease, we will deport them to their country of departure as the law stipulates," he said. So far there has been no report of such cases, he said. The number of ferry passengers between Indonesia's Batam island and nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 percent, the state Antara news agency said. The health ministry said no cases of SARS have been detected in Indonesia. It has opened special phone lines for inquiries and briefed hospitals across the country on the disease. A 17-year-old Indonesian student in Singapore has contracted SARS after visiting Guangdong and Hong Kong with his brother and parents. An Indonesian embassy spokesman in Singapore, quoted by Antara, said they had also been told that an Indonesian crew member had died -- possibly of SARS -- on a voyage from Hong Kong to Singapore. The virus has killed 60 people worldwide and infected 1,700. bs/sm/mfc Health-pneumonia-Indonesia
