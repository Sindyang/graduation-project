The round-the-clock onslaught on Baghdad continued Tuesday with a dozen US cruise missiles bombarding the Iraqi capital as Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard faced their first significant battle with coalition forces on the ground. US forces also shot dead seven women and children after the civilian vehicle in which they were traveling failed to stop at a military checkpoint south of Baghdad. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal urged Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to step down as a "sacrifice for his country", and in southern Iraq British forces attacked the outskirts of the port city of Basra. For the 12th day running, intense bombardments pounded the outskirts of Baghdad, where four divisions of the Republican Guard were hunkered down to defend the capital from any ground attack by US and British forces. AFP reporters said the raids were growing more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. Warplanes hit Baghdad and its southern outskirts, with two missiles crashing into Saddam's sprawling Republican Palace compound, the first such strike in broad daylight. In a television interview with an American station, Faisal said that since Saddam had "asked his people to sacrifice for the country ... he should be the first to sacrifice for his country. "If his staying in power (is) the only thing that brings problems to his country, we expect that he would respond to a sacrifice for his country, as he requires any citizen there to." South of the capital, US troops massing for a decisive push towards Saddam's seat of power reported their first serious fighting with Iraq's crack Republican Guard, considered Saddam's most determined military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came as US armored units finalized plans for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) to the south. The US army's elite 101st Airborne Division clashed with Iraqi forces near Najaf, with Apache and Kiowa Warrior helicopters backing ground troops and striking military targets in and around the Shiite Muslim holy city. US President George W. Bush said the day of victory was drawing closer. "Many dangers lie ahead, but day by day we are moving closer to Baghdad. Day by day, we are moving closer to victory," he said at a ceremony in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In Basra, seen as a key to controling southeast Iraq, British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making a final push to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers backed by tanks and armored vehicles were battling to punch through the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast of Basra, as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. US and British military sources put the death toll at 26 British and at least 39 US soldiers killed since the start of the war on March 20. The British defence ministry announced the latest death of one of its soldiers early Tuesday, saying only he had died "in the course of his duties" in southern Iraq. Three US troops were wounded Monday, one seriously, after Iraqi soldiers used a Red Crescent ambulance to stage an attack at a town north of Nasiriyah. Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri reiterated that some 5,000 Arab volunteers were ready to commit suicide attacks against coalition troops, emulating an Iraqi who killed four US soldiers in a car bomb attack near Najaf in central Iraq on Saturday. But US General Vincent Brooks dismissed the threats, telling reporters at the US Central Command's forward base in Qatar: "It's not a very effective military tactic at all. It's a terror tactic and it won't be effective." Despite the increase in fighting on several fronts, Britain acknowledged that coalition forces had not captured any top leaders or uncovered any of the weapons of mass destruction that Washington and London have accused Saddam of harboring. British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon said the coalition was holding 8,000 Iraqi prisoners of war. But the United States has no intention of sending Iraqi prisoners to the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where the United States is accused of mistreating prisoners captured in Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokeswoman, Navy Lieutenant Commander Barbara Burfeind, said: "It is far too early in the conflict to make any decision regarding the future of those individuals who have come under the control of coalition forces. "But the US does not intend sending these EPWs (enemy prisoners of war) to Guantanamo." The US military's forward command center in Qatar also said US marines had seized a huge Iraqi ammunition supply depot in south-central Iraq, including ammunition, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and other weapons. Syria and Iran hit back at US allegations that they were backing terrorist groups, with Tehran attributing the comments to setbacks for the coalition on the battlefield. On a lighter note, US girlie magazine Playboy threw its weight behind the war effort by deploying its Playmate centrefolds to boost battlefield morale. Los Angeles-based Playboy, the world's oldest skin magazine, said it was launching "Operation Playmate" to help perk up troops by allowing them to e-mail the centrefolds who will send back autographed photos of themselves. burs/dab Iraq-worldwrap
