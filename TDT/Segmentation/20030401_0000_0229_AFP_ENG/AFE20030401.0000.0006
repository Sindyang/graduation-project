Vietnam's human rights record for 2002 received poor marks from the US State Department, which in a report Monday detailed violence by security forces and continuing persecution of the country's ethnic minorities. According to the 2002 annual US State Department report on human rights world-wide, the Vietnamese government "continued to commit serious abuses." "Police sometimes beat suspects during arrests, detention, and interrogation. Several sources also reported that security forces detained, beat, and were responsible for the disappearances of numerous persons during the year. There were reports of killings by authorities," the report stated. In January, local newspapers reported that a man suspected of attacking the home of a village police chief with a grenade was tortured to death while in police custody, the report said. Two police officers were awaiting trial for the man's death, according to the report, but Vietnamese authorities were not immediately available to comment. The State Department also accused the Vietnamese government of continuing to deprive ethnic minorities of civil and religious freedoms following massive protests in the country's Central Highlands in early 2001. "Since 2001 the military has played a large role in the Central Highlands by enforcing restrictions on gatherings, by detaining individuals, and by enforcing travel restrictions," the report said. Based on recent investigations by human rights organizations, the State Department believed, "Hmong Protestant Christians in several northwestern villages and various ethnic minority Protestant Christians in the Central Highlands were pressured or forced to recant their faith." The report also said that despite some loosening of controls on the press, "The freedom to criticize the Communist Party and its highest leadership remained restricted." dla/sdm/mfc Vietnam-US-droits
