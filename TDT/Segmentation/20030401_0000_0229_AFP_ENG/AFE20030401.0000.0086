Pakistan has demanded evidence from the United States to back allegations that it exported nuclear technology to North Korea. "We reject the charges made by the American administration," Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was quoted Tuesday as saying after the United States confirmed that it had imposed sanctions on the A.Q.Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), a uranium enrichment plant south-east of Islamabad. The sanctions -- a two-year trade ban -- were imposed because of KRL's "contributions" to efforts by an unnamed foreign body to develop weapons of mass destruction, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington overnight. Sanctions have also been slapped on North Korea for exporting missile technology, Boucher said. KRL is at the center of months of allegations by unnamed US intelligence officials that Pakistan helped North Korea develop its controversial nuclear weapons program by providing it with designs for uranium-enriching gas centrifuges, in exchange for missiles from Pyongyang. Kasuri told The News daily he was seeking evidence from the US administration to prove the claims of nuclear technology exports. "Our nuclear program is purely for defence and we are not involved in any kind of such proliferation," the minister was quoted as saying. He rejected suggestions that Pakistan was being pressured to curtail its nuclear program, of which KRL is considered the hub, and said Pakistan would never bow to any pressure to roll back the program. "We would not accept any pressure from any source when it comes to meeting our defence needs," Kasuri told reporters. The New York Times has reported that a Pakistani aircraft arrived in Pyongyang as recently as last July to pick up North Korean missile parts -- the payoff in what it said was a "deadly barter" raising disturbing questions about US-Pakistan relations. US Secretary of State Colin Powell has said he was assured by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf that "there are no further contacts" between Islamabad and Pyongyang. But Powell and White House officials have left unanswered questions over alleged links in the past. bc/sdm/rcw Pakistan-US-NKorea
