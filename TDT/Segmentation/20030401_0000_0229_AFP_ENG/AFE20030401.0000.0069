Manchester United, the world's richest soccer club, have announced reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the six months to the end of January. Higher media revenues and more home cup games lifted turnover in the six months to January 31 by 13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (146 million dollars) while operating profits before player sales rose 32 percent to 31.1 million pounds (49 million dollars). However, pre-tax profits were 34 percent lower because the club raked in less cash in transfer market. In the previous period, the club generated 16.3 million pounds from selling Jaap Stam to Italian club Lazio and Andy Cole to English side Blackburn. "We have significantly improved our operating performance," said chief executive Peter Kenyon. "The strength of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United. "Looking ahead, we have a clear strategy focusing on the development of media rights, the conversion of more fans to customers and the leveraging of our global brand." Last month, Kenyon said failure to land a trophy for the second successive season would be unacceptable. United are second to Arsenal in the English Premiership and play nine-times European Cup winners Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals this month. bur/rw03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-profits
