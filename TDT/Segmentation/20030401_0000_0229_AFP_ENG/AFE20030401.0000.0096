France's Societe Generale Group Tuesday said it would establish this week a joint venture fund management with Chinese steel conglomerate Shanghai Baosteel Group. The joint venture unites Societe Generale's fund management group, SG Asset Management Co. (SG AM), and Baosteel's Fortune Trust and Investment Co. in a deal that was officially approved last October. SG AM Management Co., will own 33 percent of the new company headquartered in the eastern city of Shanghai, which plans to begin doing business with a registered capital of 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars). But before Fortune SG AM begins trading its umbrella fund it will seek to raise three billion yuan in capital, the company said. Sino-foreign fund management joint ventures approved in recent weeks, hope to draw on the more than one trillion dollars in China's household savings, largely ildling in domestic banks at annual interest rates of 1.98 percent. Last month ING Group's fund management arm, ING Investment Management and China Merchants Fund Management became the mainland's first group to launch open-ended umbrella funds, including a bond fund, an equity fund, and a fund made up of both financial instruments. Another foreign company that has established a fund management joint venture is fellow Dutch financial group and rival ABN Amro. Allianz, Invesco and Fortis are awaiting final approval to launch their own funds. bms/dv China-SocietyGenerale-France-company-fund
