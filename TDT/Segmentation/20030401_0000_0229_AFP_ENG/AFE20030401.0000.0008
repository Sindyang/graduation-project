The Philadelphia 76ers finally figured out how to guard Tracy McGrady. The 76ers harassed McGrady late in the fourth quarter and overtime while getting big games from Allen Iverson and Kenny Thomas as they clinched their sixth straight playoff berth with a 118-113 victory over the Orlando Magic. Iverson scored a season-high 42 points, including two huge baskets in overtime. He has 46 career 40-point games and the 76ers have won the last 12. Thomas continued his stellar play with 24 points and a season-high 20 rebounds, 12 on the offensive end. But the key to Philadelphia's fourth straight road win was its defence on McGrady, who has supplanted Iverson as the NBA's leading scorer. Over the last seven minutes, the Sixers limited McGrady to one basket and one free throw as they repeatedly chased the ball out of his hands. gph03 Basket-NBA-Iverson
