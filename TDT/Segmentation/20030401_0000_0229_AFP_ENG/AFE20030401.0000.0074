Tuberculosis vaccine administered to babies may make them resistant to developing asthma later in life, Australian researchers said Tuesday. The scientists at Sydney's Woolcock Institute of Medical Research said their study of how early viral infections could protect against allergies later in life raised the possibility of someday developing a vaccine against asthma. Guy Marks, head of epidemiology at the Woolcock Institute, said the research team set out to test whether tuberculosis (TB) vaccinations reduced the incidence of allergies, asthma, eczema and hay fever during childhood. The Sydney test involved two groups of children aged seven to 14, 309 of whom were vaccinated against TB and 442 who were not. The researchers found that asthma rates were lower among members of the vaccinated group, notably among those with a family history of allergies. "In those who had a family history of allergic disease the ones who had the vaccine as a child were less likely to have asthma," Marks said. He said the vaccination did not appear to have any impact on eczema, hay fever or allergies, but the reason for this was unclear. Marks said previous studies of the possible impact of early TB vaccinations on allergies had produced conflicting results. But the latest study "offers some clues" that it may be possible to intervene with the immune system in early life to protect against asthma later on, he said. "It may be possible to give a vaccination that is specifically designed to reduce the risk of asthma," he said. Marks said further research was needed to better understand what it was about the TB vaccine that led to the apparent protection. The research is published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. dm/cl Health-asthma-Australia
