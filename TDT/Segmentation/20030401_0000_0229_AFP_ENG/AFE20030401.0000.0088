Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on Tuesday reiterated after a meeting with US President George W. Bush that the Palestinians had to fight "terrorism" before any implementation of a US-backed international peace plan. "I said clearly there cannot be two parallel paths: the war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night," Shalom told public radio. "The end of terrorism constitutes the central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," he said. Shalom, who was making his first visit to Washington since being named foreign minister last month, met Bush late Monday when the US leader dropped in on talks he was holding with US national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney. He also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. The roadmap is a plan setting out the steps to Palestinian statehood by the year 2005. Based on a Bush speech on the Middle East last June, it was drafted by US, UN, EU and Russian diplomats, but Israel has raised a number of objections. Foremost among its complaints is the fear that the plan might progress from one phase to the next without really tackling the problem of powerful militant groups attacking Israel. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's advisor Dov Weisglass has said he would like a US mechanism to judge when the conditions have been met to move from phase to phase, sidelining the United Nations and European Union, with whom Israel has cool relations. Israel has reportedly proposed 100 changes to the roadmap as drafted, and convinced the United States to delay its publication, despite European objections, until after its January 28 elections. It has since been further delayed as the moderate new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, forms his own cabinet, in a move meant to sideline veteran Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, seen by Israel and Washington as an obstacle to peace. Israeli public radio reported that during their meeting, Bush told Shalom he was "serious" about pressing forward with his roadmap. Citing sources in Washington, the radio said the US administration did not intend to make any changes to the roadmap and that it would be published "as it was". jlr/jh/dab Mideast-Israel-US-roadmap
