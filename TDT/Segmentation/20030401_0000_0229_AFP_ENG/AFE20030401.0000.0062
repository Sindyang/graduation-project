Taiwan share prices rose 0.38 percent Tuesday as bargain-hunting offset declines on Wall Street amid concerns about the Iraq war and a deadly pneumonia virus, dealers said. The weighted index closed up 16.39 points at 4,337.61 on turnover of 30.54 billion Taiwan dollars (879 million US). The electronics sector led the broad market higher on technical factors and bargain-hunting propelled by pre-AGM buying, expectations of solid March sales and probably government support in some stocks such as TSMC and UMC, dealers said. Risers led decliners 319 to 287, with 124 stocks unchanged. "Some institutional investors continued to place sell programmes while some hunted for bargains on technical factors," Yunda Securities Consultant vice president Tom Tang said. "There were also expectations of a technical recovery today after yesterday's steep falls." Chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) closed down 0.10 at 42.20 and United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) was up 0.10 at 19.40, with bargain-hunting and possible government support capping American depository receipt falls. Airlines and hotels, on the other hand, continued to be hit by concern over the SARS outbreak. EVA Airways was down 0.25 at 10.00 after the company announced a 2003 parent net profit target of 2.04 billion Taiwan dollars, down from a profit of 2.64 billion a year earlier. China Airlines was down 0.20 at 11.80 on SARS woes. Compal was up 0.90 at 35.50, Quanta rose 2.50 to 63.50 and Asustek was up 1.50 at 68.00 on pre-AGM buying and possible solid March sales. Ambassador Hotel was down 0.45 at 8.75, Leofoo Development was down 0.40 at 7.75 and Formosa International Hotels was down 0.30 at 34.90 on SARS concern. bur/sl/dv Stocks-Taiwan
