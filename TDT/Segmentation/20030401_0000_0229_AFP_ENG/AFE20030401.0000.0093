A repeat meeting of top-level negotiators who launched an historic China-Taiwan dialogue here 10 years ago has been deferred due to fears of a killer respiratory virus, organisers said Tuesday. The East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore did not give a new date for the meeting, which was originally scheduled for April 7. It was supposed to be the first reunion between Koo Chen-foo of Taiwan and China's Wang Daohan since their historic talks in Singapore in 1993. "It is with much regret that I have to inform you that we have decided to postpone the conference on grounds that Singapore is one of the areas stricken with the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)," said institute director professor Wang Gungwu. "This is a difficult decision that we have to take to safeguard the interest of our speakers and attendees at the conference," Wang said in a letter to AFP. The meeting will be rescheduled at a later date when the situation has improved in Singapore, he said. At least four people have died of SARS in Singapore, with 92 cases reported. The mysterious illness, which manifests itself as an unusual form of pneumonia, has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62. Koo, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang, from the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, first met in a landmark dialogue here from April 27-29, 1993. Now octogenarians, the two represented the two rivals separated in 1949 at the end of a civil war. Beijing has suspended since 1995 a second dialogue between the two elders, angered by a high-profile visit to the United States by then Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui. Academics from the mainland, Taiwan and the United States have also been invited to present papers at the proposed reunion conference in Singapore, a predominantly ethnic Chinese city-state with strong ties to both Beijing and Taipei. mba/rc/cl Health-pneumonia-Singapore-Taiwan-China
