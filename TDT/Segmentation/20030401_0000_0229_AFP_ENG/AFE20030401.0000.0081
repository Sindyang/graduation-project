The Australian sharemarket was largely unmoved Tuesday by falls in global markets, with brokers saying strength in the banking sector offset ongoing concerns about the war in Iraq. The SP/ASX 200 index closed down 3.0 points or 0.10 percent at 2,882.2, while the All Ordinaries index was down 4.4 points at 2,844.2. Market volume was 603.4 million shares worth 2.3 billion dollars (1.38 billion US), with 516 stocks higher, 433 lower and 290 steady. Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri said the defensive nature of the Australian share market was helping steady sentiment, enabling the index to shrug off falls in New York and London. "In these uncertain times the money tends to be directed towards the more conservative area of the market," Spiteri said. "The banks seem to have a fairly solid undertone after experiencing reasonable falls in the first two to three months of the year, and Telstra is also attracting solid support." NAB jumped 50 cents to 32.45 dollars, the Commonwealth rose 28 cents to 26.33 dollars, Westpac closed up 44 cents at 15.52 dollars and ANZ gained 27 cents to close at 18.20 dollars. News Corp, which generates 75 percent of its earnings in the United States, closed down 14 cents at 10.63 and telecoms giant Telstra rose two cents to 4.09 dollars. In resources, Rio Tinto rose four cents to 31.07 dollars while BHP Billiton eased 21 cents to 9.07 dollars. ns/dv Stocks-Australia
