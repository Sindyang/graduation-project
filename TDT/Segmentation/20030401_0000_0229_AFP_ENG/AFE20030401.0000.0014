Livestock in southern China may be the source of the mysterious virus that has killed more than 60 people and caused a global health scare, sources close to the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Tuesday. "WHO is working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern China," a source from the Geneva-based body told AFP in Manila. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which erupted in southern China's Guangdong province has spread to Hong Kong and taken worldwide in an unprecedented fashion by airline passengers. "In some areas in Guangdong province in southern China, people just live neck to jaw with animals -- pigs, chickens, ducks are everywhere," the source said. Scientists have already ruled out a link between SARS and bird flu, also a viral disease highly contagious to chickens, ducks, turkeys and other birds but not dangerous to other animals and humans. Asked to confirm the links between SARS and farm animals in southern China, Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying this is the cause but is certainly something we are looking into in the general scheme of things." Cordingley said the WHO was still awaiting authorisation from the Chinese authorities to pay a visit to Guangdong province, where the SARS outbreak occurred way back in November. China has come under fire from various quarters for providing little information about the epidemic south of the world's most populous nation where 34 people have died so far, according to Chinese authorities. The mysterious illness has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62 people. pp/jvg/pch Health-pneumonia-Asia-virus
