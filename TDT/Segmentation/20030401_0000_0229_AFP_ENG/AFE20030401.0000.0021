His pull-up jumper touched nothing but net, and Allen Iverson froze, pointing a finger toward Monty Williams, who leapt off the bench as the Orlando Magic called a time-out. This was a slugfest, and late in the fight, Iverson delivered a potent blow that eventually won the game for the 76ers Monday. The final score: Sixers 118, Magic 113, appropriately enough in overtime. It was a tough, tight, fun and frenetic game from tip-off to final buzzer, a bruiser between two teams who, if the Magic hold up, will be playing when the postseason begins in a few weeks. For the Sixers, the win was as impressive as any they had during a wild month that ended where it started - on the road, in front of a hostile crowd. The Sixers ended March with their 11th win in 16 attempts, their ninth in 12 road games, and they officially own a playoff berth. "Good," Iverson said when told of his team's achievement. "It's just a good feeling we're in. The East's so crazy." So was this game. After a frenzied three quarters, the Sixers trailed Orlando, 107-97, with three minutes, 31 seconds to go. But suddenly, despite being unable to stop him all game, the Sixers quieted Tracy McGrady, who began missing shots and committing turnovers. With a 13-3 run, the Sixers pulled even with Orlando, 110-110, with 32.9 seconds remaining. That score stood at the buzzer, and the Sixers set the tone for overtime when Kenny Thomas dunked an Iverson miss on the first play. "It's a huge win for us," coach Larry Brown said. "It caps off an unbelievable month." All night, it was the Iverson-McGrady show, with each player trying to one-up the other. But when McGrady stared down the Sixers' bench after a fourth-quarter turnaround jumper, the heat was on. While the Magic managed only three points in overtime, the Sixers scored eight, and Iverson delivered four of them. In 50 minutes of action, he finished with a game-high 42 points, six assists and six rebounds. For the 13th consecutive game, McGrady scored at least 30 points. He missed 20 shots but fell one assist shy of a triple-double with 39 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists. "They're two of the best players I've ever seen play out there," Brown said. "Allen and Tracy, they ought to bottle those two." The Sixers could bottle whatever propelled them through March. The travel was brutal, the crowds hostile, and the time at home scarce. But they bonded on the road, and Thomas has emerged playing better than anyone except Iverson. Monday, he recorded his fifth double-double in the last six games. His statistics were so gaudy that Iverson was dismayed when, in the locker room, Eric Snow pointed them out. Thomas had 24 points and 20 rebounds, becoming the first Sixer since Dikembe Mutombo in January 2002 to grab 20 rebounds. "I've never been to the playoffs," said Thomas, who spent his first few seasons with the Houston Rockets. "So every chance I get to step on the floor, I'm going to help my team win." The Sixers won for just the sixth time in 28 games at the TD Waterhouse Center, and evened their four-game season series with the Magic. gph03 Basket-NBA-Iverson
