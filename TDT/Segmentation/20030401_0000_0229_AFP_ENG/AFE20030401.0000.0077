All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu is to take a four-week break from rugby after a flare-up of his chronic kidney problem, New Zealand Rugby Union deputy chief executive Steve Tew said Tuesday "Jonah's health is paramount and his doctors have recommended that he take a full break from rugby so that he can receive the appropriate medical treatment," Tew said. Lomu was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving regular treatment, including consultations with All Blacks doctor John Mayhew. "This is a chronic intermittent condition which has fluctuated over the last six or seven years," Mayhew said. "We are hopeful that the modifications in his treatment will enable him to return to rugby in the near future. We will re-evaluate the situation after four weeks." mjf/rcw RugbyU-NZL-Lomu
