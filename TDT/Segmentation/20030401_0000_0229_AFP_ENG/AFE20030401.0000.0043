A key suspect in the Bali bombings has been included in the Indonesian resort island's pantheon of Hindu demons, with his effigy due to be torched later Tuesday during a religious purification ceremony. A two-meter (6.6 foot) papier-mache likeness of Amrozi was to be carried around this tourist beach resort -- now largely empty of foreigners following the October 12 terror blasts, which killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists but also including 38 Indonesians. The effigy depicts Amrozi carrying two dynamite sticks with an evil deity known as Rangda clinging to his back, her matted white hair flowing in the wind. His trial is expected to start later this month and will be followed by those of 30 other suspects. Amrozi and three others could face the death penalty if convicted over the bombings. Amrozi's effigy will join about a dozen other Ogoh-Ogoh -- large papier-mache representations of evil spirits -- that will be noisily paraded around Sanur in a rite known as Ngerupuk to scare away demons and other spirits on the eve of the Nyepi festival. The Ogoh-Ogohs will end their short lives in flames at the beach Tuesday evening, with the remains cast into the sea. Similar parades will be held across the island. During Nyepi -- "Silent Day" -- on Wednesday, the island's international airport will close for 24 hours from 6:00 am, except for transit flights. Hindus should refrain from travelling outside their homes, lighting fires or using electrical power and making any noise. All shops, bars, restaurants and offices on the island are expected to shut. In past years everyone on the island -- including Indonesian Muslims and Christians and foreign tourists -- has been urged to stay home or in hotel rooms. An estimated 90 percent of Balinese follow the Hindu religion. Nyepi, which marks the start of the Hindu new year, is also a public holiday throughout mainly Muslim Indonesia. str/bs/sm/sdm/mfc Indonesia-attacks-festival
