Fear and confusion over a killer virus which has left more than 60 people dead and 1,700 infected worldwide are boosting sales of traditional medicine and vitamins in East Asia. Doctors and Chinese medicine practitioners warn that herbal remedies and Vitamin C will not provide a guarantee against catching Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), but the cash registers keep ringing. The virus causing SARS, a mystery respiratory illness which first erupted in southern China and has been transported to North America and Europe by travellers, has yet to be identified by scientists. In the meantime, Asians are fortifying themselves with self-prescribed remedies and wearing medical masks to avoid catching the virus. Freddie Lim of TCM Chinese Medicines in Singapore, which sells "strengthening teas" to worried families, said his concoction "will strengthen your immune system, but it won't cure SARS." Singapore is a predominantly ethnic Chinese city state where four people have died and 92 infected by SARS. Schools have been shut down in a bid to contain the spread of the disease. Chinese believe "body heat" can cause flu, so one must take "cooling" concoctions to expel this from the system. Chen Keng Leong, another traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Singapore, sells family packs as well as individual servings of herbal teas "but again we want people to know that there are no guarantees." "Traditional medicine encourages long-term health care solutions, and not short term quick-fixes," he said. In Taipei, Huang Yu-han, a doctor from the Chinese Medicine Department of Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, said he had advised his patients to boost their immune systems. "Chinese herbal medicines are not supposed to kill viruses but to help the patients diagnosed as showing the symptoms of 'hsu,' or physical weakness," he said. Li Ying-sang, chairman of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Merchants Association, said orders for herbal medicines have more than doubled in the past two weeks. Some consumers even come with their own prescriptions. "Chinese herbal medicine is widely believed to have preventive properties, and is mainly used to build up body resistance," he said. In the past week, leading Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong have published several prescriptions, while others offered recipes for medicinal soups to strengthen the lungs, such as chestnut brewed with lean pork along with dried tamarind skin and dried sweet plum. Others prescribed chrysanthemum and honey to expel body toxins and heat. In Beijing, residents are stocking up on Banlangen, a traditional Chinese medicine believed to be effective in preventing flu. Jiao Lifang, a Beijing-based staff member at Tongrentang, a chain store for traditional Chinese medicine, said daily sales of Banlangen have increased five to 10 times as a result of the health scare. Mainstream pharmacies and healthcare stores are also experiencing an increase in sales of Vitamin C, which has long been regarded as an immunity booster against colds and flu. Andrew Chng, a 31-year-old Singaporean engineer, bought some Vitamin C after being affected by all the news about SARS. "Me and my girlfiend decided to be safe than sorry," he said. A family doctor in Singapore said "my advice to patients is to eat properly, drink lots of water, take plenty of fruits, get enough sleep and avoid crowded places." "These are the normal sensible things to do to stay healthy," he said. "Not everybody who comes into contact with SARS becomes infected. If your immunity is stronger, then you're less likely to catch the infection, and even if you catch the infection, you are able to fight the infection." str/rc/bh/pch Asia-health-pneumonia-antidote
