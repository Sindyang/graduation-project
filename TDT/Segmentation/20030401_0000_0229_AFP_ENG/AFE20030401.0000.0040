Many analysts predict a protracted bloodbath when coalition forces finally take on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's most loyal fighters in the streets of Baghdad. But in the country's second city of Basra, British troops are slowly claiming success in their bid to root out Saddam's forces while sparing themselves and local civilians a savage street-fight. The battle for Basra, a port and vital gateway for humanitarian supplies, provides an insight into how the coalition may be planning to take Baghdad and bring about the "implosion" of Saddam's regime. Having secured their supply lines to Kuwait in the south and surrounded the city with troops from the 7th Armoured Brigade, in recent days the British have begun surgical ground and air strikes against key symbols of the Iraqi leader's power. "The targeting and eradication of the Baath party within Basra province is now our primary focus and military main effort," British spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon told reporters in Kuwait City on Saturday. In one attack, British tanks made an incursion to destroy a statue of Saddam and disable the local television station, which was being used by the ruling Baath party to spread propaganda. "We are conducting aggressive patrols specifically targeting Baath party personnel to drive a wedge between the regime and the people," said Marcus Deville, a civilian spokesman for the British forces. At the same time as they attack Saddam's power structures in the city, British troops have also been using humanitarian relief and radio broadcasts to try to win over the terrified population. In one example on Monday, the strategies intersected. A Baath party headquarters five kilometres (three miles) southeast of the city was captured and British soldiers said they allowed civilians to loot vast stocks of food. Meanwhile the British have began broadcasting propaganda of their own into the homes of Basra's 1.2 million people. Between Western pop hits and traditional Arab music, an announcer says the days of the regime are numbered. Coalition commanders initially hoped to ignite a popular rebellion in Basra. The city has a mainly Shiite population which has been brutally supressed by the largely Sunni Muslim regime in Baghdad. "The planning assumption had always been that the advancing coalition forces would simply sweep past Basra and it would implode by itself," said Brigadier Jim Dutton, commander of 3 Commando Brigade. But the rebellion has failed to materialise and the Iraqi troops are putting up a determined defence. Some residents say they dare not rise up against Saddam's Baath party fighters until they can be sure the foreign troops are serious about finishing the job. The US government urged Iraq's Shiites to rebel after the last Gulf War in 1991, but failed to back the uprising with military support. Thousands were murdered in the ensuing crackdown. Fleeing civilians have told reporters the Saddam loyalists are killing men who refuse to fight. Several have said they were leaving to make it easier for the British to take the city. On a larger scale, a similar modus operandi is unfolding as US troops close on Baghdad. Whether or not it succeeds remains to be seen, but the Americans insist that despite the tenacious resistance they have encountered in the south, the people of Iraq share their desire for regime change. "We remain convinced of what we're seeing across the country, as we're having more and more success, that the Iraqi people are welcoming the departure of the regime and its destruction," US General Vincent Brooks said at Central Command base Monday. The most spectacular attempt to kill those around Saddam was the March 20 bombing of a bunker where the CIA had located the Iraqi leader and his sons Qusay and Uday, a day before the military was to begin the bombing of Baghdad. On Monday alone, air strikes targeted a Baath party headquarters in the central town of Al Hillah, a military headquarters building in the west, an intelligence centre in Karbala, also in the centre, and Saddam's cherished Republican Palace in Baghdad. But Brooks stressed that air strikes were only the most visible part of the strategy. Also at work were squads of special forces agents, he said. "Coalition special operations forces continue their operations and actions throughout Iraq. They're facilitating attacks against regime targets and death squads within urban areas," he said. "These attacks are enabled by information provided by the local populations." smc/rm/tm Iraq-war-Basra-Baghdad
