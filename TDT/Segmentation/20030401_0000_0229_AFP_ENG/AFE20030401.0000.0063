BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - US-British forces bombarded the main presidential palace complex in the Iraqi capital on Tuesday morning for the second consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. A plume of smoke rose into the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the compound on the 13th day of the war around 9 am (0600 GMT). Baghdadis however continued to move around the city. The sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of President Saddam Hussein's grip on power, has been a frequent target of the bombardments and was struck twice on Monday. During the afternoon a warplane buzzed the compound, the largest of eight presidential palaces in the capital, and launched a missile which was followed by two more missile strikes in the evening. Around a dozen missiles had struck the Iraqi capital overnight. jch/bp/kir Iraq-war-Baghad-strike
