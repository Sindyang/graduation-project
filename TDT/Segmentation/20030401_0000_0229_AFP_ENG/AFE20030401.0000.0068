Beijing authorities have launched a crackdown on bogus health products and have targeted tonics boasting the ability to enhance sexual performance, official media reported Tuesday. Health officials making on-the-spot checks have so far found 125 kinds of health foods which were illegally advertised as being effective in treating sexual dysfunctions, the China Daily quoted Cai Changjing, an official with the Beijing Health Supervision Office as saying. Inspectors seized products from shelves and plan to fine the producers as well as distributors. The market is flooded with all varieties of medicine, food and health products making dubious claims. One type of capsule claimed to be effective in enhancing sexual ability, but its ingredients were made up of nothing but black sesame seed, Chinese yam, mulberry fruit and wild jujube, the Beijing Youth Daily said. Other products include pearl powder which some suppliers claim can treat high blood pressure, but has no such proven capabilities. Consumers have complained the products not only do not work but cause side effects including heart palpitations and nervousness. cs/rcw China-health-medicine
