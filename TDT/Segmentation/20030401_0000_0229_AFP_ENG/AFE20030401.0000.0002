Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile on Tuesday accused Japan and the European Union (EU) of jeopardising moves toward global free trade by making the World Trade Organization (WTO) miss a key deadline on agricultural reform. Vaile said foot dragging by anti-reformists among the 145-member WTO had led to the organisation missing its March 31 deadline for agreeing on the "modalities" -- or nuts and bolts details -- of freeing up farm trade. He warned the WTO's entire global trade liberalisation program could now become bogged down. "The responsibility for this failure sits squarely at the feet of those members, such as the EU and Japan, who are continuing to oppose efforts to bring about genuine trade reform of agricultural trade," he said. "It is time for some serious political leadership by the EU." Vaile said if no progress was made he would call a meeting in Geneva of the pro-reform Cairns Group, which has 18 members including Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Argentina. He is also likely to lobby developing nations in a bid to increase pressure for reform. "We will not sit idly by and watch the Europeans work up another no-reform proposal that will preserve agricultural protection for decades to come," Vaile said. The Cairns Group has proposed farm tariffs in developed countries be cut to a maximum of 25 percent but the EU and Japan advocate a slower approach, taking into account the role of farming in issues such as environmental protection and food security. Vaile has previously cited Japan's rice tariff of 778 percent and the EU sugar tariff of 228 percent as examples of unacceptable practices. Most recently, he condemned Japan's decision last week to hike tariffs on Australian beef imports from 38.5 percent to 50 percent from August. Agriculture has proved a crucial stumbling block in the implementation of the WTO's so-called Doha round of trade reform, which is due to be completed by the end of 2004. The Doha talks also cover other trade areas including services and industrial tariffs such as anti-dumping measures. Opposition trade spokesman Craig Emerson said the WTO strategy for global tariff reform was being undermined by a succession of bilateral free trade agreements, such as the one currently being negotiated between Australia and the United States. Emerson likened the WTO's problem to that faced by the United Nations over Iraq, where coalition partners acted against Iraq without waiting for approval from the UN. "The world is living dangerously, with multilateral institutions being undermined by bilateral and regional efforts," he said. ns/dv WTO-trade-agriculture-Australia
