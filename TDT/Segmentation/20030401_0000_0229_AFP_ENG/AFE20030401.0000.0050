Livestock in southern China may be the source of the mysterious virus that has killed more than 60 people and caused a global health scare, sources close to the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Tuesday. "WHO is working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern China," a source close to the Geneva-based body told AFP. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which erupted in southern China's Guangdong province has spread to Hong Kong and been taken worldwide in an unprecedented fashion by airline passengers. "In some areas in Guangdong province in southern China, people just live neck to jaw with animals -- pigs, chickens, ducks are everywhere," the source said. Scientists have already ruled out a link between SARS and bird flu, also a viral disease highly contagious to chickens, ducks, turkeys and other birds but not dangerous to other animals and humans. Asked to confirm the links between SARS and farm animals in southern China, Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying this is the cause but is certainly something we are looking into in the general scheme of things." Cordingley said the WHO was still awaiting authorisation from the Chinese authorities to pay a visit to Guangdong province, where the SARS outbreak occurred way back in November. Jean-Marc Olive, the WHO representative to the Philippines, said in a separate interview on government television that experts were still "laboratory researching" for leads that could lead to the discovery of the virus. "Now there is a possible lead that it is a virus infecting animals that jumped to various species as it has happened in the past and its another way to try to investigate these cases and discover the virus," Olive told NBN television. China has come under fire from various quarters for providing little information about the epidemic in the south of the world's most populous nation where 34 people have died so far, according to Chinese authorities. The mysterious illness has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62 people. Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based WHO expert on communicable disease, said viruses of many emerging diseases were known to have come from animals by "crossing species barriers." He cited as examples the deadly incurable haemorrhagic fever Ebola, whose virus is suspected to have come from monkeys and another killer virus, the Nipah virus, which may have originated from bats. The Nipah virus is named after the location where it was first detected in Malaysia in 1999, when pigs were reported to be the apparent source of infection among most human cases. The Nipah virus is a member of the virus family called paramyxoviridae. The family includes the paramyxovirus, which the WHO has not ruled out as a possible cause for SARS, perhaps working in conjunction with another virus family called coronavirus. The paramyxovirus causes common illnesses like mumps and measles while the coronavirus caused the common cold. Oshitani told AFP that the viruses linked to SARS are known to be different from those currently infecting humans. He said that some laboratories, including France's Pasteur Institute in Paris, found the coronavirius while others discovered the paramyxovirus in samples of SARS patients. "But we still don't know what is the relationship between the two viruses in terms of being the causative agent of SARS," he said. On Monday, Oshitani said scientists working in 11 laboratories around the world were just days away from identifying the virus that causes SARS. "We still need some more time to find what is the real cause of the SARS outbreak and how these two viruses evolve in the disease history." Oshitani said that SARS virus was more dangerous than the Ebola virus "in terms of infectivity but in terms of severity and case fatality rates, it is less dangerous." He said SARS was the "most significant outbreak of a disease through air travel in history" while the international collaboration to determine its cause is "the biggest for an emerging disease." pp/jvg/pch Health-pneumonia-Asia-virus
