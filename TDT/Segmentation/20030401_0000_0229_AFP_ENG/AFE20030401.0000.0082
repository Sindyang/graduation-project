West Indies have called on Brian Lara as skipper to help them deal with an expected assault by the world champion Australians. Left-hander Lara is back in charge more than three years after he relinquished the role. And the 33-year-old is confident his side can compete with the Australians, starting on 10 April with the first Test in Georgetown, Guyana. "I wouldn't take the job if I didn't think we could win the series," said Lara. "We've got a team that is full of a lot of potential. "We need to shape our characters against the best team in the world. There is no better opposition to do that against." Trinidad-born Lara, who holds the world record for the highest Test (375) and first-class score (501), has a Test average of 49.49 after 90 Tests. He replaces Carl Hooper for the four Tests and seven one-day internationals against the World Cup winners, who under Steve Waugh are aiming to return to the top of the ICC Test rankings. "I've had two years of introspection, two years of looking and seeing where I've gone wrong," Lara said. "It was a period of learning. A lot of things I had done two years ago, I don't think I'll be doing now. "Definitely it will be a different style. It will definitely be Brian Lara you're seeing out there." Lara said that other than Carl Hooper and Ridley Jacobs there was little experience in the side. "So I think it would be a dereliction of duty if I was presented the job and to turn it down. I see my responsibilities and I want to play a part." Australian Bennett King takes over as coach from Roger Harper, who did not re-apply for the job. King is currently in charge of the Australian Academy but is unavailable for Australia's visit and Sri Lanka's subsequent tour. His assistant, former Test wicketkeeper Gus Logie, will coach the team for those matches. Lara has already captained the side in 18 Tests, with a 6-10 win-loss record, while he also was in charge for 44 one-day internationals between March 1997 and January 2000. Lara has played in 90 Tests, scoring 7,572 runs - including 16 centuries - while he made a world record Test knock of 375 against England in Antigua in May 1994. In 1998, he was sacked as captain when a players' revolt over pay delayed the start of a tour of South Africa but was reinstated four days later to end the impasse. During Australia's 1999 tour to the Caribbean, Lara led by example, scoring a brilliant 213 in Kingston, which helped his side to share the series 2-2. But he gave up the captaincy in 2000 after West Indies suffered an embarrassing whitewash on a tour to New Zealand and replaced by Hooper. The West Indies Cricket Board named Ramnaresh Sarwan as vice-captain and added they were appointing Bennett King as new team coach subject to inking contractual negotiations. Former West Indies fast bowler Colin Croft told the BBC that the West Indies had little choice but to plump for Lara for the captaincy with few experienced alternatives available. "I think it will go down pretty well in the Caribbean. I think he was given the captaincy too early the first time. He's better equipped to deal with it now," Croft said. The West Indies, World Cup winners in 1975 and 1979, endured a poor competition in this year's event. They finished fourth in Pool B in South Africa with three wins, two defeats and a rain-ruined no-result against Bangladesh which knocked them out of the tournament at the first round stage. Australian Test captain Steve Waugh said before leaving Sydney he believed the West Indies, led by Lara, were on the way to becoming a force again in world cricket. "They went through a tough phase for a few years. They've rebounded fairly well and they seem to be more together," said Waugh, who has played a world record 156 Test matches. Australia are fresh from a 4-1 Ashes series victory over England and a successful World Cup title defence and are keen to reclaim their ranking as the top Test side from South Africa. Australia last toured the Caribbean four years ago, Waugh leading the visitors to a 2-2 draw in his first series as captain following the retirement of Mark Taylor. Lara blasted 546 runs at an average of 91 including a highest score of 213 among his three centuries in the series. "He was phenomenal last time we were there and, knowing him, he will want to play well against the best side in the world, so he'll definitely fire up," Waugh said. "They're going to be a lot tougher than people give them credit for and we certainly won't be underestimating them." str/rw03 Cricket-WIS-AUS-Lara
