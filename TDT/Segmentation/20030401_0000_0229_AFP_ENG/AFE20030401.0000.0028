AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US marines have seized a huge Iraqi ammunition supply depot in south-central Iraq, an officer said in a statement released here Tuesday at the US military's forward command center. "We continue to press the attack against the enemy, conducting spoiling raids while eliminating Saddam's ability to support his death squads and their mistreatment of the Iraqi people," said Colonel Bennett W. Saylor, 1st Marine Division chief of staff. The raid was carried out Sunday on the 11th day of a US-led invasion aimed at toppling President Saddam Hussein. The marines found large stocks of ammunition, rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and other weapons, the statement said. Marine Corps demolitions and ordnance experts were called to the scene, the precise location of which was not disclosed, to evaluate means to dispose of the weapons and ammunition. No marines or civilians were reported injured during the seizure of the depot, according to the US military. nh/kir Iraq-war-US-marines-depot
