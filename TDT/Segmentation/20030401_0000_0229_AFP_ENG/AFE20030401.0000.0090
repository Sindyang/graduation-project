Australia reported its first suspected case of a deadly respiratory virus on Tuesday and Hong Kong considered setting up camps to quarantine victims of the disease which has sparked a global health crisis. France joined the list of countries advising against travel to Asian nations affected by the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and screening travellers. Livestock in southern China were cited on Tuesday as a possible cause of the virus that has killed 62 people so far -- 34 in China, 15 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. Frustration was growing meanwhile with China for its handling of the SARS outbreak, which began in southern China in November, spread to Hong Kong in February and from there to three continents through airline passengers. In Australia, health officials said a man recently returned from Singapore had become the country's first likely SARS case but had made a full recovery after being admitted to a Sydney hospital. "We still cannot be sure this person had SARS but in the absence of other diagnosis, we thought it would be prudent to alert the WHO (World Health Organisation) to this unusual case," said chief medical officer Richard Smallwood. "That one case is all we've seen but it hasn't spread in Australia," he stressed. France, where four SARS cases have been reported, became the latest country to advise against travel to Hong Kong and regions of China and announced it would begin screening travellers from SARS-affected countries. In Hong Kong, where 15 people have died of SARS and more than 600 have been infected, the authorities said they were looking into the possibility of using government holiday camps as quarantine centres. The Hong Kong authorities have already taken the extraordinary step of isolating an entire housing block for 10 days in an attempt to control the epidemic around 200 residents were found to be infected. Hong Kong and Singapore have also closed all primary and secondary schools in a bid to stem the outbreak. Singapore has put more than 800 households under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days and put 600,000 school children on holiday until April 6. The Wall Street Journal urged the world to sever all travel links to China for the "grossly negligent" way it has handled the outbreak. "Given Beijing's refusal to take even elementary public health measures, some hard choices are called for," the US newspaper said. "The most effective way to halt the spread of the disease would be for other countries to suspend all travel links with China until it has implemented a transparent public health campaign." The WHO has been more restrained with the Chinese authorities but a WHO expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission to travel to Guangdong province, the epicentre of the outbreak, betrayed some annoyance on Tuesday. "China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire. "During a global epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. A source close to the WHO said on Tuesday that the Geneva-based health body was "working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern China". Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying this is the cause but it is certainly something we are looking into in the general scheme of things." Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based WHO expert on communicable diseases, said viruses of many emerging diseases were known to have come from animals by "crossing species barriers". Oshitani said SARS was the "most significant outbreak of a disease through air travel in history". bur/cl/pch Health-pneumonia
