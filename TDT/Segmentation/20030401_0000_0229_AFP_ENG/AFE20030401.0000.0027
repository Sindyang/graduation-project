North Korea on Tuesday accused the United States of abusing the religious and human rights of Islamic nations by waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan after Washington branded the Stalinist state a serial human rights abuser. Washington's human rights abuse charges were "fictions" brought as pretexts by the United States in its goal of launching military action against North Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. "Such crafty trick can never be tolerated," the agency said. "The people of the DPRK (North Korea) are single-heartedly united as a big harmonious family because religious freedom and human rights are fully guaranteed by law." KCNA said the United States was in no position to criticize other nations on human rights. "The US human rights abuses are clearly evidenced by its war moves for carrying out its strategy to dominate the world. Its wars against Islamic Afghanistan and Iraq are a clear proof of its typical religious and human rights abuses," KCNA said. "The US, which is killing innocent people after violating the sovereignty of Iraq, is faulting other countries, behaving as if it were a human rights judge. How brazen-faced and ridiculous it is." KCNA said a resolution passed in the US Congress that "groundlessly" denounced suppression of religious freedom and other human rights abuses in North Korea was referred to the UN Commission on Human Rights now sitting in Geneva. "The DPRK strongly protests against these actions," KCNA said. The protest came a day after the US State Department criticised North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il's regime for using torture, forced abortion and capital punishment as instruments of state power. In its annual human rights report, the State Department painted an appalling picture of life in North Korea. The report came as the United States is locked in a showdown with North Korea over the isolated country's plans to develop nuclear weapons. "The government's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," the State Department report said. "Citizens did not have the right peacefully to change their government, and the leadership viewed most international human rights norms, particularly individual rights, as illegitimate, alien, and subversive to the goals of the state and party," it added. cw/jkw/sdm/mfc NKorea-rights-US
