Japan Post kicked off its first day as a corporation Tuesday to fanfare and anxiety as it took over the nation's postal services and some 359 trillion yen (3.0 trillion dollars) in savings and insurance funds. President Masaharu Ikuta, in noting the biggest change in the postal services' 132-year history, promised to improve services and vowed the firm would accumulate net profit of 4.0 trillion yen in the four years to March 2007. "We promise to work together so that people will say that postal services have improved since the launch of Japan Post," Ikuta said at a banner-unveiling ceremony at the headquarters in Tokyo. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said it was a "first step" in realising one of his long-held pet reform projects, hatched even before becoming president of the Liberal Democratic Party when he served as minister of post and telecommunications in the mid-1990s. "This is effectively the first step toward privatisation," he said. "I want them to improve management and privatise this business smoothly so the government can sell their shares in it at high prices." Ikuta has been lauded as a champion of reform for helping resuscitate Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Japan's second largest shipping company. But critics wondered whether he could steer the massive postal system, with 280,000 employees and 24,700 post offices nationwide, toward privatisation. "The original idea of the reform was to break the monopoly on postal services and reform the postal savings and insurance systems, whic can cause chaos in the financial markets," the Mainichi newspaper wrote in an editorial Tuesday. "The route from public corporation to privatisation must be made clear, but so far, we have seen no signposts," it said. There are high hurdles to enter nationwide mail delivery services. Among other conditions, the Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications require newcomers to ordinary mail services to install at least 99,000 postboxes nationwide. The number is equivalent to about 60 percent of the postboxes currently installed. As of Tuesday, only five parcel delivery firms using motorcycles had applied to operate mail delivery services in limited regions, which do not require the establishment of postboxes. mis-rn/ja/dv Japan-post-privatisation-company-economy
