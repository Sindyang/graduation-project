Crack US troops unnerved by Iraqis firing from ambulance, garbage truck by Tim Sloan = (PICTURE) = SOUTHERN IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - Paratrooper Zach Talraas nursed his wounds on a hospital bed and shook his head at how Iraqi troops firing from a garbage truck and an ambulance could face down the the US army's elite 82nd Airborne Division. "It makes the job a lot tougher. You have to take a second or half a second before you can start firing in reference to determining if a target is hostile or friendly like the ambulance," the private from Delta 325 Company said. The 82nd Airborne is one of the United States' most celebrated and battle-tested units but it was clearly caught off guard by the unconventional Iraqi tactics. The firefight left several wounded, at least two seriously, and men like Talraas unnerved. "Saddam's whole thing is to make us look like the bad guys in reference to having to fight against guerilla tactics and people using ambulances as cover," he said. The platoon had been tasked with securing two bridges in the city. Taking the first bridge "was almost too easy", said Talraas, but the next part of the mission was anything but. US troops driving in humvees first came under fire from civilian vehicles, hitting back with 50 caliber rounds and Mark 19 grenade launchers. They were again taken by surprise when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) was fired at them from a garbage truck, said Talraas. "A man hiding in a dumpster fired an RPG at one of the humvees. Several soldiers received small shrapnel wounds but were able to continue fighting. The dumpster was destroyed with return fire," he said. The respite was brief however as a white ambulance with red flashing lights crossed the bridge and headed straight for the US troops before its occupants also opened fire. US troops returned fire and the ambulance retreated but they were then were pinned down by sniper fire for the better part of an hour before a decision was made to break contact, pull back and regroup. Talraas tried to take cover behind his gun turret on the humvee but was injured in the shooting. His driver was shot in the hand. "My driver screamed and then I felt myself get shot," said Talraas. "It was pretty scary. It reminded me of a scene from (the Vietnam war movie) Full Metal Jacket." Talraas stayed in his gun turret "to lay down suppressive fire as we had another platoon on foot next to the humvee and couldn't just leave them". The shooting eventually died down and the soldiers were able to retreat. But Talraas said the incident had highlighted that the rules of combat in Iraq are anything but black and white. "All the combatants were in civilian clothing and not using any military vehicles," he said. Talraas was being treated at an Iraqi air base captured by coalition forces. One of the casualties has been flown out of Iraq. ts-co/pm/dab Iraq-war-ambulance
