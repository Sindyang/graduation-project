Asian sharemarkets and the dollar paused to catch their breath on Tuesday following their latest slump but oil prices edged higher as worries over the impact of the US-led war in Iraq continued to shake confidence. Global share markets and the dollar slumped on Monday but regained some balance in Asian trading on Tuesday. However, there was nothing to suggest any turnaround in confidence. The US and British onslaught on Baghdad continued on Tuesday with a dozen US cruise missiles bombarding the Iraqi capital. Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard faced their first significant battle with coalition forces on the ground. US forces also shot dead seven women and children after the civilian vehicle in which they were traveling failed to stop at a military checkpoint in central Iraq. Japanese shares ended the day slightly higher after some buying linked to the start of the new Japanese financial year. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 closed up 14.01 points or 0.18 percent at 7,986.72. Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Hinode Securities, said fears the US-led war in Iraq would be prolonged were still overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets continue to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," he said. Many sharemarkets in Asia continued to be rattled by the spread of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The flu-like virus has now infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62 people worldwide. In Hong Kong, where 15 people have died, authorities are isolating an entire housing block for 10 days in an attempt to control the epidemic after about 200 residents were found to be infected. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.03 percent to close the morning at 8,545.21. "Selling pressure continued in the morning amid concerns over the spread of SARS in Hong Kong and the prospects of a prolonged war in Iraq," Kim Eng Securities senior sales manager Simon Tam said. But Singapore's Straits Times index closed the early session up 0.77 percent at 1,277.39 after falling 3.84 percent a day earlier. "I think the losses yesterday were a bit overdone and the market is now adjusting," DBS Vickers Securities strategist Eddie Lee said. Taiwan's weighted index closed up 0.38 percent at 4,337.61 due to mild bargain hunting after falling 3.48 percent on Monday. South Korea's composite index closed up 0.53 percent at 538.56. Wall Street's Dow Jones industrials average dropped 153.64 points or 1.89 percent to 7,992.13 on Monday and the technology-laden Nasdaq index declined 28.43 points or 2.08 percent to 1,341.17. "The picture overall remains bleak," said Prudential Securities analyst Bryan Piskorowski. "Investors struggle with the ongoing travails of war, soft economic data and the advent of earnings preannouncement season." A Chicago Purchasing Management Association survey showed industrial activity in the US Midwest region slumped in March as production took the biggest dive in 23 years. The dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday as investors all but ignored worsening Japanese business confidence shown in the latest Bank of Japan's Tankan survey. The greenback was quoted at 118.24 yen mid-afternoon, up from 118.15 yen in New York late on Monday. The euro was buying 1.0910 dollars, against 1.0902 dollars in New York. "Investors ... were more concerned about the possibility of a long war in Iraq and its impact on the US economy," said Masato Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings. Oil prices were higher in Asian trading amid mounting concerns the ongoing US-led war against Iraq will be prolonged, dealers said. The benchmark New York light sweet crude contract for May delivery traded at 31.11 dollars a barrel, up seven cents from its close of 31.04 in New York on Monday. burs/bro/dv Markets-world
