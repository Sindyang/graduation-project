Red tape, face-saving measures and institutional incompetence are most likely behind China's refusal to face up to the outbreak of a deadly respiratory disease, experts said Tuesday. Under international criticism, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) issued its first bulletin on atypcial pneumonia since March 26 urging all health departments to take effective measures to control the disease that has killed at least 62 people worldwide. Doctors were also urged to report to their provincial disease control centers any patients showing symptoms of atypical pneumonia, guidelines on the CDCP's website said. A team of World Health Organization experts was Tuesday also awaiting Beijing's permission to travel to southern Guangdong province where they believe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) first broke out last November. China has been the country worst hit by the mysterious virus, which has left 34 dead and more than 800 infected. Most SARS figures came from a report by Guangdong province that only went up to March 1. Fifteen people have died and more than 600 have been infected in neighboring Hong Kong after a doctor from Guangdong brought the illness into the territory. The WHO experts were reportedly seeking to investigate whether or not farm animals in southern China were the source of the virus. "China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire, a WHO expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission to go to Guangdong. "During a global epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. The team of five WHO experts was also waiting for China to fulfill its promise of providing daily provincial reports updating the progress of the disease nationwide, but so far such reports have not been forthcoming. "We are hoping to get updated information, but China has a system that is not exactly set up for this type of thing, so changes to the system is what is needed, as soon as possible." Political considerations and "red tape" were also slowing down China's responsiveness, he said. "This is an institutionalized problem, health officials are just not used to reporting because the spread of disease in China has always been secretive," said Hu Jia, director of the Beijing-based Aizhi Institute, a non-governmental AIDS awareness group. "I think it is pretty clear, the government does not want to see China as the center of transmission of atypical pneumonia," Hu told AFP. Other considerations were obviously involved, Hu said, like China's foreign trade, dependence on foreign investment and a booming tourist industry. "If they want to maintain foreign trade, continue to attract foreign investment and put on an Olympic Games, then China needs to have a world class public health system," an international health worker in Beijing said. "I think they recognize this, but in China change has never come easily," he said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, the state-run press failed to carry any new updates on the spread of the disease in the country on Tuesday, as more international events scheduled to be held in China were cancelled. Following the cancelation of two Rolling Stones concerts in Shanghai and Beijing on Saturday and several sporting events last week, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced Tuesday it would postpone its annual China Business Summit due to the epidemic. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal blasted China's silence as a "cover-up," and urged the world to cut all travel links to China for the "grossly negligent" way it has handled the epidemic. "The most effective way to halt the spread of the disease would be for other countries to suspend all travel links with China until it has implemented a transparent public health campaign," the paper said. sai/ph/sdm/pch Health-pneumonia-China
