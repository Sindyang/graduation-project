Virgin Blue refused to confirm previously flagged plans for a mid-year partial float Tuesday, amid reports the airline's co-owners Virgin Group and Patrick Corp. were at loggerheads over the issue. Richard Branson's Virgin Group wants to stick to the original timetable but Corrigan's Patrick Corp. is unwilling to reduce its 50 percent stake below 45 percent, according to a report in the Financial Review. Analysts said Corrigan's position made sense because a long-running slump in the global airline industry had been exacerbated by the war in Iraq and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis. "Branson is keen to get the money for other areas of Virgin Group but it's hard to argue with Patrick's position that the timing is wrong," said one Sydney-based analyst, who did not want to be named. "Virgin Blue generates a lot of cash, it doesn't need to list on the stock exchange and get a balance sheet, it an afford all of its capex (capital expenditure) needs." He said Patrick also had more selfish reasons for delaying the float as long as possible. When Patrick bought half of Virgin Blue for 260 million dollars (156 million US) in March last year, it also agreed on deferred payments of 30 million dollars for every 100 million dollars the airline's market capitalisation rose above 600 million dollars. With the market expected to value Virgin Blue at 1.0 to 1.5 billion dollars in the event of a partial float, Patrick could be forced to write a cheque for up to 270 million dollars. "If it avoids having Virgin Blue's market cap crystallised by a float then Patrick can continue to defer this payment or avoid it altogether," the analyst said. The reported spat is the first sign of tensions within Virgin Blue, which has taken more than 20 percent of the Australian domestic market since it began in 2000. In response to the reports, Virgin Blue said no timeline had been finalised for the float plans and Patrick refused to comment. Branson said last November that he expected Virgin Blue's net profit to exceed 100 million dollars this financial year. ns/dv Australia-air-Virgin-IPO-stocks-company
