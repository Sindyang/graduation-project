The United States praised Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday and castigated her bitter enemies in the country's junta, in a withering analysis of the country's human rights situation. "Even after years of on-and-off political arrest, harassment and constant surveillance, Aung San Suu Kyi is still wholly committed to bringing democracy and a humane rule of law to the Burmese people," the State Department said in its annual human rights report. "Her tremendous strength of character stands boldly in the face of the military regime's disregard for human rights and democracy, a disregard that extends to abuses such as extrajudicial killings, rapes, disappearances, forced labor and forced relocations." The United States engages in frequent rhetorical battles with the junta, and is a strong supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, maintaining an array of investment strategies to protest her exclusion from politics. It said that 1,300 political prisoners remained behind bars, in conditions which were often harsh and life-threatening. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, was released from house arrest in May 2002 and has been engaged in UN-brokered talks with the junta since October 2000, but they are yet to progress beyond a confidence-building stage. US officials have made no secret at their disappointment that the consultations have made little progress so far. The report, part of the broader Country Reports on Human Rights Practices covering 196 nations, slammed the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) for its "extremely poor" rights peformance in 2002. "The regime's human rights record remained extremely poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," the report said. It resuscitated allegations that Myanmar troops had raped women from ethnic minorities, especially in Shan, Karenni and Karen states, which drew international condemnation and fierce denials from the junta last year. The ruling junta's security forces, it said, "continued to commit extrajudicial killings and rape, forcibly relocated persons, used forced labor, and conscripted child soldiers." "Disappearances continued, and members of the security forces tortured, beat and otherwise abused prisoners and detainees." It also said the SPDC continued to restrict freedom of speech, press, assembly, association and religion, and that people suspected of pro-democratic activity were subjected to surveillance and harassment. It noted how Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was allowed to open 90 of some 300 offices nationwide last year, but said the SPDC did not allow domestic human rights organizations to function independently and remained hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. Myanmar, the former Burma, has been ruled by authoritarian military regimes since 1962. col/mlm/sdm/mfc US-rights-Myanmar
