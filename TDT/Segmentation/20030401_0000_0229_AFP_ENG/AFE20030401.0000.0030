Myanmar's health ministry said Tuesday it was conducting increased passenger screenings and other monitoring in efforts to combat the threat of a mysterious atypical pneumonia circling the globe. "We have been carefully monitoring passengers coming in at the airports with medical teams headed by specialists of infectious diseases," a senior health ministry official told AFP. The teams have been deployed at Yangon's international airport as well as at other airports, sea ports and checkpoints particularly along the Chinese and Thai borders, the official said. "We have taken all necessary measures to monitor the disease, and so far we have not found any suspected cases" of the disease labelled as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The deaths of at least 62 people have been attributed to the malady, which has sown worldwide fear with more than 1,700 people diagnosed with SARS in 15 countries around the globe. Myanmar has issued several public alerts about the respiratory illness over the past few weeks in its tightly controlled media, and advised anyone exhibiting symptoms such as fever, muscular aches, headache and a sore throat to report to hospital immediately. Tour companies have reported a decrease in business in the past month -- some saying it has dropped off by as much as 10 percent -- but have attributed the decline to concerns over war in Iraq rather than SARS. Air China officials in Yangon said the airline's two flights per week from the Myanmar capital to Beijing via the southern China city of Kunming were operating on schedule. Myanmar Airways International said its three weekly flights to Singapore were also unchanged. mlm/sb/mfc Health-pneumonia-Myanmar
