CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US marines deployed around the south-central Iraqi town of Shatra said Tuesday their relations with local civilians had sharpy improved as security returned following fierce fighting in the past week. About 1,000 marines were still seeking out and engaging remnants of Iraqi forces in the region but were encountering little significant Iraqi opposition, correspondents on the scene said. "We met only light resistance but we still need to provide security," said Lieutenant Colonel Peter Owen of the First Regimental Combat Team. "It's a lot better than what it was when we first came through there," he said, noting that contacts with the local population were getting markedly better. "We're seeing that the general consensus is that we are 12 years too late and there is a little bit of resentment, which is why we haven't seen a popular uprising because last time they didn't get support." Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq mounted a rebellion against President Saddam Hussein following the 1991 Gulf war but failed to get Western, and in particular US, backing. "They want to be absolutely sure we are prepared to get rid of the (ruling) Baath party before they commit." Owen said marines were also out to retrieve the body of one of their own killed in action last week, having received a report the body had been buried by a local villager. An officer who declined to be identified said: "Iraqi forces are learning they can't match us in firepower and they are pulling back and will probably attack softer targets." He too reported an improvement in ties with local people, recalling that one village elder rode an amphibious assault vehicle during a marine charge on the local Baath party headquarters. Party members fled and were later killed, prompting waves and cheers from the locals, he said. lh/nh/kir Iraq-war-US-Shatra
