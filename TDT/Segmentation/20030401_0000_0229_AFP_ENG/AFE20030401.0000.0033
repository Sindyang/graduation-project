A man with two hand grenades is holding an airliner with 46 passengers hostage at Havana's international airport, demanding that he be flown to Miami, officials said. The Soviet-made AN-24 airliner was en route from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker ordered the crew to head for Miami but had to land at Jose Marti International Airport because it had insufficient fuel, officials said in a statement. The airliner is currently parked on the tarmac as authorities "do their utmost to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives of the passengers," the statement added. The plane was hijacked at around 9:30 pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking off from Nueva Gerona, on the Island of Youth some 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of the capital, the statement said. It was the second hijacking in Cuba in less than a month. On March 9 another Cuban airliner also flying out of the Island of Youth was hijacked by six men with knives and told to fly to Florida. The plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, one of Florida's southernmost island. fgf/jlp Cuba-plane
