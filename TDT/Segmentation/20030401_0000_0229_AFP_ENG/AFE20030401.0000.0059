The acting president of Nauru had suffered a heart attack, less than a month after his predecessor died in a US hospital, Australian foreign ministry officials said Tuesday. A foreign affairs spokeswoman said acting president Derog Gioura was undergoing treatment at an unnamed Australian hospital and was expected to survive. Gioura, 71, was named acting president of the tiny Pacific nation in March after his predecessor Bernard Dowiyogo -- a diabetic for 30 years -- died following a marathon 11-hour heart operation in Washington. The Australian official said Gioura would remain head of a caretaker administration until elections scheduled for May. "He is still acting president," she said. "The parliament has been dissolved and elections aren't until May, so it doesn't change anything. "He's undergoing treatment." Nauru is home to 12,000 Micronesian people living on a single 21 square kilometre (eight square mile) island that has been scarred by a century of phosphate strip-mining. Once among the world's richest people thanks to phosphate royalties, the country is now effectively bankrupt. ns/rcw Nauru-president
