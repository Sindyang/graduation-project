Xinhua  News  Agency,  London,  March  31  (Bale-fire  line  with cotton  wadding  fly)  Yellow  Ribbon  transmitting  the  voice  of Xinhua  news  agency  reporter  Xu  Jianmei  Iraq  war  of  the  12th day,  31  March,  three  British  soldiers  who  refuse  to  be  known as  "innocent  civilians  resulting  in  death"  of  war  had  been repatriated.  The  British  Royal  United  Service  Institute,  the defense  experts  Michael  comments  road  Mai  Jindi:  they  "are in  fact  said:"  I  am  willing  to  sacrifice  for  the  country, willing  to  risk  their  lives  for  the  country;  but  in  return, I  expect  my  country  is  directed  me  to  do  the  right  thing. "  On  the  findings  of  an  opinion  poll:  Most  of  the  British government  does  not  expect  Iraq  to  the  United  States  and British  forces  as  "liberators"  (76  %),  the  Iraqi  people  will no  longer  expect  rallied  against  the  government  (86  %),  no longer  believe  majority  of  the  Iraqi  army  will  voluntarily surrender  (74  %)  and  no  longer  believed  that  the  United States  and  Britain  will  destroy  Iraq's  Resistance  Army  (89 %).  The  day  before,  the  British  government  and  military  support, right-wing  tabloid  "News  of  the  world"  issue  "for  our  heroes, on  a  Yellow  Ribbon  ".  On  the  following  day,  "the  Times" raised  acute  questions:  yellow  ribbon  of  the  British  hearts ?  What  meaning  can  look  at  how  the  British  forces  in  Iraq ?  4  presence  in  Gulf  British  their  name,  whether  "we  need the  support  of  the  war  hero  deserves  our  sympathy  ?  or misfortune  The  victims  ?  "  "The  times"  since  there  is  a challenge.  First,  according  to  historical  tradition,  the  British people  have  always  been  flag  rather  than  wearing  yellow  silk have  expressed  support  to  front-line  troops.  Iraq  since  the outbreak  of  war,  but  now  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  broken iron  shoes  flag  families.  Secondly,  the  United  Kingdom  and the  Western  world  practices,  yellow  ribbon  and  also  has  never had  any  involvement  in  war  or  heroism.  The  hostages  were abducted  for  safe  return,  it  would  be  on  a  Yellow  Ribbon; to  the  rehabilitation  of  children  suffering  from  leukaemia, relatives  and  friends  and  neighbours  will  be  on  a  yellow ribbon,  condolences  for  "9.11"  those  who  perished  in  the incident,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  have  been  on  a yellow  ribbon.  It  is  evident  that  yellow  ribbon  symbolizes the  suffering  of  innocent  people  in  western  compatriots  placed sincere  sympathy.  "News  of  the  world"  does  not  call  flag, but  called  on  a  yellow  ribbon,  inadvertently  revealed  the subconsciousness  contradictions  and  loss.  Every  British  Mothers' Day  is  March  30.  The  newspaper  under  the  title  is  finishing the  first  article:  "Mother's  Day  in  the  day,  we  pray  that our  safe  return  of  the  fighters  ",  which  is  the  real  message yellow  ribbon.  "The  Times"  said:  "Many  (British)  really  want to  say:  '  We  support  the  army,  but  we  do  not  need  to support  them  to  be  fighting  for  '  political  objectives  ". The  British  people  "the  strongest  wish  is  that  the  army to  return  home  safely  ".
