China's  "People's  Daily"  first  published  an  article  entitled "by"  democracy  "to  PA  Human  rights  "of  the  article,  which is  transmitted  as  follows  :  The  Pentagon  began  to  attack on  Iraq  since  last  year,  the  United  States  on  Iraq  launched a  massive  campaign  of  psychological  warfare.  It  is  learnt that  the  United  States  allocated  special  funds  for  the  establishment of  the  six  radio  stations,  and  the  round-the-clock  bombing Iraqi  military  and  the  public  opinion  in  fighting  around the  country  to  the  United  States  had  dropped  nearly  30  million leaflets.  The  content  of  their  very  much  the  same  message: the  United  States  not  to  attack  Iraq  oil,  but  Saddam  from the  Iraqi  people  under  the  rule  of  evil  "liberation"  come out  and  give  them  a  free  and  democratic  system.  However, such  as  ice  has  forcefully  publicity  Lok  river,  have  not produced  desired  results,  Iraq  has  so  far  there  has  been welcomed  the  US  people  together  "democratic"  military  scene. This  is  probably  because  the  Beautiful  "democratic"  cover finally  live  US  attempts  to  conceal  the  true  intention  hegemony. In  the  foreign  policy  since  World  War  II,  the  US  government enemy  distinguishing  between  friends,  it  is  to  take  "anti-communist and  pro-US  ",  and  is  no  way  constituted  a"  democracy  "to measure.  It  is  a  well-known  fact  that  in  Latin  America, the  United  States  has  military  support  to  battle  the  fire practice  subversive  Allende  democratically  elected  government and  long-term  support  notorious  Somoza  dictatorship  in  Asia, the  United  States  was  backing  some  dictatorial  regime.  Looking back  at  the  sites  Iraq  war,  the  United  States  of  hypocrisy and  democracy  are  two  faces  exposed.  The  United  States  for self-styled  "world's  most  democratic  country  ",  separation of  powers  in  the  country,  focusing  on  rule  of  law.  To  be in  sharp  contrast,  the  United  States  in  the  international arena,  but  it  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  hegemonic  faces: As  a  founding  member  of  the  United  Nations,  it  will  be their  rising  above  the  U.N.  ignored  the  UN  Charter  should not  interfere  in  internal  affairs  of  member  states,  and  asked the  Council  for  the  replacement  force  other  countries  open green  power.  The  two  bodies  at  a  time  when  the  United  Nations Security  Council  Resolution  1441,  the  inspection  of  Iraqi weapons  making  progress,  it  can  unilaterally  suspended  arrogant. The  vast  majority  of  countries  to  persuade  the  council  and opposed  to  the  peoples  of  the  world  that  the  surge  of  anti-war voice,  the  United  States  is  totally  blind,  turning  a  deaf ear,  and  insists  on  use  of  force.  Against  the  people  throughout the  world  public  opinion,  disrespect  for  the  United  Nations authority  and  violated  international  law  is  consistent  with the  spirit  of  democracy  ?  One  Western  scholars  recently  wrote an  article.  use  of  force  against  Iraq  on  the  United  States made  an  image  of  the  analogy.  He  said:  The  United  States just  like  the  plaintiff,  just  like  Iraq  suspects,  the  United Nations  as  the  judge  or  jury.  However,  the  United  States have  failed  to  produce  conclusive  evidence,  and  completion of  the  criminal  investigations  against  the  judge  and  jury refused  to  hear  the  views  of  Iraq's  death  sentence  and  unilateral and  arbitrary  law  enforcement.  This  is  not  only  against  principles of  democracy  itself  is  a  violation.  The  United  States  with its  own  words  and  deeds  to  let  people  see  the  fact  that the  United  States  attack  on  Iraq's  ultimate  aim  is  to  remove an  anti-American  regime,  established  in  the  Middle  East  a undisputed  status,  opening  the  way  for  the  establishment  of a  global  hegemony.  So-called  "anti-terrorism"  and  a  "democratic" and  so  on,  but  the  United  States  to  seek  hegemonism  means only.
