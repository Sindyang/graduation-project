Japanese  researchers  recently  developed  a  new  testing  technology, by  measuring  a  protein  in  the  concentration  of  blood  could be  judged  by  the  number  of  HIV  to  determine  the  extent of  his  condition  deteriorated,  precision  is  1,000  times  the current  testing  technology.  According  to  "Japan's  economic information"  on  the  31st,  if  people  became  infected  with the  AIDS  virus,  a  body  known  as  "SDF-1"  of  the  protein, several  times  to  dozens  of  times  more  increase  in  number more  virus,  which  is  more  protein,  and  "SDF-1"  in  the  concentration of  blood  to  the  AIDS  virus  barometer  of  the  change  in  volume. Early  rice  Matsumoto  and  his  son,  Professor  Tian  Daxue  and Kyoto  University  professor  Tian  Kai  on  behalf  of  the  development of  a  new  testing  methods  such  as  the  europium  rare-earth element.  Europium  luminous  character  is  that  it  can  identify with  "SDF-1"  in  conjunction  with  the  material  can  be  judged by  the  luminous  brightness  "SDF-1"  in  the  concentration  of blood.  Researchers  in  the  future  direction  of  the  AIDS  patients with  symptoms  of  "SDF-1"  The  concentration  of  blood  in  combined research.
