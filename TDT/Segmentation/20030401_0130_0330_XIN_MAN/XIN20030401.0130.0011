recently  convened  here  the  Zhejiang  Provincial  Tourism  Planning at  the  forum,  Zhejiang  University  historical  geography  expert Chen  Qiao  Yok  professor  raised  "grand  canal  began  in  Beijing and  eventually  Ningbo"  new  ideas  and  aroused  the  concern. The  Yok  said  Mr.  Chen  Qiao,  the  textbooks  written  more  than a:  Grand  Canal  began  in  Beijing,  Hangzhou  finally,  it  is customary  called  canal  Beijing-Hangzhou  University.  Chen,  in fact,  "Beijing-Hangzhou  Canal"  is  an  integral  part  of  the Grand  Canal,  should  be  started  in  Beijing  Grand  Canal,  and finally  Ningbo.  Yok  Chen  Qiao,  China's  Canal  hole  study  history and  modern  formerly  Qin,  scattered  throughout  the  country. The  Grand  Canal  paragraphs  are  all  have  their  own  names, such  as  Beijing  and  Hebei  Province  is  known  as  North  Canal, the  south  canal,  Shandong  Province  in  the  territory  known as  Lu  Yunhe,  Jiangsu  Yangtze  River  in  the  North  called  the canal  and  the  Canal  and  the  Yangtze  south  to  Qiantang  River in  the  north  as  Jiangnan  Canal,  Qiantang  River  south  known as  "eastern  Zhejiang  canal"  to  end  the  Ningbo.  Yok  thus believe  that  Mr.  Chen  Qiao,  the  Grand  Canal  is  a  different name  in  rivers,  should  include  "Canal  eastern  Zhejiang  ". He  said,  eastern  Zhejiang  canal  before  Qin  Dynasty  period that  had  been  dug  up  on  the  artificial  canal  and  link  to ancient  times  and  the  Beijing-Hangzhou  Canal.  Song,  Korai a  lot  of  merchants  to  China,  Japan,  Ningbo  arrived  by  sea, and  from  Ningbo  to  Zhenhai  Yao  Yu,  away  from  eastern  Zhejiang Hangzhou  Canal  canal,  and  then  North.  The  Ming  and  Qing era,  also  from  Hangzhou  East  pedestrian  Qiantang  River  to the  mountain  peak,  Linpu  lock  to  enter  eastern  Zhejiang  canal Shaoxing  core  rivers  to  the  south.  South  China's  eastern Zhejiang  canal,  where  they  no  longer  any  others  River  labour movement.  Yok  that  Chen  Qiao,  eastern  Zhejiang  canal  should be  subordinate  to  Grand  Canal,  is  China's  southern  tip  of the  Grand  Canal,  along  the  river  ancient  culture  and  heritage many  great  character.  And  in  the  past,  the  canal  while  nobody mentioned.
