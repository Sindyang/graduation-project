China's  "International  Herald  leader"  Europe  first  published by  the  State  Council  development  research  center  The  Tong Gang  wrote  an  article  entitled  "War  and  oil  need  insulating ",  which  is  transmitted  as  follows  :  War-End  First  World markets  and  the  Iraqi  war  situation  of  Hu  Dongxing  markedly strengthened.  First  two  days,  in  the  war  is  expected  to be  quick,  the  US  unit  sharp  rise  in  oil  prices  drop.  The attack  with  the  action  blocked,  pessimistic  forecast  and  re-build-ups, and  the  possibility  of  higher  oil  prices  again  remains  high. Thus,  a  huge  oil  reserves  in  Iraq,  future  appears  to  be an  element  of  the  world  economy.  What  is  really  so  ?  (subtitle) stems  from  psychological  factors  market  fears  More  generally, there  is  no  denying  that  the  world's  oil  factors,  including long-term  curbed  Iraqi  oil.  However,  this  cannot  be  formed in  the  short  term  and  a  role  to  play.  The  market  between the  war  with  Iraq's  steps  toward  better  relations  are  not expected  to  be  identified.  The  current  oil  market  panic  and the  stock  market  fluctuations,  changes  in  the  major  psychological factors.  Since  economic  fundamentals,  entered  since  February this  year,  the  market  and  did  not  see  new  structural  changes. At  the  same  time,  although  the  international  oil  market  Preheat by  war,  the  latest  data  show  that  the  international  oil production  and  consumption  gap  of  only  1  %,  remained  in 7600  to  77  million  barrels  per  day.  Economic  fundamentals and  there  was  no  oil  supply  and  demand  new  shocks,  the market  for  corporate  financial  scandal,  layoffs,  Iraq,  including the  Korean  nuclear  crisis  have  been  used  in  part  the  effects of  these  incidents  have  been  released.  The  Iraqi  issue,  for example,  "was  the"  War  is  expected  to  be  seething  enough has  been  speculation  from  Bush  to  tell  inadvertently  Crusaders East  with  a  new  date,  the  world  economy  has  been  a  substantial damage.  At  a  time  when  the  Iraqi  war  situation  changes, but  is  expected  to  realize  it.  Of  course,  if  the  war  is not  expected  towards  the  direction  of  development,  will  not only  to  oil  prices  are  expected  to  be  more  negative  direction, and  will  stimulate  structural  factors  deteriorating,  the  world economic  recovery  period  will  also  be  extended.  (subtitle) factors  oil  will  not  be  decided  While  it  was  possible  that the  Russian  oil  and  other  European  countries  such  as  France and  Germany  opposed  to  the  US  force  "was  the"  one  of  the reasons,  but  this  factor  in  different  countries  have  a  different meaning,  the  focus  of  attention  is  focused,  and  would  not affect  the  major  an  important  factor  in  the  country's  economy. The  European  countries,  although  the  war  is  expected  to  be long-term,  because  the  rise  in  crude  oil  prices  and  was damaged,  but  the  oil  companies,  such  as  BP,  ENI,  through the  overseas  capital  expansion  has  already  opened  up  new markets,  the  actual  oil  consumption  can  be  guaranteed  not to  mention  the  fact  that  individual  countries,  such  as  Norway have  been  a  fully  developed  external  resources,  and  in  total revenue  from  domestic  resources  development  "on  behalf  of the  fund  under  a"  period.  The  price  of  crude  oil  for  the European  economy  is  a  major  impact  in  the  processing  link, and  this  can  be  found  through  stock  placement.  (subtitle) solution  is  cooperation,  dialogue  The  above  analysis  indicates that  the  war  -  Oil-economic  fundamentals  triangular  relationship is  not  a  result  of  the  changes,  which  is  a  big  psychological expectations  as  a  result  of  the  war.  If  this  conclusion was  established,  it  may  also  address  plight  of  the  fundamental way  out.  First,  the  OPEC  should  not  continue  the  positive role  in  the  international  energy  market  to  belittle.  Otherwise it  will  further  stimulate  market  prices.  The  OPEC,  under the  present  circumstances,  not  only  is  not  a  high-price  oil dollars,  but  also  for  its  market  share  further  blow.  Non-OPEC oil  producing  countries  such  as  Russia  because  of  its  production capacity  is  approaching  the  limit,  but  equally  to  profits. The  rise  in  oil  prices  can  only  benefit  western  oil  capital, and  the  marginal  oil  consumption  for  the  rapid  rise  in  the country's  oil  demand  will  also  have  a  significant  weakening. In  fact,  from  the  Afghanistan  war  and  the  attitude  of  the Iraqi  oil  during  the  war,  the  organization  is  worthy  of a  critical  time  in  the  world  oil  market  "stabilizer  ".  Secondly, OPEC  is  facing  increasingly  fierce  competition  in  international oil  markets  is  an  indisputable  fact.  At  the  international sanctions  on  Iraq's  long-term,  his  volatile  situation  in  the market  share  of  the  threats,  is  to  survive  only  seek  a new  way  out.  To  change  the  flow  of  oil  dollars  to  form a  new  income  -  Capital  return  mechanism  that  OPEC  must  be taken  into  account.  I  believe  that  many  countries  will  be of  interest.  Finally,  if  the  United  States  can  control  process of  war  throughout  the  post-war's  largest  makers  seem  to  be difficult  to  Luobie,  the  United  States  will  increase  oil supply  factors.  Taking  into  account  the  needs  of  the  United States  to  meet  their  own  (  May  2001  under  the  Bush  administration announced  the  "Outline  energy"  in  2040  the  United  States will  bring  the  current  oil  imports  from  11  million  barrels per  day  to  23  million  barrels,  the  fundamental  reversal  of the  Middle  East  energy  flow.  On  the  contrary,  if  we  continue to  strengthen  "down  the"  oil  prices  and  the  world  economic relations  between  the  full  transmission,  then  all  the  countries would  be  affected,  and  can  only  be  unproductive  rent-seeking international  speculative  capital.
