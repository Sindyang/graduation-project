Iraqi  asylum  where  cultural  relics  Xinhua  News  Agency  reporters Zhang  Xiaojun  and  Li  Xuemei  Zhang  Zhongxia  The  US  military attacks  on  Iraq,  not  only  caused  a  large  number  of  casualties among  innocent  civilians,  also  a  threat  to  Iraq's  ancient civilization  valuable  cultural  monuments.  Iraq's  cultural  heritage in  this  war  has  become  a  cause  for  concern.  Iraq's  history of  civilization,  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States  is  located in  the  year  4000,  the  earliest  human  civilization  was  born. American  historians  Klein  silent  in  his  book  "history  began with  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States,"  cited  by  the Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States  in  the  history  of  mankind civilization,  27  of  the  "first  world  ",  such  as  agricultural village,  built  a  1  1  cities,  the  first  ship,  vehicle  and invention  ".  It  is  estimated  that  cultural  sites  in  Iraq there  may  be  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people.  However,  in 1991  in  the  Gulf  War,  Iraq  and  many  cultural  heritage  sites Museum  damaged.  Iraq  Ould  region  with  a  one-year-old  royal tomb  from  the  4500  bombing  of  US  military  planes  were  damaged and  four  on  the  ground  has  left  a  huge  crater,  more  than 400  on  the  walls  were  bullet  holes.  The  Joint  Chiefs  of Staff  deputy  defense  minister  Mccristal  March  29,  from  Iraq since  the  beginning  of  the  war,  the  United  States  and  Britain to  Allied  forces  launched  675  missiles  in  Iraq  "Tomahawk" cruise-missile,  fired  more  than  6,000  have  been  dropped  precision-guided bombs.  March  31,  the  United  States  has  deployed  an  unprecedented and-B,  and  strategic  bomber  strikes  Iraqi  targets,  reports from  the  front  line,  Bombs  Rock  Hill  mobilizing  is  located. In  the  face  of  such  heavy  bombardment,  it  is  most  concerned about  Iraq's  cultural  monuments  be  able  to  cope  with  the devastation  of  the  brutal  war.  The  University  of  Chicago professor  at  the  MCGWYRE  Gibson  said  recently  that  Iraq  "alarming" historical  and  cultural  wealth  if  the  war-damaged,  it  would be  "the  tragedy  of  the  whole  world  ".  The  Iraqi  side  statistics, during  the  Gulf  War  and  post-war,  Iraqi  museums  and  archaeological sites  and  archaeological  relics  found  there  were  2,264  products as  well  as  some  20,000  precious  manuscripts  looted.  And  the worst  thing  is  that  sites  were  looted,  even  to  find  the missing  objects,  precious  materials  are  also  missing.  In  March this  year,  well-known  of  Iraq's  National  Museum  four  doors closed,  each  door  are  a  pile  up  sandbags,  when  it  can  be re-opened  to  visitors  is  not  known.  Museums  valuable  even inside  the  city  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States, sculptures,  frescoes  and  some  of  the  stone  inscription  cuneiform writing  of  ancient  tombs  gold  and  silver  products.  UNESCO officials  responsible  for  cultural  affairs  of  the  Boucheix Munir  Nike,  March  27,  said  that  Iraq  war  in  the  first  week in  Baghdad,  Tikrit  and  Mosul  in  all  the  museums  were  damaged. Ancient  city  of  Mosul  and  precious  wealth  museum  items,  including several  centuries  before  Christ  sculptures,  board  and  other artifacts.  Baghdad,  the  museum's  collection  of  treasures  from the  recent  Iraqi  royal  family.  Some  European  and  American academic  institutions  have  been  attempting  to  the  US  Defense Department  to  allow  Iraq  to  recognize  the  importance  of  cultural relics  in  the  world.  These  bodies  to  the  US  military  has submitted  more  than  4,000  Iraqi  Cultural  Monuments  location information  to  combat  against  the  military.  There  is  no  doubt that  war  itself  will  directly  threaten  the  security  of  Iraq's cultural  monuments,  but  the  damage  suffered  by  post-war  monuments even  more  alarming.  Prior  to  1990,  Iraq  has  an  enviable cultural  heritage  protection  system.  The  severe  "Heritage  Law ",  the  Iraqi  antiquities  department  administers  all  of  the cultural  sites  and  objects,  the  national  did  not  find  any illegal  archaeological  digs  and  relics  smuggling  activities. However,  since  the  Gulf  War,  Iraq's  cultural  sector  owing to  a  shortage  of  funds,  unable  to  pay  wages  to  dismiss many  sites  security  personnel,  and  even  Babylon,  Ninawa,  some of  the  major  sites  were  also  negligent  in  custody,  theft and  can  be  easily  removed  several  tonnes  of  cultural  relics, and  smuggling  groups  inside  and  outside  the  collusion  between the  phenomenon  of  cultural  relics  made  unauthorized  excavation near  spread  continuously  losing  large  relics  illegally  entered international  markets.  Now,  as  long  as  we  harbour  electronic auction  site  in  the  United  States  (eBAY)  Search  "Russia  and the  United  States,"  or  "cuneiform  writing  ",  it  was  found that  many  outflow  of  cultural  treasures  from  Iraq  are  being sold  on  the  Internet.  Leaving  the  painful  lessons  of  the Gulf  War,  Iraq  in  the  transfer  to  begin  before  the  outbreak of  war  in  the  distribution  in  the  ruins  of  cultural  relics, and  with  UNESCO  and  consultations  on  how  to  protect  cultural heritage  for  the  war  may  be  the  protection  of  cultural  heritage to  minimize  the  damage  caused.
