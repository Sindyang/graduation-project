As long  as  complying  with  national  laws  and  regulations,  the Chinese  people  have  the  freedom  to  any  place,  want  to  do any  freedom.  Hungarian  ambassador  to  China  that  Mr.  Bai  Mingyi: In  the  past  few  decades,  China's  human  rights  situation  has changed  dramatically.

Hungary  is ready  to  share  in  the  past  10  years  China  to  democracy, rule  of  law  and  a  market  economy  in  transition  experience. China  and  Hungary,  two  traditional  friends  of  the  modern history  of  the  challenges  in  the  past  have  much  in  common. This  is  why  our  two  countries  in  the  cause  of  human  rights dialogue  initiated  in  2000.  We  believe  that  open  and  constructive exchange  with  the  Chinese  human  rights  issues  beneficial  to both  countries.  Hungary's  experience  has  shown  that  well-functioning market  economy  and  the  rule  of  law  are  closely  linked,  because only  in  an  orderly  market  mechanism  and  reliable  legal  environment.

Acosta's  visit  to  China, and  Chinese  officials  and  human  rights  organizations  have carried  out  a  series  of  fruitful  talks.  Such  a  dialogue we  have  identified  as  priority.  During  his  visit  to  Mexico to  China  in  protecting  and  promoting  people's  rights  to  subsistence and  development,  protection  of  minorities  and  giving  them broad  autonomy,  freedom  of  religious  belief,  the  progress achieved  left  a  deep  impression.  As  a  developing  country, both  held  that  human  rights  should  not  be  used  as  interference in  internal  affairs  under  the  pretext  of  any  country.
