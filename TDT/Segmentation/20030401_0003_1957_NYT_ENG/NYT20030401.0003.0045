Rebecca Nakabazzi's son Julius is going to become an AIDS orphan. Right now the shy 11-year-old lives at home with his mother, who is frail and feverish but still very much a doting mother. But all too soon, _ it could be weeks or months or even years _ she will die and the number of AIDS orphans in Africa, estimated at 11 million, will increase by one. Nakabazzi is taking no chances when it comes to Julius' memory of her. During her remaining time with her son, she is preparing a book of memories that she hopes he will treasure throughout his life. ``I want you to study and to go to university and to be responsible,'' Nakabazzi, a 30-year-old former hairdresser and seamstress now too sick to work, has written in her book, advice she wants him to remember when she is not here to deliver it in person. Borrowing an idea from cancer patients in Britain, health workers in Uganda are urging dying parents like Nakabazzi to preserve memories for their children. Part photo album and part diary, memory books are becoming an increasingly popular way for dying Africans to continue coddling their beloved offspring from the grave. Since Uganda adopted memory books in the mid-1990s, hundreds have been passed on to newly orphaned children. The idea has spread to neighboring Kenya and to other countries throughout a continent hit hard by AIDS, where tradition is often handed down face to face through stories and songs and ceremonies. AIDS has interrupted that pattern all too often, leaving many youngsters with shaky cultural roots. Many of Africa's orphans, and there are more on this continent than anywhere else, have only the vaguest memories of their lost parents, if they remember them at all. They do not know their birthplaces. At tender ages the children are shunted off to relatives, orphanages or foster families, with many siblings separated in the process. In the worst cases, children are left to fend for themselves. The memories they hold on to can be unpleasant ones. The parents the orphans keep in their heads may be weak skeletons barely able to function, who drift off into perpetual sleep. ``I accept that I'm going to die,'' Nakabazzi said one recent morning, propping herself up in bed while Julius was off at school on the outskirts of this city, Uganda's capital. ``I've come to realize that it's a normal thing. We're all going to die. For me, though, it will happen while Julius is still young.'' So she uses the book to tell him the things she wants him to remember _ life lessons, a mother's impressions and a family history that he may be too young to absorb fully just now. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Writing in Luganda, the country's major indigenous language, and English, she recounts her own childhood and that of Julius' father, who died when Julius was 2, also of AIDS. She tells Julius where he was born and when he took his first steps. Her deep religious convictions come out in the form of Bible verses. ``You resembled your father and at the same time me, so you are a mirror of both of us,'' she writes to the boy, reminding him that he loves to watch wrestling on television. ``You are supportive,'' she says on a page devoted to things she loves about him. ``You would ask: `Are you sick? You're not feeling well? Sorry.' '' She includes photographs of Julius' childhood and the family he might otherwise not remember so well. There is his father standing by Julius' side and other smiling relatives, who have also died of AIDS. There is a photograph of Juliusooks themselves are ordinary binders with plastic pages that allow written messages, photographs or anything else with sentimental value to be stuck inside. But there is nothing ordinary about the contents. They capture the ups and downs of difficult lives, poor families struggling to get by only to be overcome by the devastation of a cruel disease. Putting together such a book can be an all-encompassing task, often taking every spare moment until that time when the ownership of the book shifts to the child. It can be emotionally draining. It requires a great deal of thought. Tracking down photographs and anecdotes from relatives takes energy that AIDS patients have in short supply. (END OPTIONAL TRIM) Parents who have completed the memory books say the process can be joyful as one recalls long-forgotten memories, but sad as well, as one confronts the fact that death is looming. AIDS sufferers are encouraged to disclose their disease to their children, which can be more than many parents can bear. But the books can mean so much to the children left behind. Losing one's parents is always traumatic, but advocates of the books say they can help reduce the emotional void orphans face in the future, even if their own futures are also cut short by the virus, as is often the case. Julius himself has been diagnosed with the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS organizations offer training classes before encouraging patients to begin the process. They discuss ``permanent separation,'' a euphemism for death. They try to break down the stigma still associated with the disease, despite its widespread nature. They also underscore that people ought to prepare for death. ``You can't leave your children with half-baked information from your deathbed,'' said Dorothy Namutamba, a Ugandan who teaches seminars on memory books for the National Community of Women Living with HIV and AIDS. ``You must prepare when you're still strong enough. Don't wait until you're so weak you can't open your lips.'' At a recent training session on the books held in western Uganda, those taking part were urged to write wills and designate guardians so the children know who is going to raise them when they become parentless. Memory books, as well, ought to be begun well before death is looming. ``When we die, a lot of memories can fade away with us,'' Nakabazzi said, pausing frequently and rubbing her head. ``The family history can disappear. I want Julius to always remember his mother.''
