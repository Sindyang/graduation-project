In World War II, they purchased more bonds and planted ``Victory Gardens'' at home to release food supplies for troops. Now, as the war in Iraq enters a potentially protracted phase and the fight against terrorism continues, some people are calling for a return to large-scale public sacrifice. They contend such efforts would promote unity and answer Americans' desire to be more involved in protecting their country. But there is little unanimity about what civilian sacrifice should entail, and plenty of suggestion that past endeavors are anachronistic today. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush has urged Americans to go about their daily lives and not succumb to fears about terrorism. He also created the USA Freedom Corps to provide more opportunities for citizens to perform volunteer work. Kenneth Pollack( q"senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said the president should be requiring much more of the public. He suggested that Americans should be purchasing war bonds, among other things. ``We're really going to need to give a bit back to the collective entity of the United States in order to safeguard ourselves,'' said Pollack, a widely quoted authority on the Iraq war. ``I think that the administration has not done a very good job all along in making that clear, and I think what's going on in Iraq is part of that.'' (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)@ Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who is among the Democrats seeking to challenge Bush in 2004, agreed that Americans need new ways to become involved. He has promoted legislation that would enable young people to serve 18 months in the military and a longer stint with the reserves in exchange for college tuition money. Lieberman also is considering creating ``Homeland Security Bonds'' that could finance domestic anti-terrorism efforts. Since December 2001, the government has been selling ``Patriot Bonds'' _ a retitled series of bonds that is not earmarked for counterterrorism activities. ``Soldiers are sacrificing in Iraq, so we need to sacrifice _ foT$for the sake of sacrifice, but in dealing with the war on terrorism,'' Lieberman said. (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)@ Critics argue that enough is being asked of Americans _ and that society has evolved to the point that it need not follow old wartime modes of behavior. ``I already lived through the period where we got three gallons of gas a week, we got two pairs of shoes, one suit a year,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the 75-year-old chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``When do we stop?'' To Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington think tank, pushing for large-scale self-sacrifice during wartime is essentially ``self-flagellation without purpose.'' ``If there's a reason to do these kinds of things, we shouldn't be doing them under fraudulent pretenses,'' said Bandow, a nationally syndicated political columnist. ``To say that we should serve other people, you should make the argument that service is a good thing and that we have responsibilities to one another _ not because we're worried about al-Qaida.'' All too often, measures of civilian self-sacrifice are used to promote other rry Craig, R-Idaho, a conservative who wants to reduce government spending, said he would like to see non-defense domestic programs cut by 1 percent across the board this year to demonstrate the seriousness of the war's impact on the economy. ``Many of those who are coming to Washington to lobby me for different projects and programs are giving me the indication that they're expecting less than they otherwise might get because of this extraordinary situation,'' Craig said. On the opposite end of the political spectrum, some congressional Democrats say that if Bush is serious about self-sacrifice he should withdraw his proposal to cut taxes by $670 billion, an initiative they contend will benefit only the richest Americans. ``That budget of his certainly didn't call for mutual sacrifice,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. Such divergent opinions occurred less often in previous wars, when there was greater unanimity of public opinion. Historians say civilian sacrifice in those eras was usually _ but not always _ voluntary. President Herbert Hoover, who served as federal food administrator during World War I, called on restaurants to stop serving bread and had children eat ``patriotic potatoes'' instead of sandwiches with their school lunches. In World War II, the government engaged in stronger measures such as the rationing of steel, copper, oil and rubber. It wrote rules for, among other things, printing books with smaller margins so that paper would not be wasted. ``We seem to have returned to a period a bit like the 18th century, when wars were fought entirely by professional armies with civilians pretty much able to ignore the fact that we were at war,'' said James Hoopes, an American history professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. But the Bush administration's top official on public service strongly disagrees. Leslie Lenkowsky, chief executive officer of the Corporation for National Community Service, said plenty is being done in the name of sacrifice, citing the ongoing emergency response training and disaster preparedness efforts under way in cities ranging from New York to Mather, Calif. ``The notion that somehow Americans have a free ride here is wrong,'' Lenkowsky said. ``People should remember that we already are making lots of sacrifice _ there are people with relatives in the military who are not with their loved ones and kids. And anyone who travels these days is operating under restraints.'' To that end, Lenkowsky encouraged Americans to be content with small gestures of sacrifice: ``Here we are in Iraq fighting for democracy when people don't know quite enough about democracy. So turn off the TV and read a book about American history.'' LF END McCUTCHEON (Chuck McCutcheon can be contacted at chuck.mccutcheon(at)newhouse.com)
