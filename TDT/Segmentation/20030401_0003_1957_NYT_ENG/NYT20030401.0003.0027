RECALLING THE BRUTAL SIDE OF WARFARE@&lt; Commentary@&lt; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)@&lt; By JOAN RYAN@= c.2003 San Francisco Chronicle@= NOVATO, Calif. _ Even 60 years later, they can't speak of things they saw during the war. They are old men now. One carves gorgeous duck decoys in his retirement. He still hunts and fishes. The other has been slowed by heart problems. They watch the images now on television of another generation of troops who are much like they were. Young. Scared. Proud. Horrified. The sorting-out process, separating the haunting from the beautiful, the exhilarating from the gruesome, continues still, as if the memories are so extreme and contradictory they don't slip neatly into the brain's filing system. Yet Bill Neal says of his military service, ``Mt0uas the greatest experience in the world.'' He is the decoy carver. He is a little hard of hearing and speaks softly, as if accustomed to the quiet of his own company. William Garner nods. ``I think it makes you a better man,'' Neal continues. We're sitting at a table in an empty room of the Margaret Todd Senior Center in Novato. Both live nearby. Neal served in the Army during World War II, working as a gunner on bombers over Germany. Garner was a boatswain in the Navy, fighting in the Pacific. They recall the most minute details of their experiences, like baseball heroes recounting the particulars of every game. They share mostly the funny stories and the stories about famous battles. Garner tells how he served with all three generations of McCain men, first in World War II, then Korea and Vietnam. He talks about Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima. Neal tells of the three fellow POWs who made their own liquor out of dried fruit and sugar and got so drunk that the next morning, with the three out cold, their stalag mates tied them into chairs and lined them up outside so they wouldn't miss roll call. Neal laughs softly at the story, which is smooth and polished from retelling. He won't say much else about the POW camp in Germany, where he spent a year, or about the 289-mile, 19-day forced march tto tell you, things that would make your stomach turn,'' he says. ``It stays with you. This group over in Iraq now will bring back some bad memories. Some of them will crack under the strain.'' He saw momentary video clips of the POWs taken in Iraq last week. He knew the look of absolute fear, of wondering if a minute from now you'll get a bullet in the head. ``I thought, `Oh those poor guys,'' Neal says. He and Garner say they hate war, as they say any reasonable person does, but they support the decision to oust Saddam and his weaponry. ``Better now than later,'' Garner says. Yet they also know that the men and women fighting there will return home changed. They'll carry pieces of the war like shrapnel. When Garner goes to Navy reunions and talks about the old days with his mates, he says there are long minutes when the group falls silent. ``You know everybody is remembering. There are memories that just tear at you. You don't even talk about them to each other. There are stories I have never even told my wife. You live with them for the rest of your life. They touch your soul forever.'' We think we're seeing the war on television. But 60 years from now, when old men sit around recounting the war in Iraq, they'll fall silent sometimes, too, like Garner and Neal, remembering the stories that are never told. ___@&lt; E-mail: joanryan(at)sfchronicle.com
