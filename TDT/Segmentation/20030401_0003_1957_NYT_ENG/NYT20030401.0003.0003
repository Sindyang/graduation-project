The demolition crew came under the cover of night to carve up the runway of the little lakefront airport that ha of downtown, wanted it transformed into a picturesque lakeside park. Friends of Meigs Field, a collection of businessmen and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, had long fought the closing of the tiny airport, contending that it was a vital link for business commuters. The fate of Meigs Field had seemed more secure since an agreement reached in December 2001 by Daley and George Ryan, who was then the governor, to keep it open until 2026 under a plan to expand O'Hare International Airport. But that deal is apparently stalled in Congress, if not altogether dead at the federal level, because of opposition to the expansion of O'Hare. Daley now deems the closing of Meigs Field to be a matter of domestic security, and he ordered the bulldozers in. Unannounced to the public, city workers moved in overnight _ even as private planes sat parked along the runway _ and started digging. So as the sun rose on Monday morning, broken chunks of concrete carved in the shape of X's along the length of the runway marked where workers had set about destroying Meigs Field. At a news conference on Monday, Daley said closing the airport ``will make Chicago a safer city.'' ``There hqr`neen no specific threat,'' he said. ``As mayor of the city of Chicago, public safety is one of my primary responsibilities. I take it very seriously.'' After the Sept. 11 attacks, Daley closed Meigs Field for several weeks. On Monday he said, ``I am not willing to wait for a tragedy, as some have asked me to do, to happen before making a very difficult and tough decision.'' While it was not clear how the 16 small planes parked on Monday at Meigs Field would be removed, Daley said the city would reimburse the planes' owners for their expenses in removing them. The airport is owned by the Chicago Park District. The surprise shutdown of the airport, which was operating last weekend, set off protests from those who awoke to find the city's lone downtown airport with its wings clipped. ``The City of Chicago today used surprise and shock tactics to start demolishing Meigs Field, the world-renowned airport serving downtown, ripping up runway without notice in the dark of night under police guard,'' Friends of Meigs Field announced on its Web site. The organization estimates that the tiny airport handles 30,000 to 40,000 private flights a year. (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said: ``We were absolutely shocked and dismayed. We can think of no compelling reason for closing this airport. If there was a real concern here, why did they have to sneak in like a thief in the night?'' In fact, opponents of the closure contended that Meigs was a safeguard against possible terrorism. ``By closing the airport, the mayor has also closed the control tower. When aircraft were flying in the vicinity of Meigs Field they had 4o Bontact air traffic control; now they don't,'' said Morningstar, who says that the small aircraft that fly in and out of Meigs pose little potential threat. Because of the the runway length and its weight-bearing capability only small general aviation aircraft can use the field, he said, adding, ``They're incapable of doing damage to major structures.'' At the mayor's behest, federal authorities nearly two weeks ago imposed temporary flight restrictions over the downtown area. But that action, the mayor said Monday, ``does not address the problem that occurs every day as aircraft approach Meigs Field, within a few hundred yards and only a few seconds' flight time of our tallest buildings.'' Northerly Ksd`nd, where the airport is located, was formed from a landfill in the 1920s. /24oaring into blue skies over the waters of Lake Michigan. Congressional approval of a $6.6 billion O'Hare expansion plan which calls for Meigs to remain open until 2026, reached by Ryan and Daley, appears unlikely. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., has vowed to launch a filibuster to block approval of the bill that would prevent future Illinois governors from using state law to block expansion. A spokeswoman for the mayor said on Monday that Daley had no immediate plans for the land. On Monday afternoon, with more than a dozen airplanes stranded at the airport, supporters vowed to keep fighting. ``We are still working to save Meigs Field,'' said Rachel Goodstein, president of the Friends of Meigs Field. ``I don't know that the mayor will really get away with this.'' But even some of the staunchest of supporters of the airport admit that with Meigs' lone runway in ruins, their hopes are slim. ``The mayor closed the airport because he could, and there is probably not an awful lot that anyone can do about that,'' said Morningstar.
