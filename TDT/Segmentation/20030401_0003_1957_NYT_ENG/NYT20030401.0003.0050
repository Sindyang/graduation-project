The US-led war on Iraq might finally solve the national mystery that for a dozen years has darkened the tranquility of this sun- and oil-drenched emirate. There are 605 Kuwaitis who never returned home and were never accounted for, after being taken prisoner by Iraq during its brief invasion of Kuwait. The open question of their fate in a desert nation smaller than New Jersey is perhaps even more deeply felt here than the issue of Vietnam War POWs and MIAs has been in the United States. Families of the prisoners of war are anxiously awaiting the news of their loved ones that is expected to come with the presumptive fall of Baghdad. Even if they are dead, most will be grateful to have an answer after more than a decade of questions. But many cling to the possibility that some of the missing are still alive. The US forces massing outside Baghdad have prompted hopes of reunification but also fears that the prisoners might be used as human shields or killed as a last-ditch act of cruelty by Saddam Hussein's regime. On the eve of war, Latifa Ibrahim Swaidan, an ailing 68=y%ir-old widow, had a dream about her missing daughter, Daad Omar al-Harini. In the dream al-Harini was healthy, smiling, and surrounded by bright white sheets. ``Either I'm going to see her again on white sheets, or that was her burial shroud,'' said Swaidan. Some 7,000 Kuwaitis _ sometimes whole families at a time _ were detained and taken to Iraq during the occupation by Hussein's forces in 1990 and 1991, according to Abdul Hamid al-Attar, a senior official with the National Committee for Missing and POW Affairs. Most of them were civilians accused of resisting the Iraqi occupation. Often, like al-Harini, they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. The majority of the prisoners were released either through the intervention of the Red Cross or under the cease fire that ended the Gulf War. Yet some people simply never materialized. ``We waited several months. We waited for an answer _ where were the rest?'' said al-Attar, whose son is a POW. ``And the answer came from Saddam Hussein _ I don't have any more.'' Iraqi senior officials, saying they released all of their prisoners of war, have never cooperated with efforts to locate them _ although they reopened talks a few months ago, in an apparent attempt to win public support for heading off a US invasion of Iraq. Al-Harini was a 32-year-old mother of three when she disappeared. As a Lebanese national, she had less reason to be fearful in leaving the house than did Kuwaiti citizens during the occupation. So one day she brought some food supplies to Kuwaiti neighbors. She had been in their house for 15 minutes when Iraqi soldiers barged in and arrested word of her since. Al-Harini's husband remarried and moved to the United States with the children. It is an option not availaand's death. Over the past 12 years, the POW issue has been woven deeply into the Kuwaiti national psyche. Flags and banners wave as constant reminders, though few need much reminding. Kuwait has a population of 2.1 million with only 800,000 of them Kuwaiti citizens, so most every national has some personal connection to the cause. ``Everybody in Kuwait, every house, The prisoners who were released from Iraqi jails came back with harrowing tales of torture. ``I've never told this to anyone,'' Swaidan said. ``I would rather that she had died back then than that she survive every day a thousand deaths.'' Still, many have dreams that their family members will one day return. As bad as it looks, one thing that gives them hope is the fact that Iraq denied for years that it held thousands of prisoners of war from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war _ until it re.leased at least some of them. Last month, Iraq freed more than 250 Iranian prisoners, and Iran turned over nearly 400. The Kuwaiti government plans to press the issue in other ways. The matter of the missing Kuwaitis has been placed on the United Nation Security Council calendar for discussion later this month. Al-Attar's son, Jamal, a 26-year-old radio engineer, was accused of serving in the resistance movement. The day Jamal was captured, his father and sisters went to the police station looking for him. Even though al-Attar saw his son's Jeep Suzuki, the guard denied they had the young man in custody. ``You want your son or the car?'' taunted one officer. Then al-Attar heard Jamal say, ``No father, I'm here, don't believe them.'' One of the sisters came running, and the guard fired warning shots at her feet. The family fled, and when al-Attar returned a few hours later, he was told his son had been transferred. ``From then until today _ that was the last thing we knew of him,'' al-Attar said. ``I can't tell you how much I miss him.''
