I've always been convijcuf that the trick to living in Massachusetts is to stay in the spring, summer, and fall and leave in the winter. But I have changed my mind. Now I think the trick is to stay during the economic booms and leave during the busts. They are nastier than the winters. For the second straight economic downturn, Massachusetts has earned a dubious distinction: It has lost a greater percentage of its jobs than any other state in the nation. According to Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies, between January 2001 and January 2003, the first two years of this slowdown, Massachusetts lost 157,000 jobs, or 4.7 percent of its total employment. No other state lost as much as 4 percent. In the slump that lasted from 1989 to 1992, Massachusetts lost 11.6 percent of its jobs, which tied it with Rhode Island for the worst employment record in the country. In both downturns, Massachusetts lost a far greater share of its jobs than the country as a whole.Do you think we could put that on our license plates? ``Massachusetts: Where Jobs Disappear.'' The poor performance doesn't square with the state's image of itself. Nor does it lend itself to any obvious explanation. Is it plain old bad luck? The curse of the Bambino? Or is there something more profound at work that makes Massachusetts more economically fragile than other states? On the surface, the current slump and the slump of the early 1990s don't have a lot in common. Kn(uhe words of Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp., the recession that hit more than a decade ago was largely ``made in Massachusetts.'' The state's big computer companies missed the personal computer revolution, a mistake that cost them profits and jobs. The end of the Cold War led to downsizing in the defense industry. Those events put the brakes on a booming real estate and construction market, which in turn, dragged down much of the local banking industry. It was a n)uclear-style chain reaction that destroyed almost everyt|&gt;[e the nation experienced a modest recession. The current slowdown had its origins in the national stock market boom of the 1990s. When the bubble burst three years ago, two industries, technology and finance, suddenly found themselves vulnerable. It just so happens that those two industries are pillars of the Massachusetts economy. The state has lost a big chunk of its technology jobs, both manufacturing and service. Also gone are the jobs of thousands of people who profited from the boom _ everyone from accountants to lawyers to consultants. Still to come: public sector layoffs as state government copes with the fiscal crisis the economic crisis has generated. No one is really sure what links the state's two downturns, but in a search for common ground, two things stand out. The first is that Massachusetts has an economy that apparently is susceptible to bubbles. ``In both the 1980s and 1990s,'' said Paul Harrington, a Northeastern University economist, ``we got caught up in speculation.'' In the 1980s, the speculation was in real estate; more recently it was in stocks. Like a rider on a steep roller coaster, Massachusetts soared on the way up and plunged on the way down, an unsettling experience. The other link between the slumps is technology. Technology is the ultimate source of growth. The states that don't have it want it desperately. But technology is inherently volatile. The new new thing inevitably gets replaced by something even newer. And in a competitive world, the next generation of products comes around faster than ever. ``If we are going to rely on technology, we have to understand that there will be fallow times,'' said Breimyer. Massachusetts will be back. Its mix of businesses _ technology, finance, and healthcare _ are the industries of the future. Trouble is, the future hasn't arrived yet, and in the meantime life isn't so rosy here in the state of unemployment. @Charles Stein is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at stein(at)globe.com. @
