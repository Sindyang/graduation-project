Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Tuesday that he was launching a new effort to reunite the Turkish and Greek sectors of Cyprus, a development that could enhance Turkey's frustrated bid to join the European Union. Erdogan said that his foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, would visit Cyprus on Thursday to talk with Turkish Cypriot leaders there, and that he and Gul would discuss the issue with Greek ,maders at a Balkans summit in Belgrade next week. ``We're not about to give up on searching for a solution,'' Erdogan told lawmakers here on Tuesday, referring to the collapse last month of a reunification deal promoted by Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations. ``We want to make new initiatives, new openings,'' said the prime minister. He did not provide any details on what Turkey would propose or how it would differ from the U.N. plan, which called for two ``constituent'' states under a central govey, and European Union officials have said that in the absence of a settlement, the union will admit only the Greek part of Cyprus into the union next year, when 10 new countries are scheduled to join. If that happens, it would diminish Turkey's chances of future membership. Turkey has not yet been given a firm start date for membership talks and already faces plenty of obstacles. European Union officials have long complained about Turkey's record on human rights, especially its treatment of ethnic Kurds, and are watching closely for any movement by Turkish troops into the Kurdish region of Iraq during the war there. They have warned those troops away, saying Turkey's future membership in the union could be at stake. At the same time, the war has badly damaged Turkey's relationship with the United States, leaving the country's western alliances on shaky ground. Erdogan's announcement about Cyprus raised the possibility that Turkey's rift with the United States would prod it to reach out more aggressively to Europe. ``If Turkey manages to alienate both the EU and the U.S., then it's got no friends at all in the world,'' said Heather Grabbe, an expert on European expansion at the Center for European Reform in London. ``Turkey doesn't have a lot of friends to play with,'' Grabbe said. ``It's a really critical moment, when Turks have decisions to make about how their future foreign policy is going to work.'' While Turkish Cypriots seem to be strongly in favor of the reunification of Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, has been an obstacle. Denktash has long been supported by Turkey's powerful generals, who see Cyprus as strategically valuable and are not close to Erdogan. ``There will be strong resistance to resolving this problem,'' said Rusen Cakir, a Turkish political analyst.
