North America's sawfish population has dwindled almost to extinction. The odd-looking cousins of stingrays with toothy snouts were caught in commercial nets and killed by anglers who wanted to keep their ``saws'' as trophies. Over-harvesting, combined with a loss of habitat and a slow system of reproduction _ sawfish become sexually mature around age 15 and give live birth to 12 to 15 pups every other year _ led to an estimated population loss of 95 percent during the past century. On Tuesday, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed the smalltooth sawfish as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, making it the first elasmobranch (sharks and other cartilaginous fish) and the first truly saltwater fish on the list. Other fish on the federal list, such as the Gulf sturgeon and the shortnose sturgeon, spend parts of their lives in fresh water. ``With this listing we hope that people will become more aware of this vulnerable sawfish and will help in our efforts to save it for future generations,'' said Bill Hogarth, assistant administrator for the fisheries service. Fisheries service scientists are working with scientists from Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, The Ocean Conservancy and the Florida Marine Research Institute on a management plan for sawfish. Part of the plan will designate critical habitat for sawfish, which could lead to restrictions on boaters in parts of Everglades National Park. Young sawfish live on shallow flats that protect them from sharks and other predators that lurk in deeper water. The habitat needs of sawfish in other stages of their lives remains largely unknown. During the late 1800s, sawfish were common on both coasts of Florida and ranged as far north as Chesapeake Bay and throughout the Gulf of Mexico. An Indian River Lagoon fisherman reported catching 300 sawfish in nets during a single season in the 1880s. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 sawfish remain, most of them in Everglades National Park. Florida regulators outlawed the sale and harvest of sawfish in 1992. The constitutional amendment that limited net fishing in Florida waters in 1995 further reduced the unintended killing of sawfish in nets, but the slow-to-mature sawfish remained in danger. In 1999, The Ocean Conservancy petitioned federal regulators to list the sawfish under the Endangered Species Act. ``It's sad to think it will take about a century to rebuild them, but this is likely the most important first step forward,'' said Sonja Fordham, a shark conservation specialist for The Ocean Conservancy. Fordham said she hopes the endangered species listing will encourage other nations to protect sawfish. The smalltooth sawfish in Florida is one of seven species found worldwide. ``They're in trouble everywhere they live,'' Fordham said. Willie Howard writes for The Palm Beach Post.
