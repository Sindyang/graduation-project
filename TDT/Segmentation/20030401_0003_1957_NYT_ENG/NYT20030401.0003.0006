The First Data Corp., a leading processor of credit card transactions and the owner of Western Union, is nearing a deal t/ @cquire Concord EFS Inc., which operates a large network of automated teller machines, for slightly more than $7 billion, executives close to the negotiations said Monday. The companies are hoping to complete the deal this week, though the executives stressed that several issues still need to be resolved and that the transaction could collapse. Under terms b closing price Monday. The deal would consolidate much of the nation's financial activity in First Data, which suffered a blow recently when Bank One said it would take its card processing business elsewhere. Executives close to the transaction said that the combination would create ``hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings'' as behind-the-scenes costs are eliminated and processing charges fall. Pressure has been mounting on Concord EFS, which also provides electronic transaction authorization, to complete a deal since word spread earlier last month that the company had put itself up for sale. This caused some investors to worry that Concord could be selling itself because it might lose its all-important bank network contracts. Concord EFS is renegotiating its contracts, which are set to expire next year, with Wells Fargo and with Bank One for its Star Systems automated teller machine and debit-card network. First Data emerged the front-runner for Concord EFS after outbidding Automatic Data Processing Inc., a big issuer of paychecks, last week, the executives said. A spokeswoman for First Data said, ``We don't speculate on market rumors.'' A spokesman for Concord EFS coul&amp; not be reached. Competition for card transactions has been fierce as Concord, First Data and Visa USA, which operates a network for debit cards called Interlink, have all lowered the fees they charge to banks and stores to process customer purchases in an effort to gain market share. Shares of Concord EFS have been hit hard by the concern about its future and whether it could lose business to Visa's Interlink network. Shares of Concord EFS fell 28 cents, to $9.40 Monday. The stock has fallen from a 52-week high of $35.06. Shares of First Data rose 29 cents, to $37.01. Concord EFS restated its earnings last week, adjusting the way it accounted for its interchange fee for debit card transactions, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested an accounting change. The change resulted in a reduction in revenue offset by a reduction in cost of operations, and, therefore, had no effect on reported operating income, net income or cash flows for any annual or quarterly period. But the accounting change did raise overall margins.&lt; &lt; &lt;
