A recent change in federal airspace rules restricts banner-towing planes like his from flying near open-air venues with at least 30,000 seats an hour before and after an event. Williams, 35, made $12,000 towing banners over Minute Maid Park and the Ballpark at Arlington on Major League Baseball's opening day last year. Standing in a hangar on a country road in Brazoria County, surrounded by plane parts and 7-foot-tall letters made of red sailcloth, he said he doesn't expect to make anything off the Astros' opening day today. ``My rush-hour business pays the bills, but to make money I need events,'' said Williams, a native Houstonian and one of a handful of aerial advertisers in Texas. Slipped into a 4,200-page congressional spending bill, the restrictive flight rule was passed for national security reasons related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Sports leagues, universities and others lobbied Congress for the change, which keeps the lightweight, fabric-covered planes at least 3,000 feet in the air and 3.45 miles from large venues. A banner-towing plane weighs about the same as a couple of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Aerial advertisers are up in arms because they go through FBI background checks before they may tow banners, and the Federal Aviation Administration waiver system they have flown under since 9/11 requires them to file information on their planes and where they plan to fly them. Pilots say it's crippling their business and putting public airspace into the hands of greedy sports teams and colleges that don't want anyone else making revenue off their events. A Houston Texans spokeswoman referred all calls to Reliant Park officials. ``We favor anything that makes the facility more secure, and apparently that was the intent of the legislation,'' said Nina Jackson, Reliant Park spokeswoman. Rob Matwick, Astros senior vice president of operations, doesn't have a strong opinion about banner-towing planes. He doesn't consider the aerial advertisers a nuisance, but he supports the new no-fly provision, which will be in effect for at least a year. The rule allows regular commercial flights, approved by air traffic controllers, to operate inside the no-fly zones, as well as blimps and flights for official broadcast purposes, and planes carrying team officials and players and their immediate family members and guests. Pilots aren't the onlyth the rule. ``It's an overreaction,'' said Carl Reister, 62, of Pasadena. ``The terrorists are winning. How many things in our lives have changed since 9/11?'' Banner-towing planes are ``part of Americana,'' Reister said. Nowadays, thrsonal messages of the ``Marry Me, Margaret'' variety. `ThD U.S. Aerial Advertisers Association says there are more than 200 banner-towing companies nationwide with more than a thousand aircraft. It's a $250-million-a-year industry, Williams said. Last year, he made $640,000 a month, the lion's share of which came from advertising generated by sports games. ``I'm doing about $30,000 a month now,'' he said. Williams said aerial advertisers were grounded for four months after 9/11. Before the attacks, he had 20 employees. Now he has eight pilots and mechanics. ``After this, who knows; maybe they'll just be three,'' he said. XXX END OF STORY $$$
