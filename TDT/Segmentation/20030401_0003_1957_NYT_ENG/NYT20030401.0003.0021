Town Hall in this hamlet of 3,400 is a Victorian brick building with bow windows which houses a public library open only 15 hours a week and a part-time clerk who keeps jelly beans for the selectmen. Even if a sign over the door didn't identify it as municipal headquarters, its location would keep a passerby from mistaking it for someone's grand old house. The triangle where it sits has monuments to Cheshire residents who fought, and sometimes died, in the nation's wars. The stone honor roll of those who served in World War I notes just one, Thomas E. Courtney, who died in battle. A larger monument lists the 339 Cheshire residents who fought in wars from World War II to Desert Storm, and the asterisk beside a few _ seven in World War II, including brothers Andries and Daniel Curtin; two in Korea; two in Vietnam _ memorializes those killed in action. Yet a wreath of artificial carnations in red, white, and blue, on a stand between the scrolls, has no name attached. Everyone here knows it is for Sergeant Daniel H. Petithory, the young US Army Special Forces soldier killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan on Dec. 5, 2001. Now comes another war. With the memory of Petithory's loss still fresh, people in this quiet Berkshires town are divided over the wisdom of the current conflict in the Persian Gulf. This is a community where residents tend to work in sales or manufacturing or construction or the service sector, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than two to one, but there are more unenrolled voters than members of either party combined. Vociferous protest and rampant flag-waving are the stuff of other places, but war is on the mind here, too. The town clerk's office, busy one morning with license renewals for Cheshire's 700 dogs, attracts a stream of pet owners who are skeptical about the war. ``Everybody is behind all the young people over there,'' says Town Clerk Christine Emerson, 55. ``We just don't think they should be there.'' Ask whether this war feels different from the one that claimed Petithory at the age of 32, and opinion diverges. ``When that happened, we were responding to a direct attack,'' says David Phelps, 53, a bookmobile driver here to register a mixed breed named Fuzzy. ``I still don't see the connection between Saddam and 9/11. They're trying to make that case, but they haven't made it with me.'' Emerson disagrees. ``I didn't like Afgxanisrn wood floor, whirring ceiling fans, and kerosene pump evoke a bygone era when a general store didn't have to specialize in power equipment to stay in business. The talk between two World War II veterans decidedly favors disarming Saddam Hussein by force. ``Oh, I'm all for it,'' says customer Albert LaVigne, 77, a retired applications engineer for General Electric. ``That whole regime should come down. I do believe he's loaded with weapons of mass destruction.'' ``It had to be done,'' says Stanley Reynolds, 76, whose family has owned the store since 1937. ``The UN has to be a pretty soft organization. It doesn't have the courage to stand up.'' In a state where almost one-fifth of the population is minority, Cheshire is overwhelmingly homogenous _ 98 percent of its residents are white. Half the population is over 40, a good four years older than the state's median age and almost a decade older than Boston's. Massachusetts may boast a well-educated workforce and a number of prestigious universities, but here only 20 percent of residents over the age of 25 have graduated from college. Cheshire sent Danny Petithory, known years ago for his prowess playing hide-and-seek, from Hoosac Valley Regional High School straight to the Army. Nestled between Pittsfield and Adams, Cheshire is big enough for one traffic light but too small for a town green. As the hills that surround it blush pink in anticipation of spring, a long winter terbkes on a still-frozen Hoosac Lake where two hardy men venture out on a mild March morning. The houses here are modest ranches or simple frame homes, with a trailer per{"at one end of town and a small subdivision of spacious new homes at another. The Appalachian Trail runs through Cheshire, and so does a new bicycle path, the Ashuwillticook Rail Trail. Last fall a portion of it was dedicated to Petithory, and in a resting spot with two benchesba plaque says he ``made the ultimate sacrifice for his nation'' in Kandahar. Scattered around town are American flags _ on houses, on car antennae, in jars on the front counter at HD Reynolds. On Emerson's table in the town clerk's office is a basket of pins with red, white, and blue ribbons that she's remembered to put out most days since Sept. 11, 2001. The Country Charm restaurant is displaying yellow ribbons. Petithory's parents declined to speak to a reporter, but from their porch they fly a US flag and a purple banner emblazoned with a cross and a dove. Petithory was the first Cheshire soldier to be killed in action since Vietnam, and his death brings war home to a new generation. Keith Bona, a 34-year-old printer in North Adams who didn't even know Petithory, sold teddy bears with green berets and netted $20,000 for a scholarship in the slain sergeant's memory. Theminimart at O'Connell's Shell station here in Cheshire sold 1,500. Bruce Bissaillon met Petithory in kindergarten, and last year he helped organize a golf tournament in memory of his close friend. He's a waiter at Lakeside Restaurant, where a hamburger goes for $2, and he mentions Petithory in the breath after pledging support for the Iraq war. ``I'm for it. He's had 12 years to disarm. It's time,'' says Bissaillon, 34. ``My friend died in Afghanistan.'' In Town Hall, Kathy Bedard, 57, a retired accountant getting licenses for her three German shepherds, invokes Petithory's memory from a different point of view. ``It was the first thing I thought of when I saw the POWs on TV. I don't think the Petithorys will ever recover,'' she says. ``I think that's why we're so against it. The pain is real. You can relate to the parents.'' Now a new war places burdens on other shoulders. Stephen La Fogg, a concrete foreman and an Army reservist, lives down the streetow. His 14-year-old son has taken over fixing the sump pump and installing a faucet. ``I feel sad doz!everyone,'' says La Fogg's wife, Lu Ann, also 47. ``I have to support my husband 100 percent, and I do support the president 100 percent. I am nervous. I don't know how to explain it. I'm pretty sure he's going to be safe, but there's always that feeling.'' In the garage at the sprawling Bedard Bros. auto dealership overlooking Hoosac Lake, Michael Hosier works on a pickup truck's clutch fan. His son Michael Jr., 21, is a Marine fighting in Iraq, which has Hosier looking at the war through a very personal prism. ``As long as he's OK, it's a great thing,'' Hosier says. ``If he's hurt, it's not so good. I believe the guy (Hussein) shouldn't be in power, but I think it's not all up to us.'' Bedard, with 55 workers, is the town's largest employer. Banners for Volvo, Dodge, and Honda flutter in the wind beside flags of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Opinion at Bedard is mixed. ``I'm a veteran myself, so I'm very supportive of it,'' says Sean Bailey, a 37-year-old salesman who was in the Air Force just prior to the first Gulf War. ``I hope it turns out to be the reason we went over there. The weapons of mass destruction.'' Fellow salesman Richard McCarthy, 57, is a veteran, too. He served in Vietnam. ``No one who has seen war is in favor of war,'' he says. ``I don't believe the evidence they produced was enough to justify the loss of life on both sides. I'm not going to get on a soapbox and suggest everyone should think like I do. I'll do it through the ballot box.'' Their boss, Brian Bedard, 47, brother-in-law of Kathy Bedard, hesitates, too. ``I think it's just a situation where even if we're totally successful it isn't going to resolve the situation,'' he says. ``I don't agree with any protests at this point. Prior to, it's fine, but once the process is started you have to throw your support to the troops.'' One of the smallest businesses in town is T's Treats, open since January in a modest red box of a building up the road from the bike path and the Appalachian Trail. While her 4-year-old son Tyler plays with a truck at her feet, proprieter Tina Lancia, 33, embroiders canvas bags for Easter. She sells homemade cookies, pretzels, and eclairs. ``I guess I'm on both sides,'' she says. ``I strongly feel something should have been done. But, at the same time, did we have to go to war, you know?'' In the post office next door, attorney Edmund St. Jnhj, 52, picks up his mail and remembers protesting against the Vietnam War. He questions this war, too, but he looks back with regret at the tone of the antiwar movement of three decades ago. ``The mistake a lot of us made at that time is that we didn't support our troops,'' he says. ``What I find distressing is the way we treated those guys when they came back. I wouldn't want to see that happen to those guys who are over there now.'' St. John says hello to an older woman leaWing the post office. ``She lost a son in Vietnam,'' he murmurs after the door swings closed behind her. The town cemetery is the final resting place of Howard Luscier and Chester Witanek, the two sons of Cheshire who died in Vietnam. Civil War veterans, who came home gravely ill with dysentery, are buried here, too, So is Daniel Petithory. At the base of his pink marble tombstone, mourners have placed three Heineken beer-bottle caps, a Ziploc bag with a Green Beret teddy bear and a T-shirt from the Daniel Petithory olG Tournament, and four tiny plastic soldiers. Three are crouched, aiming rifles at an invisible foe. The other one has fallen.
