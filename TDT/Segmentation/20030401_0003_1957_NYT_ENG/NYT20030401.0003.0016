Five years ago, Cagle's latest would have made him a hit-making machine on new country radio. He's a Music Row dream, writing blue-collar country songs like Clint Black, singing them with the rugged voice of Tim McGraw and the emotional intuition of Faith Hill. Today, however, new country seems to sell best with a gimmick, such as the cowboy-meets-surfer persona of Kenny Chesney or the angry-American rants of Toby Keith. With the follow-up to his gold-selling debut, ``Play It Loud,'' Cagle will find out whether his old new country still sells. The first single, ``What a Beautiful Day,'' should help pave the way. A simple fiddle-guitar melody is the blueprint for this love story, the first of many that dot the collection. Cagle's midrange twang lends itself to the style. Dressed up with a pop-piano opening and backing hums on the chorus, the arrangement leaves the country swing of George Strait behind and enters McGraw-style flash. It's a different approach for Cagle, who prides himself on being a hardscrabble cowboy with a lunchbox work ethic. That's about to change for good. With lyrics like ``Day 1, I stumbled through hello on Fifth Avenue. ... She said, `I Do' on Day 482, and gave me a son on Day 761,'' cowboys ant #gwgirls heading for the altar will be adding this to their wedding reception playlists en masse. Cagle mixes adult love songs (``I Love It When She Does That,'' ``Growin' Love'') and love-gone-wrong songs (``I'd Be Lying,'' ``Look at What I've Done'') with a smattering of rev-ups. He seems to like driving honky-tonk when he's flirting and tender slow dances when he's romancing for keeps. Both styles usually include range-reaching choruses accompanied by fiddles, mandolins and guitars. The album would have benefited, however, if listeners heard more about the chase than the relationship that's dominating Cagle's thoughts. The stompin' whirl of ``Chicks Dig It,'' with its stories of impressing girls by acting like an idiot, is a highlight guys can relate to. The same goes for the dueling mandolin and mandocello describing the more physical ``Everything.'' ``Cagle'' is catchy country, and might've been a multiplatinum winner in 1997. Today it might not be enough of an original twist on a highly profitable new country theme. Grade: C+ @XXX END OF STORY^ @ $$$
