ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS MAY BURN HOLES IN BUSH'S `ROAD MAP'@ ATTENTION EDITORS: This article from the NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE report of MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2003, is available as a `separate buy.' For inforoation acoutded(at)nytimes.com@ Optional trim to 900 words@ By REBECCA GOLDSMITH@ c.2003 Newhouse News Service@ SHILO, West Bank _ The so-called Middle East ``road map'' promised by President Bush is essentially a plan to create a Palestinian state by 2005 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where some 200,000 Jewish settlers live despite U.N. resolutions designating the areas a Palestinian homeland. West Bank and Gaza also are home to about 2 million Palestinians. The difficulty of divvying up the West Bank is just one of the seemingly intractable obstacles to peace that help explain why many Israelis and Palestinians say they feel hopeless about the future. ``There is an expectation that some people have that, miraculously, after the United States deals with Iraq, there's going to be a new Middle East; (they) ... are hoping for something that will extricate the Israelis and Palestinians from their political situation,'' said Asher Susser, director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Tel Aviv University. But, Susser said, ``The kinds of issues that separate Israelis and Palestinians are still going to be there even when the United States finishes (in Iraq). They won't be any easier to resolve.'' Doubts about a resolution afflict even some of the conservatives who subscribe to the ``domino theory'' that sees regime change in Iraq eradicating terrorism and spreading democracy throughout Arab states. Yuri Shtern, a member of Israel's parliament and chairman of the conservative National Union-Israel Beitenu faction within it, said the establishment of a Palestinian state of any kind would negate any gains from ousting Saddam Hussein in Iraq. ``The Palestinian state would only be the state of terror,'' Shtern said. Instead, he called for ``resettlement'' of Palestinians living in refugee camps to better living conditions in Arab-run countries. He said funding for his plan ``should be an international problem,'' not Israel's. While Israelis battle it out among themselves, Palestinian leaders are pushing for a speedy publication of the road map plan. Bush had promised to present his plan when Palestinians appointed a prime minister. Mahmoud Abbas has been named to the post, but Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has said Israel won't be ready to open negotiations with the Palestinians until Abbas shows he has control on the ground and prevents terror activities. ``I don't think that we have to wait for the war to end to begin a peace process,'' said Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestinians. ``The road map should have been introduced a long time ago, and any day we delay, I think, is a mistake.'' Meanwhile, Israelis in settlements like Shilo _ a West Bank community of 200 families surrounded by Arab villages, some 180 miles north of Jerusalem _ are digging in their heels. ``We're not going anywhere; this is our home,'' said Sara Katz, a 44-year-old mother of eight and the wife of Shilo's mayor, Chaim. Tenacity is a way of life here. Shilo began as an outpost 25 years ago with a few temporary structures, no paved roads and no running water. Now it has its own schools and a perimeter patrolled by gunmen around the clock. Lisa and David Rubin, who came here from the United States, live with their six children behind a white picket fence. A barbecue is in the back yard. The five older children run freely through their neighborhood. But their lives are far from carefree. In December 2001, David Rubin, 46, and son Ruby, then 3, were shot while David was driving near another settlement in the area. Lisa Rubin, 39, calls their recoveries a miracle, considering the boy was shot in the neck. Several of the children still refut is leave, get out,'' Lisa Rubin said last week. But instinct isn't the main motivation for Rubin and most of her neighbors. ``All we want to do is hold on to what belongs to us,'' she said. ``I still drive in a car. I'm not going to let our enemy keep us from living day to day, going where I need to go.'' Most Jewish settlers, like the majority of Jews in Israel, support the U.S. war in Iraq. But many settlers fear Israel will suffer from Bush's efforts to promote the ``road map'' as political payback to British Prime Minister Tony Blair for his support on Iraq. ``It's obvious why President Bush will owe an incredible debt to Tony Blair,'' said Dina Shalit, deputy mayor in the town of Ariel, one of the largest Jewish communities in the West Bank. (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)@ Founded at the same time as Shilo, Ariel is held out as a shining example of success for the settlement movement. As a political and religious statement, the settlement movement gained momentum after the Six Day War of 1967, when Israel seized all of the previously divided Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank. Ariel, which in the 1990s roughly doubled in population, is located in the middle of the West Bank. It is a strategy for claiming land that settlers call ``creating facts on the ground.'' To Palestinians, it is blatant land-grabbing. Civic leaders take pride in Ariel's explosive growth. A small city of 18,000 people, it includes a 7,000-student university, a 100-room hotel and a downtown shopping area. The first high-rise in a West Bank Jewish community, an eight-story residential building, is under construction. Half the town's residents are Russians who immigrated in the 1990s. Growth has been helped by donations from wealthy Americans, including Christian groups whose prophetic missions align them with Jewish settlers. Ariel's numbers made the town ``irreversible'' about 10 years ago, Shalit said, meaning its residents could not be relocated. Most discussions of a peace plan include Ariel as part of Israel. Indeed, planners of an Israeli ``security fence'' under construction along the length of the West Bank proposed last week to have it make a detour around Ariel. Many settlers oppose the fence, saying it will create borders where there should be none. In other words, drawing a line around Ariel could make it easier to isolate and dismantle communities like Shilo that are more remote from Israel proper. ``We view this whole fence thing as a big mistake,'' Shalit said. ``Once you do it, it's a fait accompli.'' (OPTIONAL TRI EoDS)@ Eitan Turgeman, 39, a father of three who owns Ariel's beauty salon, said he is skeptical of any plan to create a Palestinian state near Israel. ``I don't mind that they have a state, but not close to me,'' Turgeman said, suggesting Egypt or Jordan would be better. ``I don't know if we can get along with them. As much as we give, it's not Enoegh. Whatever you give them, six fingers, 10 fingers, they're never satisfied.''
