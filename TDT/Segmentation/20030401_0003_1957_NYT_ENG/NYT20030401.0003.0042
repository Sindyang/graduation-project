Agnes Warner has seen three centuries, two Halley's comets _ actually, the same one twice _ and eight great-grandchildren. She led an all-women's band in Florida in the 1960s, when she answered to the name Toots. She played cornet and a wicked hand of bridge. But things have been a little quiet for the past 30 years for Warner, who dresses meticulously and has hair as white, fine and elegantly shaped as spun sugar. Her husband died in 1969, her band members followed and her back and short-term memory are causing her problems. So when Edie Barr, the recreation director of the Chelsea at East Brunswick, the assisted living facility where Warner now lives, asked what she wanted for her 105th birthday on March 27, her answer was at the ready: a date. ``She said she didn't want to get married, but she wouldn't mind a boyfriend,'' said Barr, who arranged for an article in The Home News Tribune, a local newspaper, about Warner, announcing that ``great-grandfathers are sought to vie for the opportunity to be her date for the evening.'' Last Thursday, on her birthday, four mature muffins sat in a row in the Chelsea's lobby, all clean-shaven, with red roses in their lapels, two with canes, and one wearing a herringbone jacket, plaid shirt and colorful knit vest. Decked out in big pearl clip-on earrings and a wrist corsage, Warner danced with each in order. There was Contestant No. 1, Michael V. Gonzalez, 94, who led her waltzing as ``Somewhere My Love'' was played on the baby grand piano. Bachelor No. 2 was George Zupeck, 88, who retired 26 years ago from Squibb and urged Warner, ``Come on, get close,'' as he led her around the floor to ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'' He had called the Chelsea after seeing the newspaper article, and his references were checked at the Elks lodge. ``They said, `He's a beautiful dancer, take him,' and they did,'' he said. And he was. Tom Fargin, 85, a former longshoremen's union representative in a gray suit and red tie, danced with Warner to ``Moon River.'' And from the Chelsea, there was Carl Mendola, 85, who waltzed with Warner to ``Edelweiss.'' (She prefers the fox trot, her son, Russ Warner, who is 75, said later.) Between numbers, she rested in a wing chair decorated with roses and carnations, and Barr interviewed the men about how many great-grandchildren they have and their views on older women. After the dancing, Warner pushed her walker over to the piano and began playing for the crowd, as she often does during cocktail hour, which starts at 3:30 p.m. Though she complained that she did not remember the songs, she persevered, and the notes coalesced, haltingly, into melodies, her hands meeting in music familiar from the early part of the last century. She played ``Give My Regards to Broadway'' and ``The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze.'' Zupeck asked canarylike vibrato as she played. After several songs, Barr reminded Warner that it was time to choose a bachelor. When Warner said, ``Oh, please don't ask me that, they were all very good,'' Barr resorted to an informal applause meter. Mendola, the home-team favorite, won hands down. Zupeck congratulated him. Warner fiddled with the buttons on her white cardigan. She played another old favorite on the piano, and the audience of about 40 residents caught up with her, singing ``You're a Grand Old Flag.'' Mendola was clearly pleased that he had carried the day. ``She's a wonderful woman, a very nice woman,'' he said. ``We speak well together, as if we'd known each other a long time.'' ``You are the winner, kid,'' Gonzalez told him. ``Thanks, Michael. You're No. 1.''- 0 Karen Popick, Mendola's granddaughter, said he had been excited by the dating game. ``He got a specific outfit picked out,'' she said. ``It was adorable. He got his hair cut.'' Mendola called her ``my No. 1 granddaughter.'' He referred to Warner as ``my lady friend.'' Followed by relatives with video and still cameras, the couple proceeded to the private dining room, which featured six gold candles in a candelabra. ``Carl, you're going to have to carry the conversation,'' Barr said to him, as the couple approached the table. ``Sure,'' Mendola said. To Warner, he added, ``You're a lovely lady.'' ``I have a bad back,'' she said. ``Sit back,'' he suggested. ``I'm getting old, you know,'' she said. ``Never say you're getting old,'' he said. The choice of pork chops or scampi did not quite suit the birthday girl. ``Don't you have anything I like?'' Warner asked the waitress. When her son tried to order her a sandwich, she revolted. ``Cream cheese and jelly?'' Warner said. ``Oh God, I have that every day of my life.'' They decided on chicken for her, with milk and a salad. When her glass arrived she raised it and said, ``Here's good luck to you, sir.'' Mendola was busy with his pork chops and did not hear. He wore his room key on a yellow phone-cord bracelet, and it clicked on the plate. They ate in silence. ``You don't talk much at the table, is that your way?'' she said. ``Not that it matters. You got a wife?'' ``She passed away in 1987,'' he said. ``That's OK,'' she said. ``For this, I've been a widow for a long time.'' Before dessert, the couple were left to their own devices. Whatever their conversation, they kept it to themselves. Warner's son reported, after discreet questioning, that a good-night kiss had not occurred between his mother and her date. &lt;
