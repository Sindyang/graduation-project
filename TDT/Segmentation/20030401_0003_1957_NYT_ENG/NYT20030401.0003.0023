STUDENTS LEARNING JAPANESE SEE BRIGHT JOB MARKET AHEAD@&lt; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)@&lt; \Bq!HECTOR SALDANA@= c.2003 San Antonio Express-News@= SAN ANTONIO _ They start each day with a respectful bow and a cheerful, ``Ohay gozaimasu.'' That ``good morning'' is directed at teacher Rieko O'Donnell, whose day has started that way with her Japanese language students at Tafolla Middle School for the past eight years. At the school, the daily morning ritual signals ``respect, and that we're ready to learn,'' O'Donnell said. ``Just like Japanese students.'' With`thD recent announcement that Toyota Motor Corp. is locating south$ov"San Antonio, her p2edNminantly Hispanic students realize they have made a smart choice for their future. Many of the students in the three-year program already are thinking !boTt jobs at Toyota, which announced Feb. 5 that it would build Tundra pickup truck assembly plant in this South Texas city of more than 1 million people. The factory is expected to provide about 2,000 high-wage jobs, about 80 percent of which will be labor-)ntDnsive assembly line positions. Initial payroll for the plant, scheduled to open in 2006, will be $100 million. Celeste Guzman said her grandmother wanted her to learn French. ``But she$txknks this is better with Toyota coming,'' says the 12-year-old. Students from 40 San Antonio School District schools are bused to Tafolla for intensive classes in Spanish, Russian, Japanese, French and German. Children apply for admission while in the fifth grade. Only about 125 slots are available each year. Once accepted, students must maintain a 75 grade-point average. Japanese now ranks third behind Spanish and Russian in popularity at Tafolla. Lately, required essays for admission to the multilingual program mention the auto manufacturer more and more. O'Donnell's third-floor classroom is decorated with maps, calendars and pictures of her homeland. Overhead hang Japanese lanterns called chouchin. Colorful carp streamers called koinobori decorate the walls. The teacher stages Japanese plays, some based on historical events more than 600 years ago, to help children understand the language and culture. Her students must memorize lines and act out the parts. ``We are very proud people,'' O'Donnell explains. She urges her students to ``always be polite, because you are representing Tafolla's Japanese class _ the best in Texas.'' Her class is conducted 100 percent in Japanese _ reading, writing, comprehension, translation and cultural study. Students maintain a weekly journal in traditional hiragana handwriting. O'Donnell acknowledges that her middle school students are learning high school- and college-level Japanese. ``Some kids can't make it,'' she says. ``It's a vigorous program.'' But dreams are born here more often than not. ``At first, it started because I wanted to read Pokemon cards,'' said Joshua Mariscao, a student. ``The goal now is to go to Japan and open a business there.'' The students see themselves breaking down old prejudices. Stereotypes give way to understanding. It's not a major leap, says the teacher, ``because Hispanic culture is very family-oriented, and so are we.''
