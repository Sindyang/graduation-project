The Italian police have arrested four men in the northern cities of Milan and Parma on suspicion of having links to international terrorism and possession of false documents, a police spokeswoman said on Tuesday. The suspects, two Kurdish men, an Egyptian and a Somalian, were taken into custody late Monday by the Italian antiterrorism police, the spokeswoman, Alessandra Simone, said. According to the police, the four are Islamic radicals connected to both al-Qaida and the Ansar al-Islam terror group, which the United States has accused of manufacturing poisons in chemical weapons plants in northern Iraq and of aiding al-Qaida in the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Ansar's founder has denied ties between the two groups. Ansar was ousted from its territory in northeastern Iraq last weekend. The assault, a combination of U.S. airstrikes and a ground attack led by Special Forces coordinating with indigenous Kurdish fighters, resulted in the capture of several villages held by Ansar and the group's offices, bunkers, barracks and camps. The destruction and capture of the militant camps ``is a setback for the terrorist infrastructure,'' the prime minister of the eastern Kurdish zone, Dr. Barham Salih, said. But he warned, ``That does not mean the end of the terrorist problem.'' The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, recently told CNN in a recent interview that ``it's from this site where people were trained and where poisons were developed that migrated into Europe.'' The Italian police said the arrests were the fruit of a long investigation, one that Italian media reports said included intercepted satellite phone conversations between the suspected cell members and villages in Iraq. According to Corriere della Sera, One of Italy's major newspapers, those conversations suggested the plotting of terror activity. ``We're ready, the thing is big,'' one of the suspected terrorist cell members was recorded as saying, according to the newspaper, which also reported that the police decided to arrest the men after learning that they were planning to leave the country for nrecruiting Iraqi and Kurdish volunteers to fight U.S. and British coalition forces in Iraq. But the police confirmed only that the two Kurds were charged with promoting clandestine immigration. They are suspected of helping other Kurds sneak into into European countries through Italy.
