Nets' hit men take down Rockets (For use by New York Times News Service clients)&lt; By JONATHAN FEIGEN^&lt; @c. 2003, Houston Chronicle= EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The rest of the Rockets had already collapsed. They were crawling around bloody and groggy, showing only passing interest in the whole affair. With the season and last chances to earn a playoff spot slipping away, the Rockets ran headlong and full speed into the veteran wall Monday night. They did not get up. The rookie, however, was fine. But to make sure Ya/ MHng left feeling just as defeated as his quick-to-surrender teammates, Nets center Dikembe Mutombo delivered a hard elbow to Yao's throat to make sure the pain of a 110-86 loss was shared. There was plenty of pain to go around. Steve Francis blamed the Rockets' disinterested defense on disinterested teammates. Eddie Griffin blamed it on a carry-over from a selfish offense. James Posey said the defensive breakdown began with frustration in a misfiring offense. But whatever the cause, even the sight of Mutombo popping Yao in the throat failed to rev the Rockets' engines. ``It was a lackluster performance on our part,'' Rockets acting head coach Larry Smith said. ``I thought we were ready for these guys. Tonight everything was pretty much easy for them.'' The Nets' only problem was stopping Yao. He had thoroughly reversed his recent shooting struggles and was 14 points into his 18-point first half when Mutombo laid him out 70 seconds before halftime. But with that one swing, Mutombo showed more interest in defense than the Rockets would the entire night. ``The center I went up against today gave me a very deep impression,'' Yao s1447:27:477066&lt; speaking in puns in two languages. ``I think his face is a little bit cuter than his elbow. Even if it was intentional, it happened. He was penalized for it. I got my two shots.'' Yao finished with 24 points, making eight of 11 shots. He spun swiftly away from double teams and even flashed one rim-swinging slam. ``In a couple of years,'' Nets forward Richard Jefferson said, ``he's going to be the best player in the game.'' But the bulk of Rockets veterans, theoretically gearing up for a finishing kick through the end of the season, were, as the 20,049 locals in Continental Airlines Arena might say, ``a dud, all stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey.'' ``It seemed like guys were running in quicksand tonight,'' said Francis, who had 22 points, six rebounds and five assists. ``The only thing I was a little upset about was the way they did it celebrating. We thumped them at our home. We didn't do all that celebrating or running plays with a minute left. That's something right there that will stick in the back of my head the next time we play the New Jersey Nets.'' But Francis' frustration was not focused solely on the Nets' happiness, Mutombo's elbow, the flagrant-1 foul called on Kelvin Cato or fallaid. ``I don't think 11 out of the 11 guys that suited up (Cuttino Mobley was sidelined with a sprained left index finger) were prepared to play tonight. ``It's not on our coach at all. If a player wants to make a scapegoat out of the coach, they're just trying to look out for themselves. It's not the coach one bit. Players know who they are who weren't putting everything into it. If we don't get that solved, we'll sing the same sad song in three weeks.'' However, the Rockets didn't have to wait for the end of the regular season to return to a familiar refrain. ``We didn't play team basketball,'' said Griffin, who made two of nine shots in scoring seven points. ``That's why we lost by so much. We weren't playing team basketball and trusting each other. Guys got frustrated and didn't play good defense. ``I don't think it was anything they did. I think we shot ourselves out of the game by trying to do too much one-on-one basketball and not trusting each other.'' Whatever the cause of the problem, it was most obvious on the defensive end, where the Rockets were repeatedly outrun by the Nets (Rockets coaches had New Jersey with 34 fast-break points), who could easily curl around screens for the most open of shots. With Kenyon Martin out with a sprained right knee, Jefferson toyed with t*e Rockets' frontcourt. Acquired with one of the first-round picks the Rockets sent New Jersey for Griffin, Jefferson hadb30 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. Jason Kidd _ left so open he uncharacteristically took 23 shots, making 12 _ added 30 points and 12 rebounds as the Nets pushed their lead to 30. Mutombo, in his second game since coming off the injured list, had"fgtr points, eight rebounds and one knockdown in 16 minutes. Asked if it is possible to hit a 7-5 center in the throat by accident, Cato said, ``Hell no,'' and then walked away. ``The guy is 7-6,'' Mutombo said. ``He's almost three inches taller than me. I can't believe my elbow reached his neck. I thought maybe I would just get it between his chest and stomach, and I would box him out. The next thing I know, he's on the floor. ``I told him, `Get up.' '' Yao did. The bulk of the Rockets, however, meekly took whatever the Nets delivered. $$$
