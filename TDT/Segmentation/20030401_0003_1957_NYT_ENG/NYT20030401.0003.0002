Bob Knight's Red Raiders, Connecticut, Georgia Tech and Utah will headline a field of 16 tea-s Hn the NIT Preseason tournament. Folaying. They'll remember this trip. For many of the players, it will be their first trip to New York City and maybe their only chance to play inside legendary Madison Square Garden. They'll also remember that they never want to play there again in April. ``Yeah, I'd rather go to the NCAA,'' Tech senior`KaRib Powell said as the team left for the Big Apple. ``But, we're giving it 110 percent.'' What all four semifinalists have in common are dashed hopes and a season that fell below expectations. Yet all four have managed to subdue their disappointment to compete for a consolation championship. Tech (21-12) enters its semifinal game against St. John's (19-13) as a one-point favorite. Minnesota (18i1" , which Tech beat earlier this season, plays Georgetown (18-14) in the other semifinal. The final is at 7 p.m. Thursday. ``If you kept track of the teams the No. 1- and 2-seeded teams \Rin the NCAA Tournament\S play in the first two rounds, you'll find that very few of them, if any, would be as good as maybe 20 teams in the NIT,'' said Knight, who makes his first trip to New York for the NIT semifinals since 1985. ``That's what makes the NIT so worthwhile because there's a lot of good competition in it.'' There is something to be said for that. The Big East complained that only four of its teams made it to the NCAA Tournament. Syracuse is in the Final Four and Georgetown and St. John's have rolled through three victories each in the NIT. Texas Tech, while playing itself onto the NCAA bubble, still received some support for an NCAA bid because of the competitiveness of the Big 12O Conference, which has two teams in the NCAA Final Four. And Tech beat one of them, Texas, in the Big 12 tournament. ``What we benefit mostly from \Rby playing in the NIT\S,'' Knight said, ``is that when we play as best as we can, we know that we are one hard to team to play against.'' Still, returning players such as Andre Emmett will remember defeating Texas and playing Oklahoma tough a lot more than winning an NIT championship. Tech has faced lighter competition than it does most nights in its own conference. Nevada and San Diego State are teams Tech would schedule for a decent nonconference game. They played at San Diego State and won this season. Tech is the favorite to win the NIT. It enters the semifinals with an Ratings Percentage Index of 48, the best of the final four teams. The RPI ranks teams through a combination of statistics such as home and road records, quality victories and strength of schedule. It is one tool the NCAA Tournament selection committee uses to decide its field of 65. St. John's RPI is 78. Minnesota is 71 and Georgetown is 100. Any of the four would likely have a more difficult time winning the NIT preseason tournament than this one. But, Knight said, that's not really the point. ``The NIT,'' Knight said, ``is a great alternative to continue to work at things.'' Each of Knight's three Indiana teams that played in the NIT returned to the NCAA Tournament the next season. nn
