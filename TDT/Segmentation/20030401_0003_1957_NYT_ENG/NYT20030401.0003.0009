TIPS FOR TEENS(a)&lt; (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)&lt; By DAWN GILBERTSON(a)= c.2003 The Arizona Republic(a)= (PHOENIX) - Students searching for a summer job will find stiff competition this year because of the weak economy. Here are suggestions, from Communities in Schools in Arizona, on how to approach the hunt. Tell everybody you know or meet you're looking for a job. They might have a lead or a position. Put together a folder highlighting your accomplishments, from awards to volunteer activities, and any skills specific to the job. The effort will show the employer you're serious. Visit three businesses in your neighborhood and ask about any opportunities. Nag, nag, nag. After you fill out an application or have an interview, be persistent about following up. Communities in Schools of Arizona has scheduled workshops for teens from 5 to 7 p.m. Wednesday and April 23 at Desert Sage Library, 7602 W. Encanto Blvd. The group also is organizing three teen job fairs this spring. Details: (602) 252-5312.
