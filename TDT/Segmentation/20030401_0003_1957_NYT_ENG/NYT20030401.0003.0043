Works of art and architecture have always been among the victims of war. Here are a few significant examples: _ In 1687, the Turks' Ottoman Empire and the Venetians were at war, with the Acropolis under siege. The Turks were using the Parthenon, the renowned temple of Athena on the Acropolis, for weapons storage when a Venetian projectile struck the center of the building, causing massive damage. _ In 1860, while Beijing was occupied by British and French troops, Britain's Lord Elgin undertook the burning of the Summer Palace, a collection of beautiful historic buildings outside of the city's center. _ The exquisite Monte Cassino monastery in Italy was destroyed and rebuilt on four occasions, the last destruction occurring during World War II when it was caught in cross fire and reduced to rubble in a matter of hours. It has since been rebuilt. _ Between April and October 1941, German air raids targeted historically significant English cities such as Bath, with its Roman ruins, and Canterbury. Canterbury's St. George Church, where Christopher Marlowe was baptized, was one of many buildings destroyed in these raids. The air attacks were dubbed the Baedeker Raids, after a popular tourism guidebook to Britain. _ Caravaggio's precedent-setting ``St. Matthew and the Angel'' was a major fixture of Berlin's Kaiser-Friedrich Museum. It was destroyed near the end of World War II. _ Gustave Courbet's grand and radically realistic work ``The Stonebreakers'' had been housed in Dresden's Gemaldegalerie. It was also destroyed near the end of World War II. _ Leonardo da Vinci's ``The Last Supper'' was nearly a victim of World War II as well. Leonardo had painted the mural on a wall of the refectory of the church of Santa Maria delld Crazie in Milan. The wall was protected by sandbags, and when the refectory was bombed, the wall upon which ``The Last Supper'' was painted was the only portion of the building left standing. _ Sarajevo's most important mosque, the 16th-century Gazi Husrev-Beg, was struck by more than 80 shells during the war in Bosnia in the early 1990s. _ In 2001, Taliban forces destroyed two on.
