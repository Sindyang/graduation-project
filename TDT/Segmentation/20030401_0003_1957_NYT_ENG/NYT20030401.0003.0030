Global-positioning technology and satellita smmmunications used so effectively to target enemy tanks, bla3t Lilitary bases and keep units in sync won't help troops in street battles. In close quarters, these signals may fail, and air and artillery support may be unusable. Most front-line soldiers carry some form of a hand-held global-positioning device to help them radio in targeting positions and execute missions. Troops may also be carrying several kinds of radios, including short-range devices that let individuals in one unit talk with those in another during close combat, said Army Capt. Michael Wise, who was a signal commander in Bosnia. Another device may allow communication as far away as bases in Kuwait, Wise said. ``Ideally we want every soldier and piece of gear to be able to identify itself ... so we can dispense with the radio chatter of old in which 65 (percent) to 75 percent was consumed with, `Where are you and what are you doing?''' said Douglas Johnson, a professor of national security affairs at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. Johnson saw how technology could aid in close-quarters conflict a couple of years ago, when a squad of soldiers in a simulation were handed night goggles, global-positioning technology and special intersquad radios to catch a sniper _ an exercise that often results in simulated casualties of a dozen or more killed. The troops with the new technology moved at three times their normal speed and neutralized the sniper with one soldier killed and one wounded. But thqt's this isn't a good laboratory,'' said Army spokesman Tim Rider, who is working at Camp Doha, Kuwait, with technology that constantly updates British and American units with the location of both friendly and enemy troops. Hundreds of commanders can use the technology through computers mounted in vehicles withil m`ch Army unit. They can add details about enemy troops and their own movements, which are then beamed by satellite and shared among everyone with the equipment. Rider said the computerized troop locator basically keeps tabs on vehicles and isn't meant to track individual guerrillas who may be roaming throughout a city the size of Baghdad. Indeed, much of the technology U.S. forces in Iraq have been relying on in the desert may become useless in urban warfare. Global positioning satellite signals may cut out when troops crawl into tunnels or dart through buildings, experts say. Text and photographic traffic is regularly blocked in urban combat, and even basic radio can fail altogether, they say. There is some question whether the military even has mastered the current technology. RAND Corp. analysts have warned that the military's rapid adoption of technology may leave many troops unfamiliar with what they're carrying. Johnson wonders what role the new technology has played in the war's friendly-fire incidents _ attacks that global positioning technology is intended to avert. ``The systems are apparently not working in harmony yet,'' Johnson said. ``We do not yet know what the real causes (of the mishaps) are, but it is clear that the high-tech systems are not yet perfect.'' Military officials ent"their suppliers are watching to see how their soldiers and equipment work on a real battlefield. RB END SEPER (Chris Seper is a reporter for The Plain Dealer of Cleveland.
