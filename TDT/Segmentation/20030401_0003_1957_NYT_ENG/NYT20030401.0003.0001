The Mets made the playoffs in 1999 and the World Series the next year. But the Mets missed the playoffs the past two years and fired their manager, Bobby Valentine. Now, with a new manager, Art Howe, and several new players, the Mets expect to return to the postseason. When they signed Piazza to a seven-year contract after the 1998 season, the Mets set a time frame to win a championship in the prime of his career. But time is running out. ``We've only been to the World Series one time with him,'' Fred Wilpon, the Mets' owner, said last week. ``We need to be there more. That's the goal.''&lt; Wilpon has emphasized a family atmosphere since he bought out Nelson Doubleday to become the principal owner last August and his son, Jeff, assumed greater responsibility as the Mets' chief operating officer. But Wilpon is also a driven competitor, and his decision to fire Valentine after last season proved that his patience was finite. Howe has the security of a four-year contract but a team owner who is more involved than ever. General Manager Steve Phillips built two playoff teams around Piazza and has surrounded him with established veterans at most positions. But the outfield has questions, half the lineup hinges on players rebounding from their worst seasons and the pitching rotation had two openings entering the final week of spring training. Perhaps most glaring, Piazza's batting average has dropped the past two years, dipping below .300 for the first time last year. He turns 35 in September, past the age at which most catchers look to ease the burden on their bodies. But Phillips still believes in Piazza. ``I have no thought or expectation that he won't get back to the numbers that he's produced in the past,'' Phillips said. ``None of those other catchers are Mike Piazza. Comparing him to what happens to other catchers just isn't apples to apples.'' During spring training, Howe put off any thought of a position switch for Piazza. But regardless of where he plays, Piazza can carry a team for only so long. He has three years left on his contract, and Piazza views this season as a turning point for the Mets. The team has six primary players whose contracts will expire after the season, including Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz, Pedro Astacio and Armando Benitez. ``There's obviously a lot of guys who could change and we could be very different,'' Piazza said. As proof of their intent to win now, the Mets' off-season centered on adding more veterans like pitchers Tom Glavine and Mike Stanton. Phillips preaches the correlation between experience let the free-agent third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo leave without making him an offer and funneled that money to the often-injured left fielder Cliff Floyd. Unable to sign another third baseman, they handed the position to the rookie Ty Wigginton. They ehtended their budget to add Glavine to an aging rotation. ``It's not just Mike and the years he's caught,'' starter Al Leiter said. ``Look at the age of all the guys on the team. It's not any type of secret this team is built to win now. We're absolutely built to go to a World Series. We have guys that have done it.'' (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) The Mets entered camp with the third-oldest 40-man roster in the major leagues, behind the Cardinals and the Yankees. The average age of 28.675 did not factor in Graeme Lloyd (35) and Jay Bell (37), who made the opening day roster, or Tony Clark (30), who should join the team within a week. Of the eight position players, only Wigginton (25), Roger Cedeno (28) and Floyd (30) are younger than 33. In the projected rotation are Glavine (37), Leiter (37), Steve Trachsel (32), David Cone (40) and the injured Astacio (33). Leiter understands that age increases risk, but he also realizes youth can be fragile. ``I had my first shoulder operation when I was a 23-year-old,'' he said. ``My second one, I was almost 25. I see a lot of young kids around here rehabbing their shoulders and elbows. I also know that my last seven years have been absolutely the best of my career.'' Leiter's point is clear: veterans have learned how to succeed and stay in shape. And Wilpon believes most of the Mets' core players should have three to four more prime years. ``But the fact is we blended that with young players and will continue to blend because our system is starting to produce,'' he said. ``I think it's obvious our system was dormant for too long.'' Wigginton, a product of that system, will start at third base with Bell as a safety net. Prospects like shortstop Jose Reyes and pitcher Aaron Heilman are expected to contribute at some point this season. Glavine, who was courted by Wilpon during the off-season, needs 58 victories to reach 300. Wilpon vowed that he would provide Glavine with a competitive team for the length of the three-year, $35 million contract he signed in December. ``I'm not going to play forever, and I'm certainly on the back end of my career, so the opportunities for me are going to get fewer no matter what,'' Glavine said. ``That's just a reality for me that my chances are going to start diminishing, but I don't think you look at it in terms of, `Oh, geez, I only have four more chances,' because who knows.'' Another New York team was built around a franchise player. For 15 seasons, the Knicks tried to surround Patrick Ewing with a cast that could win a championship, but they never won a title. When Ewing finally left, the Knicks crumbled. Piazza views his situqt)gn as different from Ewing's. ``I'm proud of the position I've had in this organization, but I don't look at it that way,'' Piazza said. ``Baseball is a team sport, an extended-team sport. That was pretty obvious when we went to the World Series. There's not one player that's going to shape the destiny of an organization.'' But Piazza, who is as skilled at deflecting attention as he is at swatting a baseball, has changed the course of the Mets franchise. The pressure to win with him has increased every year since his arrival five years ago.
