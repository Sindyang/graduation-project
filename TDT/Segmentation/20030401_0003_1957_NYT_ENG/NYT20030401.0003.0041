British sticky toffee pudding is not what Americans would cql,(pudding: it is a moist ginger cake, soaked through with buttery caramel sauce. To help satisfy New Yorkers' infatuation with all things caramelized (consider creme brul%m and dulce de leche), sticky toffee pudding has made its way across the Atlantic and turned up on menus at Five Points, Craft and Blue Smoke. The best one is at Nicole's on East 60th Street, in the New York outpost of the Bri|4622943729'41762 Farhi. The chef, Annie Wayte, serves puddings that come straight from the Mary Poppins nursery. The sticky toffee pudding has a tender crust and aHdeep-brown caramelized flavor. In season, Wayte uses fresh persimmons rather than the traditional dates to keep the cake moist. A good slosh of custard (usually instant) is the standard topping for puddings; at Nicole's, Wayte pours a creamy, vanilla-flecked custard sauce that smoothly counters the sugar and spice of the cake.
