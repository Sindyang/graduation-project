His $500,000 roving TV studio is the gizmo with the most razzle-dazzle in a war where marvelous inventions (videophones, satellite phon%s,, cell phones, nightscope lenses, digital cameras and battery-operated laptops), combined with unusual cooperation between the media and the military, have made Operation Iraqi Freedom the most television-accessible war in history. That combination of access and technology has provided viewers with remarkable journalism and touching TV moments. One highlight last week came when NBC/MSNBC reporter Kerry Sanders phoned home to Sugar Land, Texas, for wounded Lance Cpl. Joshua Menard of the 2nd Battalion 8th Marines. ``It just seemed like a logical thing to do,'' said Sanders. ``He was lucid and wanted to talk to us and I asked him if he wanted to say anything to family and friends.'' Connecting a faraway story to worried folks back home is a terrific example of how ``embedding'' reporters _ allowing them to travel with the troops _ has benefited both viewers and the image of the military. Sanders, it would turn out later, was among the first to transmit pictures of alarming finds in a ``hospital'' in An Nasiriyah _ evidence of apparent POW torture and hundreds of chemical suits. His reports have stood out, along with reports from CNN's Walt Rodgers, ABC's Ted Koppel, Fox's Rick Leventhal and CBS' Byron Pitts. They are among the hundreds of players in the battle for television viewers. Eleven days into the war, two networks have emerged as slightly better than others in providing balanced reporting, NBC among broadcast networks, MSNBC amonw!#mble networks. NBC has multiple outlets _ the ``Nightly News'' and several prime-time news hours each week as well as reports on its morning ``Today'' show and sister networks MSNBC, CNBC and Telemundo. ABC and CBS are only a whisker behind. ABC tripped at the start, caught shorts-down and 20 minutes late getting to air when the first U.S. missiles were launched March 19. The situation snafued from there when the network signed off its war coverage at 10 p.m. CST after promising more to come, leaving some markets (Houston not among them) in the lurch. But ABC recovered handsomely. For example, Friday's ``20/20'' included a series of brilliant reports, including John Quinones' interview with an Umm Qasr family grateful to be out from under Saddam Hussein's thumb, and Barbara Walters' report on U.S.-ensconced Iraqis speaking out against Saddam Hussein. CBS, which has had to weave war news into college basketball coverage, has taken optimum advantage of its sterling magazines _ ``60 Minutes,'' ``60 Minutes II'' and ``48 Hours Investigates'' _ to provide context and great prose in its news coverage. The cable networks are less interested in perspective and more interested in being first with the news and continuous. MSNBC is leading, for reasons already cited and because of no-nonsense anchoring from Lester Holt, a headline-updating service every 15 minutes and soft touches like its wall of heroes, where pictures of servicemen and servicewomen are displayed. CNN and Fox are a step behind. Two of CNN's biggest assets, Christiane Amanpour and Wolf Blitzer, are behind desks instead of doing what they do best: reporting. Reporters John King and Nic Robertson have become sideline players as CNN makes optimum use of yts emr;;:2case unto itself. It proudly wraps itself in the U.S. flag and openly cheers on Bush. Television critics may recoil at how unbalanced the network appears, but some Americans following the war apparently approve. A half-million more people are watching Fox (3.6 million) than CNN (3.1 million). MSNBC is far back (1.6 million) and CNBC trails (300,000), according to Nielsen Media Research. XXX END OF STORY $$$
