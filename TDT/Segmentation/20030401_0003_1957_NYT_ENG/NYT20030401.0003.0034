At one point in ``Fellini: I'm a Born Liar,'' Donald Sutherland recalls a deleted scene from ``Casanova'' in which, as he puts it, ``Fellini makes love with a man.'' The actor does not correct his slip _ it is Casanova, the character played by Sutherland, not the director, who is amorously engaged _ which is almost as telling as his having committed it in the first place. In addition to being, by his own admission, a fabricator of untruths, Federico Fellini was a consummate narcissist. His movies, neo-realist or phantasmagorical, black-and-white or color, grand or merely grandiose, were at bottom all about himself. This is not meant as criticism. In the long interview that takes up most of this fascinating new documentary, Fellini recounts a dream, in which Picasso serves him an omelet, and reflects on the affinity between them, which is less a matter of artistic style than of temperament. Speaking in 1993, a few months before his death, Fellini is not so much indulging in vanity as placing himself in appropriate company. In a posthumous appreciation in The New Yorker, Clive James wrote that Fellini's ``individuality resided in his being able to see what was universal about himself,'' and that his ability to reflect his country and his personality through the bright lens of his art made him ``one of the great men of the modern world.'' There are those who would quarrel with that assessment, and who might even deny that Fellini should be counted among the great postwar Italian filmmakers. I am not one of them, and neither, from what I gather, is Damian Pettigrew, the director of ``Fellini: I'm a Born Liar,'' which opens on Wednesday at Film Forum. Pettigrew's affection for Fellini and his films animates this documentary and limits its appeal. Aficionados will be enthralled by the master's ramblings and ruminations, thrilled at behind-the-scenes glimpses of his working methods and delighted to sample snippets of his movies, ones famous and obscure. But for skeptics and novices, the experience will be less satisfying: familiarity with Fellini's life and his oeuvre is assumed. There is no biography beyond the restatement of some well-known facts: he grew up in Rimini, the Italian seaside resort, and was married for many years to Giulietta Masina, who starred in many of his pictures. The film clips and interview subjects seem to have been selected haphazardly, and are identified only at the end. Sutherland and Roberto Benigni may be easy to recognize, but even the most passionate devotees of Italian cinema may find it hard to identify Fellini's off-camera collaborators _ like the screenwriter Tullio Pinelli or the cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno _ by sight. Their contributions are nonetheless fascinating, and ``Fellini: I'm a Born Liar'' is best understood not as a biography but as a kind of master class, a seminar in aesthetics conducted by Fellini, with ample and intelligent footnotes supplied by Pettigrew. Fellini, impish and eloquent, tends to explain his art either through abstractions or discussions of technique. The art itself, however, is peerlessly, magically sensual, and when we hear him talk about memory, dreams, sexuality and fear it is helpful to see how these ideas have taken shape in his movies. In addition to scenes from Fellini's movies, Pettigrew revisits some of the locations where they were shot, as if to show the alchemical transformatioa puppeteer, a scientist, a painter and a deity. After seeing this film, you may not be content to take him at his word. Luckily, though, his films supply the proof.
