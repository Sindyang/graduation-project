Lawyers for American Airlines were minutes away from filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy papers in a New York courthouse Monday afternoon when pilots averted the crisis by agreeing to a concessions deal. The last-minute vote capped a dramatic two-day marathon of nonstop bargaining in which leaders of the pilots, flight attendants and mechanics unions hammered out deals with airline executives to meet the company's own deadline. Combined, the three unions agreed to give up $1.6 billion through salary and benefit cuts as well as layoffs, in hopes that the savings will keep the world's largest airline financially aloft. The givebacks will deeply affect Fort Worth-based American's 70,000 unionized workers. Salaries will be cut, benefits will be slashed, employees will work longer hours, and hundreds will lose their jobs. Still, many employees said they were relieved that for the moment the deals appeared to have staved o0 million under Chapter 11, and closely guarded pension plans could fall prey to the cuts. Negotiators worked around the clock and had been in nonstop talks at the company's pilot training center for more than 30 hours by Monday afternoon. Union officials described hours of frenzied debate among exhausted negotiators and labor leaders. Mechanics and flight attendants announced tentative agreements shortly after noon, and employees and airline officials expected a similar deal from pilots. Reporters and television crews assembled at the union's headquarters waiting for news of an agreement. But behind the scenes, board members argued over the proposed concessions package. Many of the provisions weren't written down, yet, and there was some confusion about the contents of the package, said Sam Mayer, a union board member. The pilots final vote came only after John Darrah, president of the Allied Pilots Association, called board members to tell them that American's lawyers had arrived at the courthouse in New York prepared to file, Mayer said. ``We literally had John on the speakerphone, screaming at us that we had to make a decision because the lawyers were walking up the courthouse steps,'' Mayer said. At the same time, American's board of directors had convened for their second telephone conference of the afternoon, prepared to approve a bankruptcy filing. ``We came within minutes _ hours certainly _ of having to file,'' said Armando Codina, a Florida developer and member of American's board. Minutes before a filing, at about 5 p.m., the pilots board voted 12-6 to approve the deal, said Mayer, who voted against the package. Mayer cited moves by American Chief Executive Don Carty in- pbessing the issue. ``Carty kept upping the ante until basically a majority of the board said, `I don't care what I have to give them, we'll do whatever it takes to stay out of bankruptcy,' '' he said. In a statement, Carty said the concessions ``have enabled us to avoid an immediate filing with the bankruptcy court.'' He also said that he would take a 33 percent cut in his base pay, would receive no bonus this year and would ask the airline's board to significantly reduce the fmpensation packages for him and other senior officers. Employees will also get a new stock option and profit-sharing program, Carty said. But he warned that the airline still needs to wrest savings from its vendors, lessors and suppliers if it wants to survive. ``The financial condition of American is weak, and its prospects remain uncertain,'' he said. American officials declined to comment beyond Carty's prepared statement. The negotiated packages still must be approved by union members, which could take two weeks. Union leaders said they were preparing ``road shows'' to describe the cuts and sell the plans to employees. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) nn
