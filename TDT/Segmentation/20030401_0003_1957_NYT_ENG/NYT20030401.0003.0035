c.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE@ AMMAN, JORDA -- Alleged Iraqi plots to contaminate water supplies used by Jordanian and U.S. troops on the Iraqi border, and to bomb a hotel in Amman frequented by Western journalists have been thwarted in recent days, authorities said Tuesday. Jordanian and Western officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that five Iraqi diplomats who have since been expelled from the country^@were behind the failed plan to spike the water line that runs from Zarqa, 17 miles northeast of Amman, to military bases in eastern Zo2lan where U.S. forces are in place. They added that four Iraqis arrested last week intended to bomb a luxury hotel. Western diplomats identified it as the Grand Hyatt in western Amman, where some 70 journalists are staying. Madian al-Jazerah, the Hyatt's marketing communications manager, said the hotel was unaware of the alleged plot. But other sources said the Iraqis set off a primitive incendiary bomb at the hotel's executive lounge. The flames were extinguished by the building's sprinkler system. The plans to target Americans come amid widespread hostility in Jordan to the war in Iraq and deep sensitivity over the U.S. military presence in the area. ``We are concerned about increased potential threats against American citizens here and worldwide,'' said Justin Ciberell, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Amman. Tough new security measures have been put in place in recent weeks to ensure that popular opposition to the war among Jordanians does not spin out of control, including declaring the volatile Palestinian Bekaa refugee camp a closed military zone with access subject to government approval. Jordanian officials admit there are an unspecified number of U.S troops currently operating Patriot anti-missile units to defend jordan'{0qim a repeat of the Scud missile attacks launched against it during the 1991 Gulf War. But the government rejects claims made by Saddam Hussein's regime last month that Washington is using its territory or airfields along its eastern border as launching pads for operations in Iraq. ``Jordan is not a party to this conflict. There is no activity inside Jordan against Iraq,'' Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Ragheb said on Sunday. However, unmarked aircraft, including what appeared to be Chinook helicopters, F-16s and transport planes, werebspotted Monday flying across a newly created military zone near the Iraqi border, and there have also been sightings by locals of U.S. troops accompanied by Jordanian minders. American secret service officials, who operate out of a room marked ``press center'' at the Baghdad Cafe hotel in the border town of Ruweished, close to the military bases, on Sunday confiscated from a San Francisco Chronicle reporter film shot in the area. Experts and Western diplomats say Jordan has given logistical aid to U.S. special forces operating in western Iraq, and that Washington has used AWAC surveillance planes to launch air strikes in addition to manning the Patriot batteries. Jordan's heavy reliance on U.S. economic aid and its geographical position between Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia has put King Abdullah in a difficult position. The country is keen not to upset Washington as it did during the Gulf War, when King Hussein sided with the Iraqi dictator, and has decided not to support him publicly this time around. There is much at stake economically for Jordan. With the decimation of its tourist industry during the past 29 months of Israeli-Palestinian violence, widespread poverty and a jobless rate of around 16 percent, the kingdom is ill placed to weather the losses of around $2 billion -- one quarter of Jordan's GDP -- that analysts predict could result from the war in Iraq. Jordan is set to receive $700 million in economic aid, including $250 million to address its ``most pressing budgetary needs and debt service obligations'' as part of the $75 billion war budget President Bush proposed to Congress last Tuesday. Jordan would also receive $406 million in military aid subject to approval from Congress. New business opportunities could also come from the reconstruction of a post-Hussein Iraq. But Jordanian public opinion is vehemently anti-American, and openly voiced evmnemong members of Jordan's Press AssociaTmon, who this week took to the streets of the capital cha,ting anti-U.S. and anti-war slogans. Leith Shebilet, a Jordanian architect who is a prominent figure in the Islamic community, admitted to being ``very, very sympathetic to Saddam'' and feeling ``betrayed'' by King Abdullah for allowing U.S. troops on Jordanian soil. Earlier this week, Shebilet was one of 99 well-known Jordanians, including four former prime ministers, who presented Abdullah with a statement warning him he was ``losing legitimacy'' with his pro-U.S. stance. Referring to public rage over the issue, Shebilet said, ``It may not blow up this month or next. But most certainly it's going to blow up, most certainly.''
