In a statement attributed to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader called on Tuesday for a holy war, or jihad, against the American-led invasion of Iraq. ``They are cursed. They are evil,'' said the statement, which was read by the information minister on national television. ``You will be victorious and they will be defeated. Hit them, fight them!'' Saddam appears almost nightly on Iraqi television, ostensibly leading conferences on the war. But his statement on Tuesday was delivered by Information Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, leading to a new round of speculation about Saddam's whereabouts or health. ``Fight them(eVarywhere, as you fight them today,'' the statement said. ``Don't give them a chance to take a breath until they withdraw and retreat from Islamic land. And they will be cursed today and forever.'' There was no immediate response from Washington. Analysts with the CIA have checked each of Saddam's television appearances since the war began in an effort to discern whether the broadcasts were recent or made by a Saddam lookalike. Al-Sahhaf, continuing to read from the statement, which was delivered in Arabic and translated into English, said: ``The aggression that the aggressors are carrying out against the stronghold of faith is an aggression on the religion, the wealth, the honor and the soul and an aggression on the land of Islam. ``Therefore jihad is a duty and whoever dies will be rewarded by heaven,'' he said. ``And God will be satisfied with their sacrifice. Take your chance. This is what God requested from you.'' ``Long live our nation! Long live Palestine! Long live Iraq!'' the statement continued. ``Let's go and do jihad.''
