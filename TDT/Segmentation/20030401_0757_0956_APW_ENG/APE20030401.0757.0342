Police on Tuesday arrested a senior leader of an outlawed Islamic extremist group, who allegedly planned attacks on minority religious groups in Pakistan. Shabira Fauji of the banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group was captured in an early morning raid at a house in Multan, 635 kilometers (395 miles) south of Islamabad, said regional police chief Malik Murid Hussain. Fauji is suspected of planning and carrying out dozens of attacks on minority Shiites Muslims in this predominantly Sunni Muslim country. His group has been accused of killing hundreds of Shiite Muslims. In 1990, they were responsible for slaying Sadiq Ganji, a diplomat from Iran which is a theocratic Shiite country. Several police officers also have died in gun battles or attacks. Hussain said Fauji was behind an attack on the Iranian Culture Center in Multan in 1997 that left seven people dead, in what was believed to be a reprisal for the killing of a senior leader of a radical Sunni group. ``We hope his arrest will help control religiously motivated killings,'' Hussain said at a news conference. Fauji, who was born Shabir Ahmed and whose adopted name means ``army,'' had a 1 million rupee ($16,950) reward on his head. Hussain did not say if anyone was being given the money for Fauji's arrest. Fauji has been on Pakistan's most wanted list since 2002, when police killed the chief of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Riaz Basra, in a shootout. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was one of seven militant groups outlawed 15 months ago by President Pervez Musharraf in an attempt to end the killings among Shiites and Sunnis. But religious violence has barely slackened here. Dozens of people are killed each year, most of them Shiites and Christians. Historically, many Sunnis regard Shiites as heretics because of a dispute dating back to the 7th century and centering on the rightful heir to Islam's leadership following the death of the Prophet Muhammad.
