A jury was asked to decide Tuesday whether a British Army major used a coughing accomplice to scoop the top prize on game show ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'' Contestant Charles Ingram, alleged cougher Tecwen Whittock and Ingram's wife Diana are on trial for allegedly cheating the show. The prosecution says the three hatched a plan for Whittock to cough when the correct answers were read aloud. Ingram correctly answered the million pound (US$1.58 million) question, but the episode never aired and his check was withheld because of the cheating allegations. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin _ whose summing up was delayed by a day after several members of the jury succumbed to coughing fits on Monday _ said the choice before the jury was clear. Ingram left the recording studios after the taping on Sept. 10, 2001, as either a ``genuine millionaire or a fraudster,'' Rivlin said Tuesday. ``Which was it?'' ``The prosecution say there can be no doubt about it. He and his wife and Tecwen Whittock were fraudsters and the evidence placed before you in this case is clear for all to see,'' Rivlin added. ``They say here was a fraud, a scam if ever there was one.'' Whittock, 53, a college teacher, Charles Ingram, 39, and Diana Ingram, 38, a nursery school teacher, all deny a charge of ``procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception.'' Rivlin noted that all three entered the witness box at London's Southwark Crown Court to ``strenuously deny any kind of dishonesty.'' The Ingrams claimed the win was genuine, he said, and Whittock insisted he had suffered a persistent cough for many years. ``They say it may possibly have been a remarkable performance but that it was a genuine performance, and, more particularly, as regard Charles Ingram, his basic case is he got the answers right because he knew them or was able to work them out,'' Rivlin said. The prosecution said that Ingram spent a long time answering questions and read aloud his options several times. Ingram told the court during the 18-day trial that his system was based on military training, ``weighing up the options and taking account of the risks.'' Both Ingrams had appeared on the show previously _ Diana Ingram won 32,000 pounds (US$50,900) and Charles Ingram failed to get past a qualifying round. ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was created in Britain and became an instant evening television hit. Versions of the show have since spread to numerous countries, including the United States. (jw-rb)
