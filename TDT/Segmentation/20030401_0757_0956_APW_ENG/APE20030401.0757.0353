American forces have enough bombs and missiles for the Iraq war, despite an intensifying air campaign focused on destroying the Republican Guard forces arrayed around Baghdad, U.S. military officials say. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala to the southwest. Among the targets, U.S. officials said, was a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say Saddam's son Odai runs a torture center. U.S. warplanes used more than 3,000 precision-guided bombs on Iraqi targets over the weekend, compared to about 5,000 in the previous week, said Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said coalition forces had fired more than 700 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The United States can switch to other munitions if it runs low on the $600,000 Tomahawks, said Marine Col. Tom Bright of U.S. Central Command. ``While we've used a significant amount, we are not dependent on them for the success of our operations,'' Bright said Monday night on CNN television's ``Larry King Live'' program. The U.S.-led air assault has severely damaged the Republican Guard units defending Baghdad, military officials said Monday. They include the Medina, Hammurabi and Baghdad divisions south of the capital and units of the Nebuchadnezzar division, which is normally stationed far north of Baghdad, which have moved south as reinforcements. ``We are going to continue to drop weapons on these units until they either surrender or until they are destroyed,'' Gen. Peter Pace, the No. 2 officer on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on PBS television's ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' Bombing in the Iraqi capital also has intensified, with repeated hits on the Information Ministry and telephone exchanges aimed at cutting off communications from Saddam Hussein's government. As fighting south of the Iraqi capital continued Monday, U.S. troops killed at least seven Iraqi women and children at a checkpoint when the driver of a van they were riding in failed to stop as ordered, Central Command said. An American reporter with the Army unit involved said 10 were killed, including five preschool-age children. The U.S. military is investigating the incident. Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, said his soldiers fired several warning shots at the vehicle and ``it continued to come.'' An Iraqi soldier in civilian clothing killed four soldiers from the same 3rd Infantry Division at a nearby checkpoint with a car bomb on Saturday. ``I guess the driver panicked and hit the accelerator and basically was charging the unit there,'' Blount said in an interview Tuesday on ABC television's ``Good Morning America.'' ``It could just as easily have been a suicide bomber.'' The soldiers involved ``absolutely did the right thing,'' Pace said. ``Our soldiers on the ground have an absolute right to defend themselves.'' Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf strongly criticized the incident and other instances of civilian deaths in the war. ``They are becoming more tense and hysterical,'' he told a Tuesday morning press conference in Baghdad. In the strongest suggestion yet from the Pentagon that Saddam may be dead, Pace said intelligence sources have shown no indication that the Iraqi leader is alive following a March 19 airstrike on a bunker he was believed to be using in Baghdad. That information comes from the same intelligence sources that pinpointed Saddam's location before the airstrike, Pace said. ``That doesn't mean he's dead, but he's not visible publicly and he's not been seen or reported to have been seen by anybody,'' Pace said. Meanwhile, fresh U.S. forces were flowing to the Gulf, including 500 members of an Army cavalry regiment being sent ahead of schedule to help protect U.S. supply lines from Iraqi attack. McChrystal, vice director of operations on the Pentagon's Joint Staff, told a news conference that more than 300,000 allied forces were in the Gulf region, about 250,000 of them American. Last Friday his boss, Gen. Richard Myers, had put the allied total at 270,000. McChrystal would not discuss specific missions of the additional forces that were en route to the Gulf or getting ready to go.
