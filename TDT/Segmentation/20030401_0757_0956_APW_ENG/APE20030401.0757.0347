Unable to prevent the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Russia is trying to carve out a role for itself and burnish its human rights record by immediately sending aid for the potential victims. President Vladimir Putin has warned of a ``humanitarian catastrophe'' in Iraq, and Russia last week laid the groundwork for tent camps in Iran that could house 5,000 refugees. On Tuesday, a Russian doctor announced an effort to evacuate wounded children from Iraq and urged the United States to cooperate with the initiative, which would require a temporary halt to hostilities in Baghdad and Basra. ``If America says, for instance, from 1800 hours to 2400 hours we will not bomb,'' then children could be evacuated, pediatrician Leonid Roshal told a news conference. Roshal, who is working alongside the Russian Red Cross on the evacuation effort, said the idea was his own but that Putin has expressed support. Putin decorated Roshal for aiding hostages seized by Chechen rebels in a Moscow theater last October. Roshal had defended Russian security forces' use of a gas that led to the deaths of more than 120 hostages, saying it was the only way to end the crisis without massive loss of life. Roshal said the first step in the Iraq program would be to try to remove wounded children, who could be treated in Russia and other countries and returned to Iraq after the war. He said the Iraqis had told him of 95 wounded children in hospitals, but said the figure should be verified. Meanwhile, the Russian government's aid mission near Iraq has had little effect: So far, there are no refugees in the area of Iran where complete supplies for two camps are ready, said Viktor Beltsov, spokesman for the Emergency Situations Ministry, which is running the operation near the city of Kermanshah. Nonetheless, Beltsov said, ``Russia plans to augment its humanitarian efforts in the region'' and is prepared to set up a field hospital if needed. It's a role Russia took on in Afghanistan, where Moscow emphasized it would not fight but showed it would do its part in the U.S.-led war against terrorism by establishing a significant humanitarian presence with aid shipments and a field hospital in Kabul. In Iraq, however, the emphasis on aid comes hand in hand with vehement criticism of the war and U.S. foreign policy. The Russian efforts around Iraq come amid U.S. accusations that Russian companies provided military aid to Baghdad and amid long-standing criticism from rights groups about Moscow's treatment of victims of its own wars in Chechnya. ``It's necessary to help first of all refugees from Chechnya in Ingushetia, who have been living in tattered tents for years,'' said Lev Ponomaryov, director of the For Human Rights organization and an opponent of the Iraq war. ``I cannot condemn humanitarian actions that help people survive,'' Ponomaryov said. ``But it looks inconsistent of Putin, and I would point out that tens of thousands of refugees in Ingushetia need humanitarian aid.''
