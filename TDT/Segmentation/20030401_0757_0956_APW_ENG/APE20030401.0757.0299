New Zealand slalom specialist Claudia Riegler announced her retirement on Tuesday, nine years after her debut in the alpine skiing World Cup. The 26-year-old Riegler, who competed for Austria up to the age of 17 before joining the team of her mother's homeland New Zealand, won four World Cup slalom races, the last one six years ago in Laax, Switzerland. Despite her wins, Riegler called her fourth place at the 1996 World Championship in Sierra Nevada, Spain, her career highlight. She later struggled to recapture her winning form after being repeatedly sidelined with a knee injury, but carved out her only podium finish in six years last December when she came third at Lenzerheide, Switzerland. ``I don't know what I will do with all my free time now, but I feel healthy and ready for a new challenge again, `` Riegler told Austrian state TV channel ORF in an interview. She has lived in Salzburg. She said she would stay in New Zealand for a while, ``as I feel a real Kiwi and very much at home there.'' Riegler represented New Zealand at the Nagano and Salt Lake City Olympics in 1998 and 2002. In Utah she finished 11th in the women's slalom. In June, Riegler, who is dubbed ``Skiwi'' in New Zealand, wants to return to her ``second home'' where she volunteered as the patron of a charity race for a foundation supporting children suffering from cancer.
