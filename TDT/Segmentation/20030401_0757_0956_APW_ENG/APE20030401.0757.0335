The hotel involved in the second plot was identified by sources as the Grand Hyatt, where a small fire in one of the hotel's upper floors last week was blamed on an electrical short circuit. Hyatt officials only said they were unaware of a terror plot. Iraqi Embassy spokesman Jawad al-Ali declined comment to the AP. But he told Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo that the allegations were ``completely untrue'' and that Iraq was keen to preserve Jordan's security. Jordan said when it expelled the five Iraqi diplomats that they had carried out actions ``incompatible'' with their diplomatic duties. The government later said two could stay, but the Iraqi embassy said all five had already left the country. Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said the expulsions were ordered on ``security'' grounds. He and other government officials declined to elaborate, saying it was inappropriate to incite a public spat with Iraq as regional tension rose over U.S. and British bombardment of Jordan's eastern neighbor. One day following the deportation, Jordanian authorities detained four Iraqi transport officials for questioning. No details emerged from the interrogation, but officials said the four _ two employees with Iraqi Airways and two with a joint Jordanian-Iraqi transport company _ had been released. The expulsions and detentions fueled tension with Iraq, which already had been suspicious of Jordan for allowing U.S. troops to be stationed near its border, despite Jordanian assertions that the ``several hundred'' Americans were in the kingdom only for defensive purposes. Aware of strong anti-war sentiments among Jordanians, the government has been striving to distance itself from the conflict on Iraq _ supplier of all its oil needs at cheap prices. Trade with Iraq amounted to US$700 million last year, making it the largest importer of Jordanian goods. Jordan announced last week that oil from Iraq ceased on the first day of the war on March 20. Iraq blamed Jordan for the halted oil flow and accused the kingdom of blocking overland shipments of food and medicine. Jordan denied it, saying local exporters were concerned over road safety. ^ (jjh-pfg) &lt;
