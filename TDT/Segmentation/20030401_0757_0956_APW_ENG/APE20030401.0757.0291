Two people appeared in court Tuesday on charges of stealing flowers left as tributes outside the home of a British soldier who died in Iraq. Andrew Clewes, 34, and Deborah Febery, 32, appeared at Stoke-on-Trent Magistrates' Court accused of stealing around eight bouquets from outside the home of Cpl. Stephen Allbutt. Allbutt, 35, was one of two British tank crew members killed on March 25 when they were mistakenly fired upon by another British tank. Clewes was ordered jailed pending a further court appearance, while Febery was released on bail on condition that she not enter the district of Stoke-on-Trent where Allbutt's widow lives. (rb-jw)
