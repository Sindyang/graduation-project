The leader of Sweden's main opposition Moderate Party, Bo Lundgren, said Tuesday he will resign this October because of bickering about his leadership. Several party officials had publicly blamed Lundgren for the Moderates' unexpectedly weak performance in national elections last September. The conservative party garnered just 15.2 percent of the vote, down 7.7 percent from the 1998 election, to retain 55 seats in the 349-member Riksdag, the parliament. Despite the drop, the Moderates remained the biggest opposition party to the governing Social Democrats, which have 144 seats. Five other parties hold the remaining 150 seats. The Moderates are the only Swedish party to support the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Lundgren, 55, said his resignation would take effect at the party's annual meeting Oct. 23. He said the decision _ which transforms himself immediately into a lame-duck leader _ should allow party activists to concentrate on the approaching challenge of Sweden's Sept. 14 referendum on whether to join Europe's common currency, the euro. Activists must concentrate on selling the merits of the euro, he said, not his own disputed skills as leader. ``If we are to create conditions for a `yes' to the euro, we must avoid destructive personal discussions,'' Lundgren said at a Stockholm press conference. Sweden, Britain and Denmark are the only European Union members that don't use the common currency. Lundgren wouldn't speculate on who party activists would most likely select as his successor Oct. 23. Lundgren served as finance minister from 1991 to 1994. He succeeded former Prime Minister Carl Bildt as the Moderate leader in 1999. But analysts say Lundgren suffered from a charisma deficit. ``He has always appeared as a technocrat,'' political analyst Arne Modig said. ``He has found it difficult to develop a personal, warm and human appeal.''
