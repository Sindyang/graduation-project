Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Tuesday that rebuilding postwar Iraq is a task for the international community. Speaking at his weekly press conference, Fogh Rasmussen was confident that the U.N. Security Council would settle on a proposal to oversee Iraq's construction. ``It should be possible. All the countries have an interest in rebuilding Iraq,'' he said. ``We cannot just let the Iraqi people be left to themselves.'' Denmark, a Scandinavian country of 5.3 million, is part of the U.S.-led invasion against Iraq, having deployed a submarine and naval escort ship to the Persian Gulf. No matter how Iraq is rebuilt, he said reconstruction must cover more than the damage inflicted by the war, but also by ``12 years of U.N. sanctions,'' which were imposed after Iraq was ousted from Kuwait in 1991. Last week, Germany's development minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, said the United States and Britain should shoulder most of the cost of rebuilding Iraq after invading it without U.N. approval. Fogh Rasmussen, flanked by two plainclothes police, didn't say how long he thought the war would last. ``From the beginning, we knew that it was not an easy and simple operation,'' he said. Security at the press conference was increased after Fogh Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller were doused with red paint inside Copenhagen's parliament building March 18 by two anti-war activists. Besides the increased police presence, reporters were searched before allowed into the room. Fogh Rasmussen said the increased security was because of the paint incident, not any specific threat against him or the country. (jo-mpm)
