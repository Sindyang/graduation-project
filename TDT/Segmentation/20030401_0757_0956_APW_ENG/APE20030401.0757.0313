More than a decade ago, Diego Fernando Rincon's family escaped Colombia's violence by moving to the United States, where he joined the U.S. Army. Last Saturday, Pfc. Rincon, 19, became the first Colombian-born U.S. soldier to die in Iraq when a car bomb blew up at a military checkpoint. Three other American soldiers and the driver _ said to be an Iraqi noncommissioned army officer _ also died in the blast. Car bombings are commonly used by leftist rebels and drug traffickers in Colombia's civil war, which has dragged on for 38 years. But little did Rincon's family expect that he would fall victim to a car bomb in far-off Iraq. Luis Rincon, Rincon's uncle, said he had been proud to see the young man join the U.S. Army. Luis Rincon, the mayor of the Colombian town of Mosquera, told The Associated Press that he was looking forward to seeing his nephew, who planned to visit his homeland after the war in Iraq. ``He wanted to come to Colombia after the war to get to know the good parts of the country,'' Rincon, his voice choking with emotion, said in a telephone interview Monday night. Diego Fernando was born in the town of Mosquera, 15 kilometers (10 miles) west of Bogota, the Colombian capital. His family immigrated to Conyers, Georgia, in 1989 and had not returned since. Relatives who stayed behind sent him homemade videotapes of his homeland, his uncle recalled. ``He was very nostalgic about things that had the colors of Colombia,'' his uncle said. ``We taped for him the streets of Funza, Mosquera, Bogota.'' In Conyers, a town east of Atlanta, yellow ribbons honoring the dead soldier adorned every mailbox in his neighborhood. His yellow Mustang was draped with American flags and other memorabilia. The young Rincon signed up for military service after he graduated from Salem High School in Conyers, reportedly telling friends and family that he wanted to avenge the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and protect his adopted country. ``My son Diego was a very brave man, and we are all very proud of him,'' Rincon's father, George, told reporters outside his home.
