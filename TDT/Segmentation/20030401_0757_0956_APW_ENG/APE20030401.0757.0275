A Russian navy squadron is set to depart for the Indian Ocean next week in the largest naval deployment since the Soviet times, a news agency reported. When the Russian navy ships reach the Indian Ocean, they plan to take part in joint maneuvers with the Indian navy, the Interfax-Military News Agency reported, quoting an unidentified official at the General Staff of the Russian armed forces. Participating in the voyage are the Black Sea Fleet's flagship missile cruiser Moskva, escort ships Pytlivy and Smetlivy, landing ship Cesar Kunikov and several supply ships. The Pacific Fleet is sending anti-submarine ships Marshal Shaposhnikov and Admiral Panteleyev and a tanker, the agency reported. It said the ships were scheduled to set out to sea from next Tuesday. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov has said repeatedly that the naval deployment was unrelated to Iraq. In an interview published Tuesday, he reaffirmed that the Russian navy ships weren't going to the Persian Gulf. The deployment ``isn't aggressive or directed against nations of the region,'' Ivanov told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. Ivanov said joint maneuvers with the Indian navy was a possibility, but didn't give any further details of the deployment. The Russian navy's presence in world oceans has been slightly reduced since the Soviet collapse. Most warships have languished berthside due to a lack of fuel and spares. ``The navy was staying dockside for many years, the seamen were losing their skills and people abroad stopped recognizing our ... flag,'' Ivanov said in the interview. ``Why don't we correct this defect?''
