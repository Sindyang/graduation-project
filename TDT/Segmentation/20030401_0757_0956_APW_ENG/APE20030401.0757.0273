Evidence found during a raid indicates that the Bosnian Serb army illegally spied on NATO troops and international officials in Bosnia, a NATO spokesman said Tuesday. An analysis of evidence found March 7 during a raid of the Bosnian Serb military intelligence offices in Banja Luka indicated the military had been spying for at least all of last year, said Capt. Dale MacEachern. NATO peacekeepers seized documents indicating that the Bosnian Serb Army had ``collected and maintained intelligence'' on peacekeepers, European Union police and the office of Bosnia's top international official, Paddy Ashdown, MacEachern told reporters in Sarajevo. The spying also had targeted Bosnian state institutions and private citizens, he said, adding that it appeared the Bosnian Serb government had approved of the activities. ``These actions equate to treating legally constituted organizations, charged with administering and keeping the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as hostile organizations,'' MacEachern said. Branko Trkulja, a spokesman for the Bosnian Serb Defense Ministry, declined to comment, saying the ministry had not received official information about the alleged spying. The 1995 peace agreement that ended 3 1/2 years of fighting in Bosnia requires Bosnia's two armies to act in a transparent manner. They are obliged to help the peacekeepers, international officials and local authorities. The peace agreement divided Bosnia into two separate parts: the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. Each part has its own army, but the two are linked by a joint parliament, presidency and government. The evidence of spying was handed to Ashdown, who as the top international official has the authority to impose laws and fire local officials as high as presidents if he considers them to be obstructing the peace agreement or Bosnia's development toward a modern democracy. Ashdown is expected to decide by the end of this week on what kind of measures to take, his office said Tuesday. (acr/sl)
