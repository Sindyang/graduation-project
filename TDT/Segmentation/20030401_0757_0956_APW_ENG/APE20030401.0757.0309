Hong Kong pop star and actor Leslie Cheung leapt to his death from a five-star hotel here on Tuesday, local television stations and radio reported. Cheung, known locally as Cheung Kwok-wing, plunged to his death from a building in Hong Kong's Central District, radio RTHK reported on its Web site. Two Hong Kong television stations carried the same report. Police declined to provide a full identity but said a man surnamed Cheung, whose given name included ``wing,'' leapt from a hotel room in the Mandarin Oriental, a luxury property in Hong Kong's Central district. Cheung was certified dead at 7:06 p.m. (1106 GMT) after arriving at Queen Mary Hospital, police said. A suicide note was found on the body, police spokeswoman Catherine Chiu said. The 46-year-old Cheung rose to fame as a singer in the 1980s with a bad-boy image and followed up with a distinguished film career. One of few Chinese stars to portray openly gay characters, Cheung starred in the Oscar-nominated ``Farewell My Concubine,'' in which he portrayed a homosexual Chinese opera singer who falls in love with a fellow performer. Cheung also played a Hong Kong man who moved to Argentina with his male lover in Wong Kar-wai's ``Happy Together.'' He also appeared in other Wong films, including ``Days of Being Wild'' and ``Ashes of Time.'' Mandarin Oriental confirmed a body was found in front of the hotel early Tuesday evening but declined further comment. ``The matter is currently in the hands of the police,'' general manager Peter Lowe told The Associated Press by phone.
