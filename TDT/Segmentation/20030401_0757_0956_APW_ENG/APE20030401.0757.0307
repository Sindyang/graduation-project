European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said global political tensions from the war in Iraq makes it all the more important for the World Trade Organization's current round of talks to be successfully completed on time. ``After all, there are not many areas in international governance which can bring good news in the coming months. WTO may be this area,'' Lamy said at a news conference in Thailand. Lamy urged completion of the so-called Doha round of WTO talks by the end of 2004, even though several interim deadlines regarding the opening up of agricultural trade have been missed. He added that the EU was monitoring the risk of the Iraq war derailing WTO talks. However, when asked whether the tension between the EU and the United States over the war in Iraq would hurt global trade talks, Lamy said both sides have agreed to address their differences carefully so there is no spillover into trade issues. France and Germany have strongly opposed the war in Iraq while Britain has become America's staunchest ally. Lamy said WTO's multilateral system with its rules, discipline and enforcement mechanisms was now more necessary than ever. What the world's economy ``needs in the present circumstances is more of that rather than less of that, hence the sort of added impetus we believe it should give to the ongoing negotiations,'' Lamy said. He also dismissed comments made earlier Tuesday by Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile. Vaile blamed the EU and Japan for the WTO's failure to meet a Monday deadline to agree to a broad framework for liberalizing agricultural trade, saying they were opposed to reform. Lamy said Vaile's comments were only part of usual tactics in complex negotiations ``to scapegoat the partners.'' Lamy was in Thailand en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he will preside over the opening of a European Commission office. He was also expected to take part in talks with Southeast Asian economic ministers in Luang Prabang, Laos on April 4.
