Bravida ASA, which installs telecommunications and computer systems, said Tuesday it will eliminate 950 jobs, or 6.5 percent of its work force. Makers of telecom equipment have been hit hard as operators and providers cut back spending on their current networks and push back plans for new, faster networks in a bid to preserve cash. ``All the network operators we work with are downsizing and not investing,'' Bravida spokesman Sverre Auestad said. He didn't disclose the customers. He said 700 jobs in Norway will be eliminated, along with 250 positions in Sweden. Another 450 Norwegian workers will be put on temporary leave. Before the new round of cuts, which take effect in May, Bravida employed 14,500 workers in Scandinavia, including 6,500 in Norway, 6,300 in Sweden and 1,700 in Denmark. Last year, Bravida eliminated 1,000 jobs because of weak market conditions. The Stockholm-based company was created after Telenor ASA of Norway spun it off in 2000. Bravida is not publicly listed. _ _ _ On the Net: Bravida: http://www.bravida.no/bravida/en/ (mpm)
