ROME (AP) _ AC Milan's Brazilian midfielder Leonardo said Tuesday he is retiring from play but will remain with the club in an administrative role. The 33-year-old Leonardo made two appearances for the team this season after returning to play for the squad in October. ``My decision is definite,'' Leonardo told a news conference at the team's headquarters in Milan. ``I have chosen to stop my soccer career before the end of the season because I have so many things to look after apart from playing that it becomes impossible to combine training with all the other engagements.'' Club vice president Adriano Galliani said Leonardo would take over as his assistant and be in in charge of a charity organization set up by the team in February. Leonardo played for Milan from 1997 to 2001, helping them win the Italian league title in 1999. After playing a year in Brazil, he returned to AC Milan. Born in a Rio de Janeiro suburb, Leonardo Nascimento de Araujo began his playing career with Brazilian club Flamengo. He debuted for the national squad in 1989 and was a member of their 1994 World Cup winning team. He has also played in France, Spain and for the Japanese side Kashima Antlers. (ic-fd/vls)
