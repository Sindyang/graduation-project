Fighting persisted in Chechnya Tuesday and a mine blast in a neighboring republic killed four Russian soldiers and wounded another, officials said. The violence came amid new efforts by pro-Moscow authorities to assure Chechens that stability is on the way, following approval of a new Kremlin-backed constitution. At least five Russian soldiers were killed and three wounded in rebel attacks in Chechnya over the past 24 hours, an official in the Moscow-backed administration said on condition of anonymity. Two Chechen police were also killed in the capital Grozny, the official said. In a separate incident, a Russian soldier driving an armored personnel career lost control of the vehicle near the village of Petropavlovsk, causing it to flip over, killing four soldiers and injuring four more. It was not clear what caused the driver to swerve. Russian aviation and artillery struck targets across Chechnya, while Russian troops rounded up at least 130 people on suspicion of rebel ties in Grozny and the Vedeno, Nozhai-Yurt and Shali regions. The so-called ``security sweeps'' have been widely criticized by human rights groups, who say they are rife with abuses including killings and torture. Across the border in Ingushetia, four Russian sappers were killed and another wounded by a mine, said Madina Teziyeva, a spokeswoman for the Ingush Interior Ministry. Their unit had been sweeping a road along the route of an army convoy near the Ingush capital Nazran, she said. Mine explosions are a common feature of the war in Chechnya, where rebels routinely lay explosive devices along the routes of military convoys. The mines claim daily casualties and force Russian troops to conduct painstaking sweeps ahead of any vehicles. Ingushetia has absorbed tens of thousands of refugees from the war in Chechnya, but has largely avoided spillover violence from the conflict next door. Also Tuesday, the head of the Moscow-backed Chechen administration, Akhmad Kadyrov, pledged that civilians would receive compensation within two years for property lost or damaged in the war. ``Payment of compensation within such a period is a very serious step for all of us,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying. Kadyrov has been pledging to restore Chechnya's economy, following a recent referendum on a new constitution that firmly binds Chechnya to the Russian federal government. Election officials say nearly 96 percent of voters approved the document. Russian troops have fought two wars in Chechnya in the last decade. The first, in 1994-96, ended with a Russian withdrawal, leaving the republic de facto independent. Russian troops returned in 1999 after rebel incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of apartment house bombings in Russia that were blamed on rebels. (pvs/yb/ee/jh)
