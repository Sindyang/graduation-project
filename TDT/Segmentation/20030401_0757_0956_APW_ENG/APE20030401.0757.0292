A farm worker charged in bombings at two university campuses in Beijing went on trial Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Huang Minxiang, 26, was tried at Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, which said a verdict would be issued in the next few days, Xinhua said. It did not provide any other details on the trial. Huang was arrested while surfing online in an Internet cafe in his hometown of Fuzhou in southeastern Fujian province last month and flown back to Beijing. Police say he confessed to planting the bombs Feb. 25 at the elite Peking and Tsinghua universities to achieve fame. Nine people were injured when the bombs detonated 90 minutes apart. The damage was estimated at 220,000 yuan (US$26,600), Xinhua said.
