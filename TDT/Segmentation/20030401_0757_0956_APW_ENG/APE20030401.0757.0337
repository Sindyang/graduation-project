Congo's government and rebel groups on Tuesday endorsed a power-sharing agreement intended to end their 4 1/2-year civil war, but they remained at odds over how to share the top posts in a new national army. Representatives of the Congolese government, rebels, political parties and civic groups adopted by acclamation a transitional constitution, an agreement on sharing power in a transitional government, and a partial deal on defense and security arrangements The deals, grouped together in a document titled The Final Act, are supposed to be signed by leaders of all the groups Wednesday, mediators said. But it wasn't clear whether President Joseph Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the rebel Congolese Liberation Movement or MLC, would attend the signing in this South African resort. Kabila and Bemba have not yet accepted a deal proposed by mediators under which their forces would merge with other rebel groups into a new national army. Kabila is supposed to give the deal his presidential assent within three days of Wednesday's planned signing ceremony, otherwise it would not be binding under Congolese law. Under the power-sharing deal, Kabila would lead the transitional government. Alongside him would be four vice presidents representing the present government, the two largest rebel groups and the unarmed political opposition. The transitional government is supposed to govern for up to 2 1/2 years, after which Africa's third-largest country would hold its first democratic elections since achieving independence from Belgium in 1960. Mediators welcomed Tuesday's endorsement but admitted the most difficult challenges lie ahead. ``Implementation is the most painful aspect of the deals, because people will have to make concessions on the ground instead of on the paper,'' said George Ola-Davies, spokesman for the chief mediator, former Botswana President Ketumile Masire. ``It was easier for them to reach agreements in South Africa, but it will be much tougher for them to come together at home and make it work,'' Ola-Davies said. But Vital Kamerhe, a Congolese government spokesman, said he was optimistic that the deal would be implemented. ``Now we have a new constitution and a plan to work together with rebels, the political opposition and civil society in a new government,'' he said. The war in Congo broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to back rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila, Joseph's father. They accused him of backing insurgents threatening regional security. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to back Kabila, splitting the country into rebel-and government-held areas. Most foreign troops withdrew after a series of peace deals took hold. But last week Rwandan leaders renewed accusations that Kabila's government is violating their bilateral July 30 peace deal. They accused Kabila of continuing to arm Rwandan Hutu rebels who had fled to Congo in 1994 after killing more than half a million people, mostly minority Tutsis. Key rebel groups also accuse the Congolese government of deploying troops and military hardware in eastern Congo, contrary to the original 1999 cease-fire. On Tuesday a German Catholic charity called Caritas said its secretary general in Congo, Abbe Jean Mwela Kibikie, had reports that troops as saying that troops from Rwanda and Burundi were redeploying in eastern Congo ``in large numbers.'' But Amos Namanga Ngongi, head of the United Nations mission in Congo, dismissed the report. ``I have military observers out there, and they have not told me anything about that,'' Ngongi said. ``As far as we know, there are remnants of Burundian troops, but we have not seen any Rwandans.''
