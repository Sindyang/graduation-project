Forward Dennis Rommedahl, who scored two goals in Denmark's 5-2 win against Romania, and defender Thomas Rytter said Tuesday they're ready to take on Bosnia-Herzegovina in this week's Euro 2004 qualifier. Group 2 leader Denmark, which beat Romania Saturday in Bucharest, plays Bosnia Wednesday in the capital, Copenhagen. It was good news for coach Morten Olsen whose team has been plagued by injuries. The 1992 European Champions will meet Bosnia without veterans Thomas Helveg, Thomas Roel Larsen, Jesper Groenkjaer and Christian Poulsen, all of whom are injured. Martin Lauersen is out of the lineup, too, suspended after getting a second yellow card in Saturday's game. After Tuesday's training session, Rommedahl and Rytter said they were fit to fight. ``I think it looks good,'' Rytter told Danish public radio. ``Time will tell whether I'll be in the lineup.'' The Wolfsburg defender played 34 minutes against Romania and left the sandy pitch with back and thigh pain. Rommedahl had a sore thigh muscle but was expected to recover by Wednesday. Denmark and Norway top Group 2 with seven points each, but the Danes lead on goal difference. Bosnia, which beat Luxembourg 2-0 on Saturday, is fourth with three points. Romania is third with six points while Luxembourg is last with no points.
