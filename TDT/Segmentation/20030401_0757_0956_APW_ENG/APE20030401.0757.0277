Hungary has tightened regulations on the use of its air space in response to a breach of the rules by the United States in February, a government official said Tuesday. Gabor Brody, a deputy state secretary at the Foreign Ministry, told Parliament's defense committee that Hungary now required detailed information about flights seven days _ or a minimum of 48 hours in exceptional cases _ before any military flights can enter its air space. Previously, flight information was provided sometimes only hours before a plane entered Hungarian air space. ``Normally, use of air space between allies is based on the principle of trust,'' Brody told the committee. ``However, there are sometimes concerns regarding military overflights.'' On Feb. 20, U.S. military aircraft officially bound for Afghanistan _ with permission from the Hungarian government _ later landed in the Romanian port of Constanta as part of a U.S. effort to support Turkey ahead of the war in Iraq. At that time, the United States did not have permission to use Hungarian air space for flights related to the Iraq crisis. That permission has since been granted. A U.S. Embassy official later apologized for the misuse of Hungarian air space. (kpk/vg)
