The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should make the sacrifice of stepping down if it would end the war. Saddam ``himself has asked the people of Iraq to sacrifice for their country,'' Prince Saud told reporters. ``He should listen to his own advice,'' Saud said, saying that if Saddam's continued hold on power was ``the only reason for the continuation of the struggle'' he should step down. Saud said he was not calling on or urging Saddam to step down. But asked whether it was too late for such a move from the Iraqi leader, who has pledged never to resign, said: ``Why should it be too late?'' In a joint interview before the war started with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat daily newspaper and Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal satellite television, Saud was quoted as saying that the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved had Saddam accepted a proposal by the United Arab Emirates urging him to step down and go into exile. The prince's remarks then were the closest Saudi Arabia had come to endorsing the idea. Monday, in an interview broadcast on ABC-TV, Prince Saud said he thought there should be ``a cease fire that allows for diplomacy to work'' and that he feels ``frustration'' with what he described as advisers to U.S. President George W. Bush who have pushed for the war with Iraq. He did not name the advisers. ``The president has shown that he was always, always patient,'' Saud said. ``But ... these prognosticators, when the United States needs friends everywhere, have gone so far as to try to convince the American public that their friends are enemies.This is a time for reckoning. This is a time to show who the real friend and who the real enemy is.'' Saudi Arabia, fearful of an internal, Muslim extremist backlash, has been quiet about its support for the U.S. military strikes on Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, the use of Saudi territory by U.S. troops as a launch pad against Iraq produced a cause for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to rally militants. ^ da/db &lt;
