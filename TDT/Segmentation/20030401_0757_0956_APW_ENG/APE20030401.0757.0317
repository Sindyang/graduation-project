Air Mauritius on Tuesday suspended its flights to Hong Kong for a month because of poor ticket sales following the outbreak of a flu-like virus in Asia, the airline's managing director said. Just 75 out of a possible 294 passengers were onboard the airline's last flight to Hong Kong, which was on Monday, said Vinod Chidambaram. Chidambaram said the airline will monitor the situation on a regular basis. The illness, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has prompted officials in Asian countries to enforce little-used quarantine laws, close schools and impose new health screenings on travelers. More than 600 people in Hong Kong are believed to have the dangerous infection. Air Mauritius has two flights a week from this Indian Ocean island of 1.1 million people to Hong Kong. For the time being, it will continue its twice-weekly flights to Malaysia and Singapore, Chidambaram said. The government has advised Mauritians to not to travel to high risk areas unless absolutely necessary. ``Those who have to travel to or through high risk countries during the past two weeks have to report to the nearest hospital or contact a doctor should they show any symptoms of the disease,'' Health Minister Ashok Jugnauth told parliament on Tuesday.
