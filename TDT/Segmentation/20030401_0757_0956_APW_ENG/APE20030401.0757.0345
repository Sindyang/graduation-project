A boat carrying nearly 40 villagers sank in a river in western Bangladesh on Tuesday, killing at least nine people, a news report said. Four others were missing. The overcrowded wooden boat apparently sank after water gushed in through a hole in its hull while it was crossing the Padma River in Chapainawabganj district, private television network Channel-i said. The region, which borders India, is 230 kilometers (145 miles) west of the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Most of the passengers managed to swim ashore, while rescuers recovered nine bodies _ including those of two children _ from the river, the network reported. Four other passengers were unaccounted for. The boat's passengers were mostly Bangladeshi Hindus on their way to visit a religious carnival in India's Murshidabad district on the other side of the river. Hindus make up about 10 percent of the mostly Muslim nation's 130 million people.
