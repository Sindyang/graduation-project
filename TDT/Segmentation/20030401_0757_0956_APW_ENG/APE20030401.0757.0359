The Czech government said Tuesday it is planning to send a mobile military field hospital to the Gulf in response to a new U.N. Security Council resolution that would restart a humanitarian aid program for Iraq. Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla told a news conference Tuesday that the medical unit, with 250 staff members, would first be deployed to Kuwait, joining a Czech anti-chemical warfare unit already stationed there. ``Then a decision will be made on where to move it, depending on where its aid will be needed the most,'' Spidla said. He said the hospital will be allowed to operate both inside and outside of Iraq. The move still requires approval by both chambers of parliament. It was not immediately clear when lawmakers would vote on the measure, but it's approval was considered likely. Defense Minister Jaroslav Tvrdik said the hospital itself would be ready to leave for the Gulf by April 5. The Czech Republic, a formerly communist country of 10 million which has been a NATO member since 1999, is not part of the coalition at war against Iraq, but has 400 anti-chemical warfare specialists stationed in Kuwait in the event Iraq uses weapons of mass destruction. Spidla said Tuesday the hospital too will not operate under the coalition's leadership and will have a purely humanitarian function. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council voted to resume a massive U.N. humanitarian program for Iraq once the U.S.-led war subsides. (nr/vg)
