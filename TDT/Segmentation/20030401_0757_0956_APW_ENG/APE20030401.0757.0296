Bravida ASA, which installs telecommunications and computer systems, said Tuesday it will eliminate 950 jobs, or 6.5 percent of its work force, in May. Makers of telecom equipment have been hit hard as operators and providers cut back spending on their existing networks and push back plans for new, faster networks. ``All the network operators we work with are downsizing and not investing,'' Bravida spokesman Sverre Auestad said. He said 700 workers in Norway and 250 more in Sweden will lose their jobs, while 450 employees in Norway will be placed on temporary leave. Bravida employs 6,500 in Norway, 6,300 in Sweden and 1,700 in Denmark. It cut 1,000 positions last year because of weak market conditions. The Stockholm-based company, which is not publicly listed, is a 2000 spinoff of Telenor ASA of Norway. _ _ _ On the Net: Bravida, http://www.bravida.no/bravida/en/ (mpm-sp)
