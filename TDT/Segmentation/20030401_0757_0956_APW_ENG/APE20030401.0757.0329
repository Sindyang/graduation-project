Jordanian Information Minister Mohammad Affash Adwan indicated there had been Iraqi attempts to undermine Jordan's security but refused to elaborate. ``This is purely a security matter which is being investigated and I can't discuss it further,'' Adwan told The Associated Press. The plot to contaminate water supplies involved five Iraqi diplomats expelled from Jordan on March 23, the sources said. They declined to provide other details, but said the water is pumped from Zarqa, 27 kilometers (17 miles) northeast of the Jordanian capital Amman. Zarqa water plants feed distant villages in Jordan's eastern desert, where there are several army and air bases, including one near the Iraqi border where hundreds of U.S. soldiers are manning anti-missile batteries. ^ MORE &lt;
