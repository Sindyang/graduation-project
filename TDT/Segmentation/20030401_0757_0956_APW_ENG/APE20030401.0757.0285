Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces, Iraq's Olympic headquarters and what was believed to be an Air Force officers club. A steady series of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday morning _ probably against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the strongest blasts in the capital since the war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad on Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. U.S. warplanes also dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht, U.S. Navy officials said Tuesday. Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said 56 people were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 24 dead in Baghdad. He said nine children, including an infant, were killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately killing people. Hillah is my hometown. It is a civilian place,'' he said. Across the Tigris River, a target was hit in the Baghdad center less than a mile (kilometer) from the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are staying. The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. The target was believed to be a former Iraqi Air Force headquarters that was being used as a club for officers and their families, according to Iraqis familiar with the area. The building was reduced to a heap of gray rubble, a few pillars and an outside wall. A statue of Saddam just outside the building was intact. U.S. military officials said allied aircraft also bombed a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Saddam's son Odai is said to run a torture center. Human rights activists have accused him of jailing and brutalizing athletes. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, and they appeared unscathed. Early Tuesday, American forces launched missiles toward Baghdad and the city of Karbala to the southwest. A huge explosion rocked the Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. On Monday night, Saddam, Odai and Saddam's other son Qusai appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing video footage of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining when the video was shot. A statement broadcast by Iraq TV also said Saddam's family members were in Iraq and had not fled. The statement accused the U.S. Department of Defense of starting false rumors. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their ``heroic'' defense of the areas, state television said. A communique read on Iraqi satellite television said members of the 11th Division, which fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families would get 2 million dinars _ about US$670. Saddam was last shown on Iraqi television on Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi TV since the war began, according to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans had hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the broadcasts. Iraqi television was off the air for about three hours Monday morning. But the local media operation was ``as good as it was before'' the attacks, al-Sahhaf declared. Nearly all the telephone lines appeared out in the capital city of 5 million after at least five telephone exchanges were bombed. But the city's power supply remained intact and street lights came on at night. Coalition bombardments have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital.
