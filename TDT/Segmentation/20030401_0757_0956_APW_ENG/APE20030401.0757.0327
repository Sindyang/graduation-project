Israeli cable television operators abruptly dropped the British Broadcasting Corporation's BBC World news channel from their roster of stations on Tuesday after the two sides failed to reach a financial agreement on continued service. Viewers awoke to find a written on-screen announcement where the BBC had been until midnight Monday, saying that beginning April 1, BBC World would no longer be broadcast. Cable company spokeswoman Aliza Khoury said the decision had been reached after negotiations between both sides, and was based on the British station's low viewer ratings and not on the BBC's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has been widely criticized in Israel as biased toward the Palestinians. She said Israeli cable viewers still had a choice of three international news broadcasters; CNN, Sky News and Fox News. BBC News will continue to be relayed by the Israeli satellite broadcaster ``Yes'' and the cable companies are retaining BBC Prime, the British company's entertainment and general interest channel. About 1.1 million Israeli homes have cable TV, while the satellite company has about 310,000 subscribers A BBC statement said the Israeli operators wanted a lower price for the BBC news service. ``As a commercially funded channel we were unable to accept the cable operators' proposal, which wasn't commercially viable,'' the statement said. Neither the BBC nor the Israeli cable operators revealed the amount of money involved. Israeli member of parliament Yitzhak Herzog sent a letter to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon _ who is also acting communications minister _ asking him to intervene to get BBC World restored and adding that the present fighting in Iraq made global news coverage more important than ever. ``I wrote of the importance of this international news channel, which is seen in a million Israeli households, especially at this critical time,'' Herzog said, adding that he asked if the communications ministry would make an effort equal to that it made when CNN was in a similar situation last year. Then, cable operators announced they were dropping the U.S. news channel, for financial reasons they said. That decision followed strident Israeli criticism of CNN for giving more airtime to the family of a Palestinian suicide bomber than to relatives of his victims, an Israeli woman and her 1-year-old granddaughter. CNN acknowledged it had erred and broadcast a series of heavily promoted half-hour specials on Israeli victims of Palestinian terror attacks. Under government pressure, CNN and the cable operators reopened negotiations and in October reached a compromise, details of which were not disclosed. An Israeli parliamentarian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the BBC case was not directly political but was affected by political factors, among which were the absence of a full-time communications minister and Sharon's preoccupation with other matters. Herzog appealed to all parties involved in the latest dispute to show flexibility and seek to resolve the issue. ``I hope they can solve their differences,'' he said. ^ scw-pd
