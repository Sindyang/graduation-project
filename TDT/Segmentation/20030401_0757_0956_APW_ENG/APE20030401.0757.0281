France's prime minister told lawmakers Tuesday that displays of anti-Americanism were ``unacceptable,'' the latest in a string of statements from Paris aimed at smoothing troubled ties with the United States. The government should also be on guard for any signs of racism, anti-Semitism or xenophobia in the frequent protests against the war, Jean-Pierre Raffarin was quoted as saying by spokesman Jean-Francois Cope. France has made a string of comments in recent days to attempt to repair relations with the United States, which have been tense for months over Paris' high-profile opposition to military action in Iraq. Raffarin on Monday said that despite that opposition, France is not an enemy of the United States. Last week, the Foreign Ministry issued a special statement saying Paris hoped U.S.-led forces would win the war in Iraq. ``It is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament at a meeting Tuesday at the prime minister's office. Though the government is insisting it wants to see the U.S. coalition win, the public appears to be much more ambivalent. A poll by Le Monde newspaper and TF1 television station published on Monday said that only 34 percent of respondents considered themselves ``on the side'' of the U.S.-led forces, while 25 percent said they supported Iraq. The telephone poll of 948 people conducted March 28 and 29 said that 31 percent supported neither side. The survey did not provide a margin of error, but polls of that size usually have margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The French government has been on the defensive recently, clearly concerned that its strident anti-war stance is being seen by many on the other side of the Atlantic as a betrayal of Washington. ``France does not turn on its friends,'' declared Christian Poncelet, the president of the French Senate. ``They have taken a position that is not ours, but that in no way dents our good relations.'' Lawmaker Jacques Barrot, who leads President Jacques Chirac's Union for a Popular Movement in the National Assembly, said Paris' opposition to the war should not be read as support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. ``We should not mistake who the enemy is,'' Barrot said. ``We cannot allow the glorification of Saddam Hussein.'' Portraits of the Iraqi leader are held aloft at anti-war marches in France, along with Iraqi flags. The government is also worried about the frequent protests against the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. Angry demonstrators attacked two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights group posted monitors along an anti-war march route to guard against displays of anti-Semitism. The government ``will not tolerate any racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic acts,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as saying. (parf-jc-eg)
