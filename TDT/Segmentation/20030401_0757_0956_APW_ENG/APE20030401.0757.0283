Luis Figo has regained his place in the Portugal team to face Macedonia on Wednesday, keeping out newcomer Deco whose dazzling performance and winning goal against Brazil sharpened competition for a place in the Portuguese midfield. Figo has recovered from a thigh injury which sidelined him in Saturday's 2-1 victory over the world champion, Portugal's Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said Tuesday. Portuguese officials denied reports of tension between Scolari and the former FIFA world player of the year over the coach's decision to call up Brazilian-born Deco. The 25-year-old FC Porto player recently took Portuguese nationality and came on in the second half against the world champion. Figo, 31, had expressed reservations about naturalized athletes playing for national teams, saying ``national anthems can be learned but not felt.'' The Real Madrid star was left off the roster for Saturday's encounter with Brazil and didn't even stay to watch the game. Deco, who came on the pitch in the 61st minute of the Brazil game, will start the friendly against Macedonia in Lausanne, Switzerland, on the subs' bench. Benfica winger Simao Sabrosa exits the starting lineup to make way for Figo in the only change to Saturday's team. That means Portugal will return to its customary attacking midfield lineup, with Figo alongside AC Milan's Rui Costa and Sergio Conceicao of Internazionale. Bordeaux player Pauleta, who netted the opening goal against Brazil, will again be the lone striker. Portugal automatically qualifies for the Euro 2004 championship as host nation. Scolari, who steered Brazil to its world title and took over Portugal at the start of the year, said he wants the team to keep up its winning momentum against Macedonia. ``When we take the first steps towards working well, we have to keep going,'' he said. 'We've got to stay focused, keep up the dynamism and motivation we showed against Brazil.'' The Portuguese are perennial underachievers, boasting some of Europe's top talent but failing to lift a trophy. Portugal was knocked out of last year's World Cup in the first round. Portugal lost its first game under Scolari, going down 1-0 against Italy, but the Brazilian said the team has since improved. ``We're improving by 10-15 percent each game,'' he said. ``I can see we're playing with greater enthusiasm...more commitment, more team spirit. ``If we can keep that rhythm up against Macedonia, it'll be another important step towards the 2004 championship.'' Portugal will adopt more attacking tactics against Macedonia than against Brazil, Scolari said, though he warned the Macedonia game would be no cakewalk. Macedonia lost Saturday to Slovakia and has taken just two points from its four Euro 2004 qualifying games so far. However, Scolari said he was present when Macedonia tied 2-2 with England in October and was impressed by its fast strikers.
