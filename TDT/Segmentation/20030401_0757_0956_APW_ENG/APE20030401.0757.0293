A court here has ruled that the estate of Giorgio Bassani, whose acclaimed novel ``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' was the basis for an Oscar-winning film, should go to the author's children and not to his American-born, longtime companion. The ruling came after years of legal battles between Bassani's family and the companion, Portia Prebys, a professor of comparative literature. In a telephone interview Monday, Prebys confirmed news reports that the court Thursday had ruled against her and said she would wait till she could study the ruling before deciding on a possible appeal. Bassani, who was suffering from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, died in 2000 at age 84. The feud started years before the death when his children and wife, Valeria Sinigallia, began trying to have Bassani declared incompetent to manage his financial affairs. Bassani and Sinigallia were separated. A native of Bologna, Bassani lived much of his life in the nearby Renaissance town of Ferrara, whose centuries-old Jewish life was the wellspring for most of his literary works. ``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' published in 1962, tells the story of an aristocratic Jewish family whose beautiful estate serves as a romantic and illusory haven from the growing persecution of Italian Jews by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Widely translated, the novel was made into a movie by director Vittorio De Sica. The movie won the 1971 Academy Award for best foreign film. (ad/ic-fd)
