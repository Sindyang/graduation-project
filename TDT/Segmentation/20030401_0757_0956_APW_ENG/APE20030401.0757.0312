European Union officials will tell U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell Thursday they want the United Nations to take ``center stage'' in the rebuilding of postwar Iraq. EU spokeswoman Emma Udwin on Tuesday reiterated the European view that the United Nations has ``a unique capacity and experience'' to rebuild civil society in nations ravaged by war. On Thursday, EU officials will make that clear to Powell who will be in Brussels for talks with EU and NATO officials. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will also meet Powell in Brussels, the government in Moscow said. For security reasons, Powell will also meet an EU delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou at NATO headquarters. Officials said the decision to not let Powell visit the EU head office _ only 3 kilometers (2 miles) away _ had ``absolutely nothing'' to do with the recent discovery of listening devices in meeting rooms at the EU complex. ``We expect (Powell) to discuss the war in Iraq and ... whatever will happen postwar,'' Udwin said, adding EU was not ready to discuss specifics given that the war was still ongoing. ``This meeting comes too early for us to discuss detailed plans (but) it is important that we carry on discussions during the conflict,'' said Udwin. Given the souring of trans-Atlantic relations in recent months, she said it was ``encouraging'' Powell was prepared to come to Brussels. In Athens, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas said he wished Powell had come to the EU in the run-up to the war. ``Nevertheless, if he wants to talk on these issues, it is never too late,'' he added. The Iraq war has divided the 15 EU nations and its 13, mostly East European, candidates. Germany and France lead a no-war camp while Britain, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and several East European candidate nations have sided with the United States. As holder of the EU presidency, Greece has been unable to abridge the rift, forcing it to focus on Iraq issues the EU nations agree on, such as Iraq's reconstruction and the U.N. role in that. French President Jacques Chirac emerged from a March 20-21 EU summit cautioning neither Britain nor the United States must have the lead role in post-war administration, saying it would only legitimize the war they started. The EU delegation that will meet with Powell will comprise Papandreou, EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and security affairs chief. Patten said recently that unless the United Nations gets a lead role in rebuilding Iraq, it will be difficult for EU governments to provide significant reconstruction funding. Before Powell left for his trip to Turkey and Brussels, U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he would also discuss with the allies the makeup of a peacekeeping force. ``We have allies with different views. We will be talking about that,'' he said. ``The issue at this moment for us and the Europeans on the diplomatic track is to look at what is going on in Iraq, not in terms of the past, but in terms of what we can do to give the Iraqis a better future.'' ^ (rw-rac) &lt;
