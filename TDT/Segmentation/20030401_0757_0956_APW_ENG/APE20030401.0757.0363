The Czech government said Tuesday it plans to send a mobile military field hospital to the Gulf in response to a new U.N. Security Council resolution that would restart a humanitarian aid program for Iraq. Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla said the medical unit, with 250 staff members, would first be deployed to Kuwait, joining a Czech anti-chemical warfare unit already stationed there. ``Then a decision will be made on where to move it, depending on where its aid will be needed the most,'' Spidla told a news conference. The hospital will be allowed to operate both inside and outside Iraq, he added. The move still requires approval by both houses of parliament. It wasn't immediately clear when lawmakers would vote on the measure. Defense Minister Jaroslav Tvrdik said the hospital would be ready to leave for the Gulf region by April 5. The Czech Republic, a formerly communist country of 10 million which has been a NATO member since 1999, does not have troops taking part in the advance on Iraq, but has 400 anti-chemical warfare specialists stationed in Kuwait in the event Iraq uses weapons of mass destruction. Spidla said Tuesday the hospital will not operate under the U.S.-led coalition's leadership and will have a purely humanitarian function. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council voted to resume a massive U.N. humanitarian program for Iraq once the U.S.-led war subsides.
