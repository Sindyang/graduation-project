Transport workers and teachers planned massive strikes for Thursday that risk crippling public transport in the French capital and hobbling air traffic. The strikes, called to defend France's retirement system for civil servants, are expected to lead to ``very strong disturbances'' in Paris' metro and bus systems, on suburban trains and other local transport, according to the state-run RATP, which runs public transport in Paris. Officials did not immediately predict what fallout the strike might have on air traffic. However, the walkout was called for by the union representing the majority of air traffic controllers and was bound to have an effect. As for teachers, the Education Ministry traditionally provides such data only on the day of the strike. The walkouts are aimed at pressing France's center-right government to keep retirement benefits for civil servants intact, nearly two months after Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin announced plans to reform the retirement system. The pension system needs a dramatic overall to avoid collapse within 20 years. The government is also planning to reform the system that governs France's huge force of civil servants, widely considered a privileged lot because of their special benefits. (parf-eg-jc)
