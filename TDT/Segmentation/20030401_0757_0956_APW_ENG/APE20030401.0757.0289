The government on Tuesday advised Belgians against traveling to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and southern China because of the spread of a mysterious and deadly flu-like disease. ``If the trip is not essential, it is better to postpone it,'' said Health Minister Jef Tavernier. Prince Philippe, the heir to the Belgian throne, postponed his trade mission to Vietnam until the fall because of the disease. Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, Asian governments have invoked emergency measures, including quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been held in isolation in their contaminated apartment building. In Belgium itself, authorities are investigating two suspected cases of SARS. A Belgian soldier is in hospital in Liege with similar symptoms and a man who returned from Bangkok two weeks ago has died in circumstances which may be linked to the disease. ^ rac-pa &lt;
