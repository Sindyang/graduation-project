British and U.S. military officials said Tuesday that Iraqi civilians are providing more assistance to coalition forces and more information on paramilitary and other forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. In southern Iraq, British troops are beginning to replace helmets with berets, lights are flickering on in the port city of Umm Qasr, and schools and shops were reopening _ possibly indicating the tide of the war in the region was turning, British officials said. ``Within the southern area of Iraq, we see a large degree of normality starting to appear amongst the Iraqi population,'' said Group Capt. Al Lockwood, a spokesman for British forces in the Gulf. Significantly, more civilians were informing foreign troops about the whereabouts of paramilitary forces and members of Saddam's Baath Party, British officials said. At a briefing at U.S Central Command in Qatar, U.S. Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks described several instances in which local residents had helped U.S. forces throughout the country, paving the way for successful attacks against ``death squads'' loyal to Saddam. In one case north of the south-central town of Nasiriyah, 100 local tribesmen joined U.S. soldiers in capturing Iraqi military prisoners and removing explosives from a bridge, Brooks said. Lockwood stressed that tensions were still high in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city where British forces have skirmished almost daily with forces loyal to Saddam while trying to provide humanitarian aid to the city's 1.3 million people. Qatar-based satellite channel Al-Jazeera reported that schools and administrative offices in Basra were closed Tuesday on order of Iraqi authorities to avoid civilian casualties should they get caught in fighting. And military operations continued in the region, including a raid on Baath party members in Safwan, said another British spokesman, Col. Chris Vernon. Lockwood said residents were increasingly willing to approach British troops who have ringed Basra to give information about known paramilitaries and other loyalists. ``They realize that we are there to liberate them, not to occupy,'' he said. ``Certainly, there are still military engagements happening with the paramilitary forces, but the aid is flowing into Basra now.'' Also Tuesday, British troops had changed their combat helmets for berets in some southern Iraq towns _ making soldiers appear more friendly and approachable, British officials said. ``It shows that we have confidence in them, and they can have confidence in us,'' he said. Brooks spent much of the Qatar briefing answering questions about the shooting of seven civilians by U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint Monday. He said U.S. forces were in a state of heightened alert after a suicide attack on Saturday that killed four Americans. ``In all cases in checkpoints and otherwise we maintain the right to self-defense,'' Brooks said. ``We've increased vigilance because of the tactics of Iraqi death squads. ``While we regret the loss of civilian lives, they remain unavoidable,'' he said. Brooks blamed the Iraqi regime for using civilians as human shields and punishing those who seem to favor coalition forces. But he acknowledged he didn't know whether the passengers in the checkpoint shooting were being used as human shields and conceded they may have been fleeing Najaf in fear. He said Iraqis have been receiving constant instructions by coalition radio and television programs about not approaching troops. Iraqi fighters have shot women in the back on bridges, put babies in the line of fire and hanged one woman who simply waved to coalition forces, he said. He said despite the threats by the Iraqi regime on its own population, ``people are bold and they're becoming bolder.'' U.S. and British officials have acknowledged there have been few hoped-for uprisings by anti-Saddam Shiite residents of Basra and other southern towns in support of coalition troops. They have attributed residents' wariness to the fact that when Shiites did rise up in 1991, allied forces largely abandoned them and left them to be punished or killed by the Iraqi leadership.
