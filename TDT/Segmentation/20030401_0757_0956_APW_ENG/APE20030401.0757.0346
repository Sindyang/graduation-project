The people, including a woman carrying a baby in her arms, began leaving the plane shortly after 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT), jumping from the open back hatch of the craft into the arms of emergency workers below. A bus pulled up on the tarmac near the plane to take away the group of at least 15 people, which appeared to include several children. Cuban authorities originally had reported there were six children among the 46 people on the craft. It was not immediately clear what was happening aboard the plane that led to the release of the passengers after the hijacking drama that began almost 12 hours before when a man claiming to be armed with grenades demanded to be flown to Florida.
