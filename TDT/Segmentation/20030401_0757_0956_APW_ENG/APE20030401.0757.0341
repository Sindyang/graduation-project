A fire that caused serious damage to a 17th-century castle in suburban Berlin, protected under UNESCO's World Heritage List, may have been caused by building work, police said Tuesday. The fire at the Jagdschloss Glienicke, which broke out Monday afternoon, destroyed much of the roof and the top story of the building before some 150 firefighters were able to bring it under control. The Berlin city government said it was too early to estimate the cost of the damage to the castle, which is used as a conference center. The castle, built in 1683 and renovated in 1859, is situated in extensive parkland close the Glienicke Bridge, famed as a venue for spy exchanges between East and West during the Cold War. Police said the castle's tower had been set up for work on wooden and metal structures at the time of the fire, and they were consulting with contractors to determine whether that work was to blame. ^ (gm-cb &lt;
