Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday welcomed foreign ministers of the Rio Group to the Kremlin, saying their visit should help bolster cooperation between Russia and Latin America. ``The Rio Group is one of the most representative and authoritative international organizations, and the most authoritative one in Latin America,'' Putin said at the start of talks with the Rio Group's troika, which is made up of the foreign ministers of Peru, Brazil and Costa Rica. He said that the troika's visit signaled ``the growing cooperation between Russia and Latin America.'' ``Our economic cooperation hasn't yet reached a high level, but we have been developing political dialogue and cooperation in confronting global challenges, such as terrorism,'' Putin said. ``I strongly hope that your visit to Moscow will give a strong impulse to the development of cooperation with the entire Latin America.'' Peru's Foreign Minister Allan Wagner said that the 19-nation Rio Group was eager to develop closer ties with Russia. ``We highly assess your government's initiative in holding this meeting,'' Wagner said, adding that the first political consultations between Russia and the Rio Group offer a ``historic opportunity.'' The troika met later with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who said the ministers discussed the war in Iraq and its effect on the ``world order.'' ``Both Russia and Latin American countries are for strengthening the role of the United Nations, multilateral mechanisms and principles of international law, on the basis of which controversies, including major international conflicts, should be solved,'' Ivanov told reporters after the meeting. Wagner said the ministers called for a speedy end to the war and a central role for the United Nations during and after the conflict. He said they also discussed ways to make the United Nations more effective. They also discussed Russia's relations with Latin American countries, including investment and scientific and technical cooperation, he said. (pvs/sk/jh)
