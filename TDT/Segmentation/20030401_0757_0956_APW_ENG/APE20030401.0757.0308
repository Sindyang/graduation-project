The U.S. Steel Corp. announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement to buy Serbia's largest steel corporation, the state-owned Sartid Co., in a deal seen as a major boost for the country's crippled economy. John Goodish, a representative for the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, said his firm would pay US$23 million for the bankrupt Sartid steel mill, based in Smederevo, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Belgrade, and its six subsidiaries. The deal should be finalized by the end of September, Goodish said. Sartid, Serbia's largest steel mill, has capacity to produce 2.2 million metric tons of steel and 120,000 metric tons of tin each year. Sartid declared bankruptcy last year, following economic reforms introduced by Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated last month. U.S. Steel would invest US$150 million to improve Sartid's operating processes and US$5 million for environmental and community development projects, Goodish said. The deal does not include Sartid's debts, estimated at US$1.7 billion. The sale is considered a significant step in Serbia's economic recovery from more than 13 years of former President Slobodan Milosevic's ruinous rule, costly war efforts and international isolation. Milosevic now stands war crimes trial before the Netherlands-based U.N. tribunal. (av/sl)
