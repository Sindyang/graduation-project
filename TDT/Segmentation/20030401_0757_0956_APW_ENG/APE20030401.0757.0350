The United Nations should send human rights monitors to Iraq as soon as the security situation allows such a move, a U.N. expert said Tuesday. ``I would go tomorrow if the circumstances allowed it,'' Andreas Mavrommatis told a session of the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. ``There is a lot to be gained by a U.N. presence in Iraq in the future in the field of human rights.'' The Cypriot specialist presented a 15-page report on the rights situation in Iraq to the commission, which is currently holding its annual six week session. The report, which was prepared before the start of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, makes no direct reference to the conflict. But in his speech to the commission Mavrommatis urged both sides to ``scrupulously observe international humanitarian law and shield the civilian population from the consequences of war.'' The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed for US$1.6 million to send observers to Iraq ``when conditions permit,'' spokesman Jose Diaz said Tuesday. Mavrommatis said he reiterated all his recommendations from previous reports. Last year, he urged Iraq to adopt a moratorium on executions, reduce the number of crimes which carry the death penalty and improve prison conditions. He also criticized discrimination against Iraq's Kurds and Shiite Muslims, who have suffered under Saddam Hussein's rule. Cooperation with Iraq was ``a slow, painstaking process,'' Mavrommatis said. Baghdad's replies to his questions and recommendations ``are at times incomplete and unsatisfactory.'' Mavrommatis was appointed in 1999 and visited the country for the first time in February 2002 at the invitation of Iraqi authorities. He planned a further visit earlier this year but ``unfolding events in Iraq forced me to postpone second visit to the country,'' he told the commission. Instead, he met with diplomats from Iraq's mission to U.N. European offices in Geneva on three occasions. Iraqi Ambassador Samir al-Nima said the report was influenced by ``unwarranted and unjustified political considerations,'' and failed to address violations by coalition forces attacking Iraq. He said Baghdad had cooperated properly with the U.N. expert but Mavrommatis had relied too heavily on ``information from sources hostile to Iraq.'' Even as war loomed, Mavrommatis ``should have visited Iraq, to ensure his report was credible,'' al-Nima said. He and other U.N. human rights officials now ``must visit Iraq immediately to see for themselves the human rights violations perpetrated by the bloody hands of the invaders of the 21st Century,'' the ambassador said. Mavrommatis told reporters later that he was ``steering clear of politics,'' but noted he had deplored both civilian losses and suicide bombings aimed at coalition forces. ``We are all praying that an end will come soon to this war,'' he said. Mavrommatis said he had taken a less confrontational approach than other U.N. experts in an attempt to enlist the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities. The approach had achieved some results, such as the general amnesty last October that freed 25,000 inmates after he had urged the step as a way to ease appalling prison conditions. ``I was shocked by the overcrowding,'' Mavrommatis said. ^ (jf-nk-agh) &lt;
