American soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq, an action that could undermine coalition efforts to win over the Iraqi people. A U.S. general expressed regret over the incident but said civilian deaths were ``unavoidable'' in war. The U.S. military said the soldiers, increasingly anxious about the danger of suicide attacks, opened fire Monday when the driver of the van failed to stop as ordered. A Washington Post reporter at the scene said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including five young children. In the first moments after the shooting, a U.S. Army captain accused soldiers of not having fired warning shots quickly enough. The soldiers were from the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which lost four soldiers Saturday at another checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier posing as a taxi driver detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack. In a similar incident, another Iraqi was killed at a checkpoint near the south-central town of Shatra, according to U.S. Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. Elsewhere, the U.S. Central Command said, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a marine's weapon while being questioned. The fatal shooting of the seven women and children happened along Route 9 near Najaf, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the site of Saturday's suicide bombing. At a briefing for reporters at Central Command headquarters in Qatar, U.S. Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks said Tuesday that coalition forces had to maintain a state of heightened alert after the suicide attack that killed four Americans. ``In all cases in checkpoints and otherwise we maintain the right to self-defense,'' Brooks said. ``We've increased vigilance because of the tactics of Iraqi death squads. ``While we regret the loss of civilian lives, they remain unavoidable,'' he said. Brooks said Iraqi forces had intentionally put women and children in danger in other incidents by using them as human shields and had even opened fire on Iraqi civilians trying to flee besieged towns and cities. ``The blood is on the hands of the regime. If there's a question of morality, it really should go back to the regime,'' he said. ``These are women and children and they're on the battlefield.'' Brooks also pointed out that U.S. and British soldiers in Iraq were getting help from some Iraqi civilians, citing instances were civilians revealed the locations of weapons caches and helped capture Iraqi soldiers. The Central Command said initial reports indicated the soldiers who opened fire on the civilian vehicle followed the rules of engagement to protect themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life,'' a Central Command statement said. However, it appeared the shooting could stoke opposition to the U.S.-led invasion among Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington had hoped for a popular uprising against Saddam. Instead, most Iraqi civilians have not openly backed the invasion, apparently waiting to see which way the war will go. According to an account from the Central Command, the van approached the military checkpoint Monday afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop but were ignored. They then fired warning shots but the vehicle kept moving forward. Troops then shot into its engine. As a last resort, the military said, soldiers fired into the passenger side of the car. Two other civilians were wounded, according to the U.S. military, which said it is investigating the incident. ``They tried to warn the vehicle to stop; it did not stop,'' U.S. Marine Gen. Peter Pace told the American channel PBS television. ``And it was unusual that that vehicle would be full of only women and that the driver was a woman. So we need to find out why it was that they were acting the way they did.'' The military statement said 13 women and children were in the van. But The Washington Post, whose reporter is with the 3rd Infantry, said 15 people were in a four-wheel drive Toyota and 10 were killed, including five children who appeared to be under 5. One of the wounded was a man not expected to live, the Post reported on its Web site. In its description of the shooting, the Post quoted a 3rd Infantry Division captain as saying the checkpoint crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough. The Post described the captain watching through binoculars and ordering the soldiers by radio to fire a warning shot first and then shoot a machine-gun round into the vehicle's radiator. When the vehicle kept coming, the captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About a dozen shots of 25mm cannon fire were heard from one or more of the platoon's Bradley fighting vehicles, the Post said. The captain then shouted over the radio at the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' according to the Post. ``It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope I never see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a medic, told the Post. U.S. officials offered the victims an unspecified amount of money as compensation. The European Union head office called the killing ``a horrible tragedy'' Tuesday, and urged forces on both sides of the war to spare civilian lives.
