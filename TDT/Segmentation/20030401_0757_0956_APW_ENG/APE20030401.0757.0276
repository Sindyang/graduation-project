Sweden and India on Tuesday agreed to better exploit the trade potential between the two countries, Swedish Trade Minister Leif Pagrotsky said. ``We have an exciting and promising future ahead of us, both from an Indian and Swedish perspective,'' Pagrotsky told a business summit which included leading Swedish companies Volvo, ABB, Electrolux, and AstraZeneca. Pagrotsky said India plans big investments in infrastructure projects, such as power, roads and transportation, to achieve the ambitious growth target it has set for the coming years. That would offer great opportunities to companies in Sweden, which has traditionally been a strong base for heavy industry and equipment manufacturers, he said. ``I need to make more Swedish companies aware of what is happening in India. They need to see for themselves,'' he said. The Confederation Indian Industry and the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise _ the main business groupings in India and Sweden _ signed a memorandum of understanding to work closely to remove hurdles to improve trade and investment flow between the two countries. Two-way trade totaled US$560 million in the year ended March 2002. Sweden and India will also benefit from working closely on frontier technologies, Pagrotsky said. Swedish companies have invested about US$200 million in India to date.
