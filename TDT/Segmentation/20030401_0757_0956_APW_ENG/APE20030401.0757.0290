Congolese groups on Tuesday endorsed a power-sharing agreement intended to end a 4 1/2-year civil war in their country, but the government and a key rebel group remained at odds over their representation in a new national army. Representatives of the Congolese government, rebel groups, political parties and civil society adopted by acclamation a transitional constitution, an agreement on sharing power in a transitional government and a partial deal on defense and security arrangements The deals, grouped under a document called The Final Act, are supposed to be formally signed by leaders of the groups Wednesday, mediators said. It was not clear whether Congolese President Joseph Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of one of the two main rebel groups, would attend the signing in this South African resort, said Vital Kamerhe, a Congolese government spokesman. Kabila's government and Bemba's Congolese Liberation Movement, or MLC, have yet to accept a deal proposed by mediators under which they would meld their forces _ with those of other rebel groups _ into a new national army. Kabila is supposed to give the deal his presidential assent three days after the signing to make it legally binding under Congolese law. Under the power-sharing deal, Kabila would lead the transitional government, aided by four vice presidents _ one each from the present government, the two main rebel groups and the unarmed political opposition. The transitional government is supposed to govern for up to 2 1/2 years, after which Africa's third largest country would hold its first democratic elections since independence from Belgium in 1960. Mediators welcomed Tuesday's endorsement but admitted the most difficult challenges lie ahead. ``Implementation is the most painful aspect of the deals because people will have to make concessions on the ground instead of on the paper,'' said George Ola-Davies, spokesman for the chief mediator, former Botswana President Ketumile Masire. ``It was easier for them to reach agreements in South Africa, but it would be much tougher for them to come together at home and make it work.'' But government spokesman Kamerhe was optimistic that the deal would be implemented. ``Now we have a new constitution and a plan to work together with rebels, the political opposition and civil society in a new government,'' he said. The war in Congo broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to back Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila, Joseph's father. They accused him of backing insurgents threatening regional security. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to back Kabila, splitting the country into rebel-and government-held areas. Most foreign troops withdrew after a series of peace deals took hold. But last week Rwanda renewed accusations that Kabila's government is violating their bi-lateral July 30 peace deal by continuing to arm Rwandan Hutu rebels who fled to Congo after carrying out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderates from the Hutu majority were killed. Key rebel groups also accuse the Congolese government of preparing for war by deploying troops and military hardware in eastern Congo, contrary to the original 1999 cease-fire, which also envisaged the power-sharing deal. On Tuesday, the German branch of the Roman Catholic charity, Caritas, quoted the agency's secretary general in Congo, Abbe Jean Mwela Kibikie, as saying that troops from neighboring Rwanda and Burundi that had pulled out of eastern Congo last year had returned ``in large numbers.'' Amos Namanga Ngongi, head of the U.N. mission in Congo, dismissed the report. ``I have military observers out there, and they have not told me anything about that,'' Ngongi said. ``As far as we know, there are remnants of Burundian troops, but we have not seen any Rwandans.''
