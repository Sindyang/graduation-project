Bo Lundgren, the leader of Sweden's conservative Moderate Party, said Tuesday he'll resign amid bickering about his leadership. Lundgren, 55, was criticized by several members of his party _ privately and publicly _ after a worse-than-expected showing in September 2002 national elections. The Moderates garnered just 15.2 percent of the vote, down 7.7 percent from the 1998 election, for 55 seats in the 349-member Riksdag, or parliament. Despite the drop, the Moderates remained the biggest opposition party to the governing Social Democrats, which hold 144 seats. The remaining 150 seats are split among five other parties. The Moderate Party is the only party in the Riksdag that has supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Lundgren said his decision to resign at the party's annual meeting Oct. 23 would let the party focus on campaigning for Sweden's adoption of the euro in a Sept. 14 referendum. ``If we are to create conditions for a 'yes' to the euro we must avoid destructive personal discussions,'' Lundgren said at a press conference in Stockholm. Sweden, Britain and Denmark are the only members of the European Union that don't use the common currency. Lundgren wouldn't speculate on a successor, who will be elected during the party meeting. A former finance minister from 1991 to 1994, he took over leadership of the Moderate Party in 1999 from former Prime Minister Carl Bildt, but was criticized for lacking charisma. ``He has always appeared as technocrat,'' political analyst Arne Modig said. ``He has found it difficult to develop a personal, warm and human appeal.''
