Iran insisted Tuesday that the crash of a fuel-loaded pickup truck into the walls of the British Embassy a day earlier was an accident and not a terrorist attack. ``The pickup truck smashed into the wall after the driver lost control due to high speed and slippery roads after a rainfall,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ``It was an accident.'' The truck, loaded with two large containers of gasoline and oil, crashed Monday into the perimeter wall of the British Embassy, exploding in flames and killing the driver. The director of security in Tehran's governor's office, Ali Ta'ala, identified the driver as a 35-year-old employee of the Energy Ministry. Police had called the crash an accident, but one eyewitness questioned how the pickup truck could have made it through openings in the metal barriers on either side of a bus lane that passes in front of the embassy wall. The embassy was the scene of a large anti-war demonstration Friday. Protesters threw stones that broke some windows and police fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. ^ (aad-sd-pfg) &lt;
