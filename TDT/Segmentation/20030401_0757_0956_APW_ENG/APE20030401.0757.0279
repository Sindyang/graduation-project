The prosecution on Tuesday demanded a life sentence for the animal rights activist who confessed to murdering populist politician Pim Fortuyn shortly before elections last May. On the final day of the trial of 33-year-old Volkert van der Graaf, lead prosecutor Koos Plooy said the nature of the crime justified the harshest sentence possible in the Netherlands, which has no death penalty. ``No one must ever again get it into his head to follow this example, to frustrate the democratic process in this criminal and undemocratic way,'' Plooy said. Fortuyn, a colorful, well-spoken academic and columnist, was shot to death on May 6, 2002, in a parking lot after giving a radio interview in the town of Hilversum, 20 kilometers (13 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. He was contending for prime minister on a crime busting, anti-immigration platform and the murder thrust the country into political crisis. Van der Graaf's lawyers were expected to present a counterproposal for a lesser sentence, arguing that Van der Graaf has cooperated by confessing and deserves a chance to someday rejoin society. Judges will go into deliberations after Tuesday's session and render their decision in several weeks. Plooy said Van der Graaf deserved the maximum punishment because he had admitted to Fortuyn's premeditated murder and shown little remorse. ``The only fitting penalty is a lifelong prison sentence,'' he said to cheers from Fortuyn's supporters in the courtroom. During three days of hearings at a high security court in the Dutch capital, Van der Graaf said he had felt it his duty to kill Fortuyn, comparing his rise in popularity to Adolf Hitler. Van der Graaf said he still believes Fortuyn was a threat to Muslim immigrants and other ``vulnerable'' members of society. A psychological report presented in court said Van der Graaf is sane and can be held accountable for his crime, the first political killing in the Netherlands since World War II. Prosecutor Plooy pointed out inconsistencies in Van der Graaf's testimony, citing a note to his girlfriend in which he wrote: ``If I ever give a confession to the judges or media, then it doesn't necessarily have to be the truth.'' Before the assassination, Van der Graaf worked up to 80 hours a week litigating against commercial animal farming and was described by other activists as ``fanatic.'' He was to give a statement to judges later Tuesday. Van der Graaf has said he wouldn't commit the murder again if he could turn back time, but stopped short of apologizing to Fortuyn's family. He said he ``wrestles'' with the question of whether he acted justly. ``Every day I see it before me,'' he said Monday, ``I see myself shoot and Fortuyn fall.'' Several supporters wept silently in court Tuesday as Plooy described the ``cold and calculating'' manner in which Van der Graaf prepared and carried out the killing, walking casually past Fortuyn and shooting him five times from behind at close range. He attempted to escape by foot but was arrested minutes later with the murder weapon in his pocket, gunpowder on his hands, and traces of Fortuyn's DNA on his pants. (tcs/ad)
