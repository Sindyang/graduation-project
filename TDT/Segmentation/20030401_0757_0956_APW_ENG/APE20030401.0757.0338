Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad on Tuesday, including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces, Iraq's Olympic headquarters and what was believed to be an Iraqi Air Force officers club. A steady series of explosions rumbled south of the capital overnight _ probably against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the strongest blasts in the capital since the war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad late Monday night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. American warplanes also dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht, U.S. Navy officials said, and the sound of more planes and heavy anti-aircraft fire could be heard over Baghdad late Tuesday afternoon. Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said 56 people were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 24 dead in Baghdad. He said nine children, including an infant, were killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately killing people,'' al-Sahhaf said. ``Hillah is my hometown. It is a civilian place.'' An explosion also rocked the Old Palace compound in Baghdad shortly after 9 p.m. Monday, and across the Tigris River, a target was hit less than a kilometer (mile) from the Palestine Hotel where many foreign journalists are staying. The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by an earthquake. The target was believed to be a former Iraqi Air Force headquarters that was being used as a club for officers and their families, according to Iraqis familiar with the area. The building was reduced to a heap of gray rubble, a few pillars and an outside wall. A statue of Saddam just outside the building was intact. U.S. military officials said allied aircraft also bombed a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Saddam's son Odai is said to run a torture center. Human rights activists have accused him of jailing and brutalizing athletes. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, and they appeared unscathed. Bombardments by the U.S.-led forces have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital. The Americans also had hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the broadcasts. On Monday night, Saddam, Odai and Saddam's other son Qusai appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing video footage of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining when the video was shot. A statement broadcast by Iraq TV also said Saddam's family members were in Iraq and had not fled, contrary to reports from Washington. Television also said Saddam decorated commanders and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah with medals and rewards of 2 million dinars _ about US$670 _ each.
