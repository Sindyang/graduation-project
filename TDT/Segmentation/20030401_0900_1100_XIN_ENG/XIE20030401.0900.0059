The munitions with Jordanian mark reportedly found in Iraq, if proved to be true, must date back to pre-embargo period, a senior Jordanian official was quoted as saying by the Jordan Times on Tuesday. "If any old stocks are found, they certainly date back to the period when there was no embargo on Iraq and consequently no embargo on shipments of military equipment," said Mohammad Adwan, minister of state for political affairs and minister of information. Referring to media reports that a cache of munitions marked " Jordan Armed Forces" was found near the Iraqi city of Basra, Adwan told Times that "we cannot confirm that this information is accurate." Iraq was imposed on an arms embargo following its troops' invasion into Kuwait, where it was forced out by US-led coalition afterwards in early 1990s. Twelve years later, the country, which borders on Jordan in the northeast, once again met with a US-led coalition who was launching a massive military campaign to disarm Iraq of the alleged weapons of mass destruction.
