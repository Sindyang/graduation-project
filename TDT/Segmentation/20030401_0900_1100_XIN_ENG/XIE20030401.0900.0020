The East African Customs Union, an arrangement to remove trade barriers among the three east African countries, is expected to be set up in November this year, reported the New Vision newspaper on Tuesday. Chairman of the Uganda group of the East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) Yona Kanyomozi was quoted as saying that plans to remove trade barriers in the region were in advanced stages. "In November this year, there is a likehood that the customs union will be established. Internal barriers among the countries will be removed so that we become one," he said. He said a common external tariff would be introduced to protect trade among the member countries. However, EALA members said the political federation of east Africa would take time. "A political federation cannot happen overnight," Maxwell Mwatela, a Kenyan representative to EALA was quoted as saying. The three east African countries are Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Enditem
