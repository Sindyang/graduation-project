The Bangladeshi government suffered a financial loss of some 770 million US dollars in 440 corruption cases in 2002, the Financial Express said Tuesday. A report issued by the Transparency International Bangladesh ( TIB) was quoted as saying that the amount of financial loss by corruption is equivalent to 10.38 percent of the total allocation in the national budget and 67 percent of the foreign aid received in the country in fiscal 2001-2002. Law-enforcing agencies have been considered as the most corrupt ones as usual, followed by local governments and education departments. The TIB's report was based on the 2,778 reports on corruption published in 17 national newspapers and six regional ones in 2002. Of the total, 440 cases identified by the TIB caused 770 million dollars in loss to the government. Authorities were found to have taken actions against corruption in only 29.3 percent of the cases reported in the newspapers. The TIB has strongly advocated the formation of an independent anti-corruption commission, appointment of ombudsman, more press freedom and separation of the judiciary from the executive to reduce corruption.
