An unarmed Iraqi driver was killed by US marines at a checkpoint south of Baghdad on Tuesday, CNN reported. The US marines opened fire on a pickup truck speeding towards them at a checkpoint outside the southern Iraqi town of Shatra, killing the driver and wounding his passenger, CNN said. The truck was not loaded and neither of the men was armed, the report added. On Monday, US troops opened fire on a car which failed to stop at a checkpoint near Najaf, about 160 kilometers to the south of Baghdad, killing seven Iraqi women and children. US troops had tightened security measures at checkpoints since an suicide bomber last week exploded his car at a checkpoint near Najaf and killed four US soldiers. Enditem
