Macao's Health Services has asked the Macao EVA Airways to provide the name list of passengers aboard the BR826 jetliner from Macao to Kaohsiung after a Taiwanese passenger aboard the plane was announced to have fallen victim to atypical pneumonia. The Taiwan health department announced Monday the 13th pneumonia victim found in Taiwan, a 60-year-old woman, and began to trace people who has had direct contacts with her. In a coordinative effort, the Health Services of the Macao Special Administrative Region government asked the air company to help investigate the flight taken by the woman. Meanwhile, Macao residents have been appeased that there is no need to be alarmed by the incident, since after ten days of the latent period of the disease passed, no suspect case of the pneumonia infection has been reported by hospitals in Macao. The SAR has remained intact after the epidemic broke out in the surrounding regions. But it has been on high alert of the disease control. Jetboat companies operating routes between Hong Kong and Macao have for the first time asked passengers to fill in forms of personal information including name, address, phone number and the seat number that they choose to take on jetboats. The nervous atmosphere has imposed pressure on Macao's tourism. Some tourist agencies complained that passenger arrivals via the ports linking to Hong Kong dropped by half during last weekend compared with normal. But there are also others claiming that a new source of tourists emerged as some retired Hong Kong people seeking refuge for a short stay in Macao. Enditem
