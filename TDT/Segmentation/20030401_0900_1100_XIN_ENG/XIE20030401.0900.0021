Eight major Chinese aluminum smelters have announced that they will close all their high energy- consuming and polluting aluminum electrolysis potlines with a combined capacity of 450,000 tons per annum by the end of 2005. Yunnan Aluminum Co., Ltd., Fushun Aluminum Smelter, Chalco Shandong Co., Baotou Aluminum Group Co., Qingtongxia Aluminum Group Co., Lanzhou Aluminum Co., Ltd., Lanzhou Liancheng Aluminum Co. and Tongchuan Xinguang Aluminum Co. Ltd have a combined aluminum electrolysis capacity of 1.04 million tons per annum, accounting for one fifth of the national total of 5.3 million tons per annum. Their Soderberg capacity is 450,000 tons per annum, one fourth of the national total of 1.3 million tons per annum. Unlike prebake potlines, Soderberg potlines have fluoride, SO2, and dust emission much higher than allowed by the State Environmental Protection Administration standards. Pollution aside, Soderberg technology also features low productivity, high material and energy consumption and inferior product quality. The fact that China's Soderberg capacity accounts for one- fourth of its total aluminum capacity is regarded as quite incompatible to the country's status as the largest aluminum producer in the world. Kang Yi, president of the China Nonferrous Metal Industry Association, noted that China's aluminum production capability increased by nearly two million tons per annum in the past two years and mostly employs the environment-friendly prebake technology. The aluminum capacity expansion has not seen an accompanied increase in pollution. "The phase-out of the old Soderberg potlines is not only a commitment of China's aluminum industry to the environment," Kang said. "It will also lift the industry's technical standards and sharpen its international competitiveness." Enditem
