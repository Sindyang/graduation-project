With governmental guidance and technological support, China is trying to erect a national boundary to reign in the Internet, which has long been considered a cyber territory with no demarcation line between countries. The boundary, consisting of various government-sponsored efforts to exercise cyber monitoring or limiting, aims to find and sanction vicious Internet-based activities which are harmful to China and its people's interests, said Hu Mingzeng, director of the Computer Network and System Security Research Center at Harbin Industrial University in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. While recognizing that the Internet can significantly promote China's social progress and connection to the outside world, the government is also paying more and more attention to criminal acts and other minor wrongdoings that it brings about, said Hu. Dubbed "a message splitting the Great Wall", China's first electronic message was sent abroad via the Internet in 1987, followed by nationwide connection in 1994. The latest statistics from the China Network Information Center show that by late 2002 there were 59.1 million Internet users across the country. A survey by Web Side Story, a US-based Internet analysis organization, revealed that China's huge information transport via the Internet has made it the second world cyber power after the United States.
