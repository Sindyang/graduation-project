Editor's Note: On the occasion of the first anniversary of the launching of the Human Rights magazine, the journalists of Human Rights interviewed the Australian, Egyptian, Hungarian and Indonesian ambassadors, and Mexican minister to China. Following are their points of view on China's human rights situation. Mr. David Taylor Irvine, Australian Ambassador: Improved observance of human rights will inevitably accompany the economic reform and opening up that China is embracing. Australia particularly welcomes the increased personal freedoms that the Chinese people now enjoy. The freedom to choose where to work and where to live, to make individual decisions about lifestyle, and the freedom to travel in China and abroad are now enjoyed by the Chinese people and have done much to transform the face of Chinese society. Likewise Australia welcomes the efforts China has made to advance the social, economic, and cultural rights of its people, the measures it has taken to protect the rights of women and children, and the relative freedom of religion the Chinese people now enjoy. Considerable work is also being done to implement the concept of the Rule of Law in China. China's observance of some human rights, such as those that relate to freedom of speech, assembly and association, has improved over the pre-reform era. But, as with many countries, continuous work needs to be done to ensure that practices in China conform with all the universally accepted standards of human rights. Australia is happy to work together with the Chinese government and people on these issues. Mr. Aly Houssam El-Din El-Hefny, Egyptian Ambassador: In general, the present human rights situation in China has been developing side by side with the positive development of the whole society. China's economy has developed rapidly and the living standards of both the urban and the rural residents continue to improve. The Chinese government has always paid full attention to the problems of poor rural population. Consequently, the number of poor population has been steadily reduced over years. The medical and health services have also continued to improve, and the mean life expectancy reached 72 years, which is rapidly approaching the 75 years level of the developed countries. The Chinese government has protected as well the right to work. The number of total employment has been increasing despite of the on-going economic reform, taking into consideration the ever increasing reemployment rate in new jobs. At the same time, the social security system, including the pension insurance, the unemployment insurance and the medical insurance, is improving. The sector of education has also witnessed tremendous improvement. The compulsory education projects in impoverished areas, for example, have been extended. The illiteracy rate among the Chinese people has dropped to almost 4.5 percent, which is an excellent achievement. China also gives priority to promoting the legal system to ensure civil and political rights according to law. All competent international circles acknowledge the progress made by China's government to enhance the rule of law along the whole country. At the same time, significant efforts have been exerted by the Chinese government to ensure the equal rights of the ethnic minorities, which already enjoy the right to regional autonomy. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have strengthened their efforts to fight poverty in ethnic minority areas. In such areas, the protection of the freedom of religious beliefs and practices is fully ensured. Such regions also formulate their own regulations concerning family planning. To sum up, I can say that I am deeply impressed by the achievements of modern China, by its reform and opening up, as well as by its unprecedented positive developments of the various aspects of human rights in the country and wish this friendly country and people more achievements especially realizing Xiaokang by the year 2020.
