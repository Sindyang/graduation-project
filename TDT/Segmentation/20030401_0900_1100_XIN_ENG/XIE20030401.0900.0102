Security around the British embassy in Tehran was tightened on Tuesday after a small truck smashed into the embassy's main gatepost and burst into flames Monday night. A British diplomat said that extra security guards had been placed on duty inside the compound and police had also beefed up security around the perimeter. He added that the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office was considering to send some non-essential diplomatic staff home. On Monday night, a small truck loaded with two large barrels of diesel fuel smashed into the British embassy, in which the 35-year- old driver was killed. Iranian officials said that initial evidence did not suggest it was a terror attack, but an accident. "The investigations until now do not indicate that this was a deliberate attack," said Ali Taala, general director of security and political affairs at Tehran's governors office. Enditem
