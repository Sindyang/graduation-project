Thirteen Vietnamese were charged Tuesday with human and sex trafficking in Cambodia, three days after they were arrested in Svay Pak, 11 kilometers north of the capital Phnom Penh. Khut Sopheang, vice-prosecutor of Phnom Penh municipal court, said they will be imprisoned for 10 to 20 years if the court finds them guilty. The 13 Vietnamese, seven female and six male, were arrested on Saturday after some police officers raided Svay Pak brothel, the biggest of its kind in Cambodia, and rescued 37 trafficking victims, aged five to 16. The arrest was considered to be one of the largest brothel raids in recent years. The Ministry of Interior closed down at least eight Svay Pak brothels and arrested 13 brothel workers from Vietnam suspected of involvement in the international flesh trade. Local authorities at Svay Pak told reporters that the brothel had been operated secretly and in small scale after it had been completely closed for almost two years. Though prostitution is illegal in Cambodia, prostitution and child sex offenders are rampage due to the poverty and lack of law enforcement. Enditem
