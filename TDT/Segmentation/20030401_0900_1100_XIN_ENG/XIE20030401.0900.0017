Myanmar needs to place special emphasis on strengthening the national economy and developing science and technology under the present uncertain world economic situation, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported on Tuesday. In its editorial, the paper pointed out that owing to a vast global gap in economy and wealth, there lacks equal opportunities among the nations of the world. "The world's economic powers discriminate developing nations economically as well as politically and are essaying to enlarge their sphere of influence," it said. The paper attributed the existence of instability in international community and considerable uncertainty about economy and future to the double-standard treatment of big nations toward developing ones. As a result, each nation is forced into a position to resort to protectionism, it said. It said the Myanmar government is working toward a strong national economic life by encouraging the private sector as well as the government economic organizations to develop. The paper also emphasized the need to reinforce such resistance power as national defence and national solidarity. Enditem
