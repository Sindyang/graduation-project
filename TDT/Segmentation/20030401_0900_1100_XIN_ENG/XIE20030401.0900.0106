Indonesia's state-run telecommunication company PT Telkom recorded a net profit of 8.35 trillion rupiah (some 927.78 million US dollars) in 2002 or was nearly double as compared with 4.25 trillion in the previous year, the daily Kompas reported on Tuesday. Telkom President Kristiono said the rise was spurred by the sale of 12.72 percent stake in its subsidiary, cellular phone operator Telkomsel, to Singapore Telecom (SingTel). The sale and purchase agreement on Telkomsel valued at 3.2 trillion (355.56 million dollars) last year. Over the period, Telkom's total income rose by 32.66 percent to 21.4 trillion rupiah (2.38 billion dollars) against 16.13 trillion rupiah. Enditem
