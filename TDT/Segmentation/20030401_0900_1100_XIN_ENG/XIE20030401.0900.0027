The municipal cultural department will sign an official agreement with the Chinese Musician's Association (CMA) and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles (CFLAC) this November conferring the permanent right to host the contest, said Li Zhefu, an senior official with the municipal cultural department. Guangzhou will invest millions of yuan as initial funds to finance the event, said the official, adding that the prize awarding ceremony will be held in the Xinghai Concert Hall and the Guangzhou Opera House, which is planned to be built.
