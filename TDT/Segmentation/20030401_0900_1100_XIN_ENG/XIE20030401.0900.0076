A Kuwaiti Patriot battery intercepted and destroyed an incoming Iraqi missile before it entered the Kuwaiti airspace from southern Iraq, a Kuwaiti army spokesman said Tuesday. Lieutenant Col. Awadh al-Mututah said that Iraq launched the missile at 9:05 a.m. local time (0605GMT). Sirens wailed for five minutes starting from 9:06 a.m. local time (0606GMT) in Kuwait City, only one minute after the missile was intercepted. Earlier in the morning, Kuwait said it fired a Patriot missile on Monday night after a sentry near its border with Iraq reported what he thought was an incoming missile flying below radar level. A Kuwaiti military spokesman said the Patriot missile eventually detonated itself without intercepting any incoming missile. On Saturday, a low-flying Silkworm missile coming from Iraq hit a shopping mall in Kuwait City, the first time that a missile was so close to the city since the US-led war on neighboring Iraq started on March 20. Two people were slightly hurt. Since March 20, at least 18 missiles coming from Iraq have been fired at Kuwait, a key launch pad for the US-British coalition forces' invasion of Iraq. Most of them have been intercepted by Patriot missiles. Enditem
