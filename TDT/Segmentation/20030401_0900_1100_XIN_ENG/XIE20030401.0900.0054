With a little more than a year to go before the 2004 elections, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) has yet to receive money to implement the absentee voting law, Philippine officials said Tuesday. "Overseas absentee voting is not feasible at this time because we have not received a single centavo for its implementation," the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted Comelec chair Benjamin Abalos as saying. Abalos said the Philippine Department of Budget and Management appropriated only 400 million pesos (7.46 million US dollars) in the 2003 national budget for the purpose of conducting the voting abroad. The amount, he said, was not enough to finance the preparations for absentee voting. Comelec has asked Congress for a budget of one billion pesos ( 18.66 million dollars) for this year's preparations, which include the purchase of machines, the printing of application and registration forms, and the training of all foreign service personnel who will oversee the electoral process abroad. The absence of funds for the exercise was very critical as the absentee voting law, signed by Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in February, specified the time frame for its implementation, commissioner Florentino Tuason said. According to the law, registration for the absentee voting should start on May 5. "It's already April and we still have not printed any forms," Tuason said. Preparation for the registration is expected to take seven to ten weeks. Abalos said the commission was all set to implement the law, only did not have the money to do so. Seven million Filipino workers abroad could participate for the first time in the national polls. Arroyo is set to sign the 2003 national budget in April. Enditem
