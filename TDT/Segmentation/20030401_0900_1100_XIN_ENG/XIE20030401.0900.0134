Israeli troops destroyed early Tuesday the house of the Palestinian who carried out the suicide bombing attack outside a cafe in Natanya on Sunday, wounding nearly 60, Palestinian witnesses said. They said that a large number of Israeli soldiers raided the village of Deir El Ghusoon near the West bank town of Tulkarem and blew up by dynamites the house of Mohamed Jamil Ghanem, the Palestinian who carried out the attack. Saraya Al Quds, or Jerusalem Brigade, an armed wing of the Islamic Jihad (Holy War), claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing outside the mid-town London Cafe in the coastal town of Netanya on Sunday. The group said in a leaflet that the attack in Netanya is "a gift" to the Iraqi people. It also said that it had sent a group of suicide bombers to Iraq to kill American and British soldiers. Meanwhile, Palestinian witnesses said that several Israeli army tanks and armor vehicles raided early Tuesday the Palestinian refugee camp of Al Ama'ari near Ramallah in the West Bank. They said that the Israeli army blew up with explosives a three- storey Palestinian-owned house belonging to a family of a Palestinian militant, who has been detained by Israel and accused of carrying out armed attacks on Israel. The residents said that several damages were caused to neighboring houses in the refugee camp, adding that the Israeli soldiers arrested at least 10 residents. The Israeli government decided on Monday to freeze its policy of mass destruction of Palestinian houses in the Gaza Strip, Israel Radio reported. The radio quoted high-ranking Israeli army officials as saying that the Israeli army decided to stop demolishing Palestinian-owned houses during military operations and put on hold its incursion into the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has said that at least 860 Palestinian houses have been either razed by Israeli army bulldozers and tanks, or blown up by dynamites in the Gaza Strip since the Intifada (uprising) against Israel began 29 months ago. Israel claimed that the houses destroyed in the Gaza Strip either belonged to Palestinian militants who carried out attacks against Israel, or were used as shelters for the militants. Demolition of houses has long been a common form of penalty adopted by Israel to punish Palestinian militants who carry out suicide bombings or other attacks against Israel. Enditem
