The US-led coalition forces on Tuesday launched a new round of massive bombardment on Baghdad and the southern city of Nasiriya, while 10 British paratroopers were reportedly killed near Nasiriya by local tribes. At least 10 missile hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad at around 7 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), after a relatively quiet night in the city, a Xinhua reporter said, adding that the targets were not known yet. US and British warplanes flew over the sky and dropped bombs on the city, home to 5 million people. Iraqi anti-air defense forces fired back at the warplanes. Loud explosions reverberated through the city, and a number of military and government buildings were hit in the bombing. A telecommunication center was also bombed in the air strike and the telephone communication was temporarily cut off, said the Xinhua reporter. In Alamwe district, southeast of Baghdad, the US bombing killed 4 children and wounded a number of civilians. Some people were crying on the demolished houses, eye witnesses said. The coalition forces also intensified bombardment on Nasiriya, 375 km southeast of Baghdad, leaving 24 civilians killed and 116 others wounded, Iraqi television reported. In Baajh, northeast of Nasiriya, local tribes attacked the British paratroopers who were trying to land in the area. 10 British paratroopers were killed in the crossfire, said the report. Iraq has staged stiff resistance against the US and British troops, who have been managing to move northward toward Baghdad to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in its central and southern key cities over the past 13 days since the outbreak of a US-led war on Iraq on March 20.
