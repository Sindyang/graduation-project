Britain acknowledged on Tuesday that efforts to win the support of Iraqi civilians for the United States-led war on Iraq could be undermined by civilian killings by US troops. Earlier reports said at least seven Iraqi women and children were killed in a van on Monday when US soldiers manning a checkpoint on a highway near the central Iraqi city of Najaf opened fire on the vehicle. "It does indeed, and if you were a civilian watching that you would interpret it in that way," British army spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon told the BBC radio, answering questions if the checkpoint killings would hurt attempts to win hearts and minds of the local population. However, he said: "If the decision is made that the threat against our soldiers is sufficient that they have to use self defense, then they will be fully supported." Vernon also admitted that local support for the US and British soldiers in Basra, Iraq's second city, had not emerged. Vernon's comments came after British Home Secretary David Blunkett said that Britain and the United States are currently viewed as "villains" by Iraqis and civilians across the Middle East because of the US-led war. "We know that for the moment we will be seen as the villains. We knew that from the reaction before the conflict started," Blunkett told the BBC Newsnight on late Monday from Washington. Enditem
