Palestinian Prime Minster Mahmoud Abbas has said that the outcomes of the US-British war on Iraq will be "destructive," Palestinian Official sources said on Tuesday. In his first public statements after his appointment as prime minister by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, said that the war on Iraq is "destructive and the consequences of this war will affect the whole Middle East region." "We will have to protect ourselves from the outcomes of this war," Abu Mazen told a number of businessmen and private sector traders in Gaza city on Monday. Abu Mazen had held talks during the last few days with representatives and parliamentary figures of different Palestinian factions in line with the ongoing debates aiming at forming the new cabinet of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) within this week. He is due to present the list of his cabinet to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) next week, Palestinian Official sources said. The sources added that the prime minister seemed determined to overcome the difficulties facing his position. Abu Mazen said "my mission is difficult but not impossible," adding "my main goal is to achieve justice and try to make life easier for Palestinians." "There will always be a single authority that will apply the law on everybody without any exceptions," he said. Abu Mazen reiterated that his government will work hard to change the "dramatic situation in the Palestinian territories and will encourage multiplicity and democracy" by starting with " applying the law and achieving security and justice."
