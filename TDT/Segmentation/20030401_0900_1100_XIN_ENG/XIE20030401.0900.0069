Four types of companies listed on China's A-Share market will be popular with overseas institutional investors, including those having an industry monopoly, such as over airports, harbors and expressways, said a leading investment bank. In its research report on China's A-Share market disclosed in mid-March, UBS Warburg singled out preferential choices of shares on that market, which has a capital value of 500 billion US dollars. UBS Warburg was one of the first group of applicants for QFII ( Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) status, and is still awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, including the central People's Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. According to the report, the other three types of companies were those "with Chinese characteristics", for example, alcohol producers and cheap-labor textile enterprises, companies that own valuable self-developed brands, and companies engaged in resources development like coal mines and iron mines. "We hope to get overseas investors who are interested in Chinese stocks into the A-Share market as soon as possible," said Yuan Shuqin, the manager in charge of Warburg's QFII application. Yuan's bank offered a variety of funds for clients who could be an indirect China market investor through purchasing shares of one or more these funds. The bank is planning to employ three more staff to conduct A- Share research exclusively and to give ratings on A-Share companies, according to Yuan. (more)
