Iraq on Tuesday denied that any family member of President Saddam Hussein has left the country after the beginning of the US-led war on Iraq. A spokesman for the Iraqi Presidency said the family of President Saddam Hussein "is part of the big family of the Iraqi people" and "the fate of the small family cannot be isolated from the fate of Iraqi people." The denial came following Western press reports that some family members of President Saddam Hussein have left Iraq. Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said a number of Arab volunteers have arrived in the southern province of Qadisiya, some 180 km south of Baghdad. The agency said the Arab volunteers have expressed their insistence to sacrifice themselves in defense of Iraq and the principles of Islam. Officials reports in Baghdad said over 5,000 Arab volunteers from all Arab countries have arrived in Iraq to fight against the US and British troops. Enditem
