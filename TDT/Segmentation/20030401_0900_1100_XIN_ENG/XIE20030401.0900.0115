The Philippine Presidential Palace was still considering holding the Balikatan 03-1 joint military exercises in Sulu in the southern Philippines, the Presidential Spokesman said here Thursday. Last month, a storm of protests from the local residents forced the Philippine government to cancel the exercises when it was first proposed. The opposition was a result of some misunderstanding and miscommunication between the residents of Sulu and the promoters of the joint exercises, the Philippine Star daily on-line news Tuesday quoted Presidential Spokesman Ignacio Bunye as saying. Bunye expressed confidence that the Sulu people would favor the Balikatan 03-1 exercises in their province and allow the arrival of US troops once everything was put in the proper light. Likewise, he said, discussions between US General Joseph Weber and officials of the Philippine Armed Forces Southern Command on the exercises were still on-going. Local government officials and members of non-government organizations also participated in the discussions. Americans also expected to hold the Balikatan 03-1 exercises in Sulu, which was one of the alleged bases of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Enditem
