Zimbabwe is expected to receive a significant chunk of 55 million US dollars allocated to the African Capacity Building Foundation by the World Bank, local media reported on Tuesday. Among some of the organizations that will receive the funds are the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECF) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development Policy Unit. The Southern Africa Regional Institute for Policy Studies is already benefiting from the fund. The ACBF's executive secretary, Soumana Sako, said on Monday that Zimbabwe was eligible to get support for new projects under the fund. "Zimbabwe is a member of the World Bank and besides the ACBF is an autonomous body which will determine who receives support and who does not," he said. The Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) is set to get 2 million US dollars over three years while the policy unit in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development will receive 1.5 million US dollars. The TNF seeks to strengthen the capacity of the National Economic Consultative Forum to enable it to operate effectively and efficiently through providing a consultative platform to interface with existing organizations. The unit in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development is expected to assist the ministry, the Reserve Bank and economics department at all the country's universities in policy formulation and analyze macro-economic fundamentals. "The recruitment of the staff is now complete and what is left is the launch of the unit which will be done soon," Sako said. He said the establishment of the unit that was mooted in 2000 had taken long due to a number of problems, which included getting approval from the foundation's board of directors. The ACBF is also considering several other projects, which have been submitted from various sectors. The grant was extended through a memorandum of understanding that was signed by officials from both organizations in Harare on Monday. Sako signed on behalf of the foundation while Ohene Nyanin, the country manager for Zimbabwe and Zambia, signed on behalf of the World Bank. The 55 million US dollars, which would be disbursed over a five- year period, was the second and last tranche of the 2.7 million US dollars that was availed to the ACBF by the World Bank in 1999. Sako said the money would be kept in the foundation's trust fund and disbursed to countries that submit sound capacity building projects. "We are a demand-driven organization as opposed to supply- driven which means that the country that submits the most attractive projects would get more support," he said. The ACBF was established in 1991 through the collaborative efforts of the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, bilateral donors and African governments. The foundation represents a response to the severity of Africa' s capacity problems and the challenge to invest in indigenous human and institutional capacity in sub-Saharan Africa. The foundation's mission is to build capacity for sustainable development and poverty reduction in Africa. Enditem
