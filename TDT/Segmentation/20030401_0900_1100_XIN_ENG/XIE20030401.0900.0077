A painting show was held in the Jin Tai Art Museum of Beijing Tuesday to mark the Islamic Republic Day of Iran, with more than 60 miniature and watercolor paintings by well-known Iranian artists Mahmoud Farshehian and Nasrin Dastan. According to the organizer, as an important component of Persian art, Iranian miniature painting originated from the border pattern of the Koran. It features brilliant colors and is fancifully decorative, similar to the traditional Chinese realistic paintings characterized by fine brushwork and close attention to detail. Farshehian, born in 1930, was once a student of Prof. Yimani, a master of traditional painting, and later furthered his study in the Isfahan Art Academy. He is adept in commanding beautiful lines and his use of color gives the impression of wild dancing. His works reveal the secrets existing deep in the heart of men and various creatures, as well as the conflicts and combats between good and evil, beauty and ugliness and knowledge and ignorance, which are the constant themes of Iranian art. In 1993, the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) published a book for Farshehian and UNESCO director-general Federico Mayor praised him as "a world artist". The 35-year-old Nasrin specializes in portraying flowers and natural scenes, which show the artistic perspective of a Muslim woman. Nasrin said she loves Chinese culture and once gave her own exhibition in China. In 2002, she studied for a doctorate in Chinese art history at the China Central Academy of Fine Arts. Ferydoun Verdi Nejad, Iranian ambassador to China, said that both Iran and China have profound ancient culture and have witnessed a long-term friendship. Both Iranian and Chinese art focus on humanism, the spirit of creatures and the theme of peace. He also expressed his hope that the painting show would strengthen communication between the arts circles and peoples of the two countries, as well as the traditional friendship. Enditem
