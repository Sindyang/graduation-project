The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) has commissioned an independent survey on preferred styles of beach volleyball attire in order to assess the preference of players, coaches and the general public of the growing sport. The survey, conducted by the company M.I.S. Trend based in Lausanne, Switzerland, was made in response to debate among male players last season concerning their own style preferences. The survey, which reached out to some 7,000 people posed questions related to fashion versus the sport's image, as well as considering the suitability of a design to allow for maximum athletic performance. Seventy percent of those who responded to the survey, including beach volleyball players, coaches and other interest groups, voted to keep the status quo (dress regulations state men's shorts should be cut 15 centimeters above the kneecap), rather than going for the longer baggy-style shorts. They said that it was best for playing the game and best for both the player's image and the image of the sport. Women prefer shorter shorts. Contrary to the opinion of some male players last season, the survey clearly showed that women prefer shorter shorts. Some 82 percent of women voted for short shorts, while 67 percent of men responding to the survey also preferring the current style. Professional beach volleyball players were split on their preference with only 48 percent backing the short shorts while amateur players, spectators and coaches voted 76 percent in favor of preserving the current style. T-shirts, yes or no. The survey posed the question of whether male players should play topless, but 62 percent of the general public and coaching and amateur playing fraternity prefer to retain the current style of men wearing tops. Women were somewhat cooler on the subject of tops for men, with 44 percent expressing a preference for no t-shirts, while professional players came out strongly in favor, with 64 percent telling M.I.S. they would prefer to play topless.
