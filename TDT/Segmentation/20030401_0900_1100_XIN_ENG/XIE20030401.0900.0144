Eight out of 10 members of the public who had contacts with the Hong Kong Police are "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with its quality of service, according to a recent survey. The survey, conducted by the University of Hong Kong, includes interview with 843 members of the public, representing 1,228 contacts with the force through five main channels: the '999' consoles, reports made in person at police report rooms, by attending crime investigation offices, by being questioned at the scene of incidents and through telephone calls to police stations. Respondents, all over 18, were informants, crime victims or witnesses who had contacted police frontline officers in the three months before the survey -- between July and September 2002. The overall satisfaction rate with police services provided at points of police-public contact rose from 76 percent in 2000 to 80 percent in 2002, representing an increase of four percentage points. Amongst the five channels, the performance of the 999 console was rated the best and attained an overall satisfaction rating of 87 percent. Of particular encouragement is the overall very satisfied percentage increase from 8 percent in 2000 to an astounding 20 percent in 2002, representing an increase of 12 percentage points. Another area recording a significant improvement is in the answering service provided at police stations where the satisfaction rate improved significantly, leaping from 70 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2002 -- an increase of 14 percentage points. Respondents were most satisfied with the politeness and helpfulness displayed by police officers and the efficiency of police services. Enditem
