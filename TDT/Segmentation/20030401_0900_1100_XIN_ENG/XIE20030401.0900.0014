by Sun Yongming DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite having signed a ceasefire, the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army and the Hutu rebels have intensified their military actions in recent weeks, making the prospects for a lasting peace in Burundi look dismal. At least 68 members of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), the largest Hutu rebel movement in the tiny central African country, were killed in the fierce fighting last weekend with the army to the northeast of the capital Bujumbura, according to a Burundian army spokesman. The fighting was confirmed by a FDD spokesman who, however, said that seven army soldiers were killed in the exchange of fire and the Burundian army had exaggerated the losses of the FDD side. Two pupils and one teacher were killed last week when the FDD members launched a sudden attack on a government army checkpoint near a primary school near Bujumbura. The two parities accused each other of violating the ceasefire signed on Dec. 3 of last year in Arusha, north Tanzania after hard negotiations mediated by a facilitation team headed by South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma. As a result of the recent clashes, a new wave of refugees rushed into western Tanzania, which has already sheltered as many as 300,000 Burundians fleeing the devastating ten-year civil war. Last Saturday alone, a total of 168 Burundians were registered as refugees in Kigoma, some 60 km south of the Burundian border. The refugees said the fighting between the government army and the FDD had intensified over the past days. Burundi's civil war broke out in October 1993 when then president Melchoir Ndadaye, the first ever democratically elected president in the turbulent country, was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers. Being in minority, Tutsi, accounting for only 16 percent of Burundi's population, has been ruling the country politically and militarily, but several months, since it gained independence from Belgium in 1962. The United Nations statistics show that at least 250,000 people, mostly civilians, have lost their lives in the conflicts between the army and Hutu rebel groups. Moreover, the exodus of large numbers of refugees has caused many problems to other countries in the Great Lakes region. Thanks to the painstaking efforts by the regional leaders, the Burundian government headed by President Pierre Buyoya and FDD led by Pierre Nkurunziza inked a ceasefire agreement in Arusha, kindling hopes for restoring peace and order in the war-torn country. The promise for peace, however, proved that fragile for the two parties of the ceasefire began to attack each other in various parts of the country, prompting calls for a peacekeeping mission to prevent the train to peace from derailing. Last month, Burundian Vice President Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu, asked African countries to send a peacekeeping force to help restore peace and stability in the country during a meeting with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in central Tanzanian city of Dodoma. Briefing Mkapa, also a leading mediator of the Burundi peace process, on the latest developments in Burundi, Ndayizeye said an African Union peacekeeping force is of vital importance for saving the shaky ceasefire between the government army and Hutu rebels. Some African countries have showed their willingness to participate in the future peacekeeping mission in Burundi, but so far, there has been no indication from these countries on the approximate date for the deployment of the peacekeeping troops. South Africa deployed 700 troops in Burundi in November 2001 to protect those returning politicians from possible attacks from their rivals. In view of the deep-rooted mistrust between Hutu and Tutsi, it is naive to imagine that the ceasefire itself could soon straighten out all problems left over by history. As a matter of fact, gunfire had begun to roar before the ink was hardly dry. In accordance with the power-sharing agreement, Ndayizeye should replace Buyoya, a Tutsi, as the president on May 1. However, Buyoya has recently hinted that he may not step down as planned due to the intensified conflicts. The remarks made by Buyoya add more uncertain factors to the staggering Burundi peace process. Enditem
