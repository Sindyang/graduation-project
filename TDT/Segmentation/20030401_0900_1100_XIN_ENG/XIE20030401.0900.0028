Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has appointed Ignatius Chombo, a cabinet minister, to double as the acting Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education after the post fell vacant following the death of Swithun Mombeshora two weeks ago, according to the Herald newspaper on Tuesday. The report said that Mugabe assigned all the functions of the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education to Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Chombo. Mombeshora died at his Harare home on March 17 and was declared a national hero. He was buried at the National Heroes Acre four days later. Meanwhile, Chombo on Monday held a meeting with the Association of University Teachers at University of Zimbabwe to discuss the current impasse, which led to the closure of the campus after the lecturers went on strike. "We want to get to the bottom of the issues and see if we can come up with solutions to the problems," he said. The lecturers went on strike on February 24 citing irregularities in the awarding of a retention allowance. A retention allowance is only given to medical academic staff and not the rest of the lecturers. Enditem
