A Tamil Tiger boat was sunk by Sri Lankan navy in a clash at sea in the east of the country on Monday, leaving three navy servicemen injured, a spokesman for truce monitors said on Tuesday. Teitur Torkelsson, spokesman of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, said that the navy destroyed one boat of the suspected Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels Monday evening when they returned fire after three or four rebel boats fired at the navy's "Lanka Muditha'' carrying about 1,700 troops from Trincomalee in the east to the northern Jaffna peninsula. Out of the three injured, one was seriously injured in head, he said. He said that truce monitors met LTTE rebels in the rebel-held northern town of Kilinnochchi on Monday and the rebels said they were "surprised" with the clash and they were not involved in the incident. The government and the LTTE rebels have been observing a ceasefire since February last year before the peace talks between the two sides commenced in September. The talks are aimed at ending the country's 19-year ethnic conflict that have claimed more than 64,000 lives. The rebels, who have been fighting for a separate homeland for the Tamils in the north and east of the country, have agreed to settle for regional autonomy under a federal system. On March 10, the navy destroyed a LTTE vessel smuggling weapons with 11 rebels killed on board off Mullaitivu in the north of the country. Subsequently a Chinese fishing trawler was sunk in an attack by suspected LTTE rebels, killing 15 Chinese and two Sri Lankan nationals, in the same area on March 20. Enditem
