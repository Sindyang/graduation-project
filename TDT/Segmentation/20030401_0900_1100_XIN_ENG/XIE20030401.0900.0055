Due to the global economic slowdown, political risks, stock market collapse and corporate scandals in the United States, economic researchers said they have taken their toll on global foreign direct investment (FDI). The UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) warned in a press release issued recently that it will take the global FDI five years to fully recover, but stressed that FDI into the developing world has held up much better, with China and eastern Europe the star performers. The United States suffered FDI inflows drop by almost 80 percent in 2002, FDI inflows fell by 45 percent in 2001, and by a further 22 percent in 2002 to an estimated 580 billion US dollars, it said. China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia and India will be the five emerging markets that make it into the top 20 recipient countries. "FDI inflows into China reached a record 54.7 billion US dollars in 2002, and will continue to expand strongly over the medium term," the EIU said. The trend towards better business environments, regional integration, technological change, industrial consolidation, sharper global competition, and opportunities in emerging markets are the factors underpinning renewed strong expansion in global FDI, it said, adding a recovery will begin during 2003, and accelerate from 2004. It estimated the growth in global FDI in 2003-07 will be much stronger than the growth in world trade or GDP. In the next five years or so, FDI into the European Union as a whole will also be significantly higher than the United States during the period from 2003 to 2007, it said. "The EU will also continue to outstrip the US as source region for direct investment. FDI will remain geographically concentrated, " it said. Commenting on the run-up leading to the war against Iraq and the ensuing uncertainty, the EIU said the uncertainty contributed to the overall decline in FDI in 2002. The high oil risk premium and the impact on overall confidence shaved about half a percentage point off world growth over the past year. Enditem
