Mr. Mihly Bayer, Hungarian Ambassador: The situation of human rights in China changed a lot during the past decades. Thanks to the legal reform opened in 1978, Chinese law has grown markedly in terms of quantity and quality. In the quarter century since the end of the Cultural Revolution, the PRC has engaged in the single most concerted national effort in terms of legal development in Chinese history. The results are impressive and they benefited the whole Chinese society. Hungary has observed the Chinese efforts with great sympathy and is ready to share her experience gained in the last decade during the transition to democracy, rule of law and market economy. China and Hungary, two traditional friends, whose recent history and the challenges they had to surmount in the past have many common features. This is the reason why our two countries started a dialogue on human rights in 2000. We consider the open and constructive exchanges of views on human rights issues with China helpful to both sides. The Hungarian experience proved that a well functioning market economy and the rule of law are closely linked with each other because the market mechanisms can only work in a regulated and calculable legal environment. I am convinced that China is on the best way towards the full application of these ideas, even if her historical and cultural background is quite different from that of Hungary. Mr. Aa Kustia, Indonesian Ambassador: Most of the developing countries have enjoyed progress on human rights situations in their countries, particularly China who has been developing its economy so fast in the past years. The Chinese people have what is enjoyed by the people in developed countries. They are free to go everywhere and free to do what they like as long as they observe the law and regulation in the country. Mr. Jose Oramas Cadena, Mexican Minister: China and Mexico share the same constructive position regarding this topic, and look forward to find more cooperative ways in pushing forward a positive support for the protection and promotion of human rights. In September 2001, the Mexican Vice Minister for Human Rights, Mariclaire Acostaa, visited China and held a series of very fruitful meetings with Chinese officials and organizations on human rights. We have set as a priority to proceed with this dialogue. During the said visit, the Mexican side was deeply impressed by the progress made by China in the protection and promotion of people's rights to subsistence and development; the protection devoted to ethnic minorities and the effective means to grant them autonomy in different levels of self-government; as well as wide religious freedom. On the other hand, it is important to point out that both countries, as developing nations, support the same position that human rights should not be a pretext to intervene in the internal affairs of any country. We are well aware of China's unremitting efforts to build a well-off society in an all-round way, including further develop the economy, improve democracy, advance science and education, enrich culture, foster social harmony and upgrade the texture of life for the people, together with the rule of law and the rule of virtue, as was stated in the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. With these solid foundations China is witnessing an unwavering improvement in human rights compared to the situation before 1949. Enditem
