A policy being drafted by the Ugandan government will give internally displaced persons (IDPs) the freedom to choose where to live, reported the New Vision newspaper on Tuesday. Ugandan government officials, donors and non-governmental organizations representatives met here on Monday to scrutinize the draft national policy on the IDPs. The policy was drafted after recommendations by a study commissioned by the United Nations organization and the Ugandan government to analyze the situation of IDPs over a year ago. The policy will oblige the central and local authorities to protect the IDPs wherever they will be. Opening the meeting, Ugandan Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs Lt. Gen. Moses ALi said Uganda had suffered civil strife, cattle rustling, drought and other disasters since the 1970s. He said over 7 million people have been victims of displacement. Statistics disclosed by the meeting showed that between 1971 and 1979 an estimated 2 million people were internally displaced. Between 1981 and 1986, about 830,000 people were displaced by war and insurgency. The Alice Lakwena resistance and Lord's Resistance Army wars displaced 800,000 people from 1989 to date in the north. The Allied Democratic Forces resistance in the western Rwenzori region also displaced 150,000 people from 1984 to 2000. The policy is a response by the Uganda government to the need to devote attention to the rampant internal displacement of persons. It will minimize internal displacement and its effect on victims of natural and man-made disasters. Enditem
