As Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is spreading and more people were killed, Thailand has been on red alert against the epidemic even though it has no evidence of local transmission so far. On March 31, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinwatra chaired a special meeting to work out ways to prevent the disease, which has infected more than 1,600 people in 15 countries and killed 61. Many Bangkok residents have found their ways to deal with it -- wearing mask and canceling their trips to high-risk destinations. As results of Monday's special meeting, tougher screening has been introduced from Tuesday for passengers arriving from SARS- affected areas and 10 emergency teams of doctors from university, state and private hospitals have been set up to investigate any suspected cases. A quarantine station was set up inside the military base at Bangkok's Don Muang international airport, and arriving passengers suspected of having the disease will be held there for at least 24 hours. In Chiang Mai airport, Songkhla airport and Mai Sai checkpoint in Chiang Rai province, 900 kilometers north of Bangkok, officials have received the same order. The Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan even warned that travelers from countries hit by SARS would be temporarily barred from entering Thailand if health authorities are not confident that their precautions can prevent the mystery disease from spreading locally. At the same time, Thais were also urged to avoid travelling to those destinations and those returning from outbreak areas were recommended to stay away from people close to them for at least 14 days until it is clear they are not infected. Thai embassies and consular offices in high-risk areas were instructed by Thai Foreign Ministry to knock on the door of thousands of Thai workers to check on their condition and submit regular reports on their latest health situation. Moreover, Thai Airways International (THAI) announced Tuesday to canceled 28 flights to Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and other cities affected by a deadly virus, noting the cancellations are also part of a set of measures to guard against SARS. Since the epidemic broke out in the southeast Asia this March, Thailand has implemented tough measures to prevent the disease. However, the atmosphere turned to anxious after local press reported that Italian doctor Carlo Urbani, who is also a World Health Organization communicable disease expert and was admitted to have caught SARS after he identified the virus in Hanoi, died last Saturday in Bangkok's Bamrasnaradura hospital. Following his death, all doctors and nurses at the hospital were required to take their temperature every hour to ensure they were free from the infection. Meanwhile, the reports about the outbreak of SARS began to draw more attention of the readers than the US-led war on Iraq. For the Thai government, the SARS is worse than the war as well for the economic reason. Thai Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha said the outbreak of SARS have a greater potential impact on the economy than the war in Iraq as the number of visitors to the country had fallen by between 5 and 10 percent for the disease.
