A Cuban airliner was hijacked by a man armed with two grenades on Monday night and ordered to fly to the United States, but it was later forced to land in the Cuban capital of Havana because of lacking enough fuel, Cuban officials said early Tuesday. The plane, now standing on the runway at Havana's international airport, had 46 passengers and crew aboard, an official statement read on Cuban television said. "According to reports from the plane, the (hijacker) is at the back of the plane, apparently holding two grenades," the statement said. A Cuban DC-3 airliner with 31 passengers and six crew members aboard was hijacked on the night of March 19 by six people and later landed at Key West International Airport in Florida, the United States.
