Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday, the first day of fiscal 2003, on buying in select blue- chips, but the key Nikkei index finished below 8,000 on continued worries about the Iraq war. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 14.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 7,986.72, after falling as low as 7,866.67. The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) edged up 0.96 point, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. Some blue-chip issues including Toyota Motor and TDK drew buying on dips, but overall gains in exporters were limited amid concerns about the US economy and the weak US dollar in the lower half of the 118 yen level. Volume on the TSE's main section came to 863.83 million shares, up from Monday's 715.09 million shares. Despite the Nikkei's rise, declining issues outpaced advancers 734 to 611, with 161 issues closing unchanged. Telecom, land transportation, and electric power and gas issues were notable gainers, while pulp and paper, banking and chemical shares were the main decliners. Sony, the most heavily traded issue by value, lost 90 yen to 4, 110 yen. Nissho Iwai-Nichimen Holdings, a new holding company launched by Nissho Iwai Corp. and Nichimen Corp. on Tuesday, ended the day at 325 yen after initially fetching 339 yen. Fujitsu rose 5 yen to 325 yen after saying that it and US chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have agreed to launch a new joint venture in the United States to integrate their flash-memory operations. The TSE's Second Section index fell 8.24 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,511.16 on a volume of 17.34 million shares. Enditem
