ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell is coming to Ankara for an unexpected visit on Wednesday, designed principally to win support for opening a northern front in the war against Iraq. After the United States faced a serious resistance in southern Iraq, US officials have begun concentrating on the plans of the northern front, reported the Turkish newspaper Cumhurriyet (Republic) on Tuesday. During Powell's stay in Ankara, issues such as deployment of US soldiers in Turkey, dispatch of US soldiers to northern Iraq via Turkey and use of Turkey's airbases for air strikes against Iraq were expected to be on the agenda, Turkish government sources said. The Turkish parliament on March 1 rejected a government motion on allowing the deployment of 62,000 US troops in Turkey for opening the northern front in the war against Iraq. On Powell's coming visit, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the United States could make new requests, but he did not disclose the content of the requests. The US Administration, disappointed over the developments in the southern front in Iraq, decided to send Powell to Turkey in order to improve relations and garner more support for the Iraq war which has entered the 13th day since its outbreak on March 20.
