The Uganda Presidential Peace Team (PPT) has asked the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to give a date and alternative venue for their first meeting with the northern elders and parliament members, reported the government newspaper New Vision on Tuesday. In a letter written by the PPT to the LRA high command through the northern paramount chief in response to the LRA demand for an unconditional ceasefire in north on March 30, PPT acting chairperson Betty Akech who signed the letter said the PPT were happy to receive the first letter from the LRA high command. She said this showed LRA's commitment and willingness to resolve the ongoing rebellion peacefully. "The PPT assures the LRA commanders that everything possible will be done through negotiation to see that peace prevails in the north," she added. It was recalled that the LRA has written to the PPT, asking the government to expand the ceasefire to cover the entire northern region. The just ended 4th National Conference of the ruling Uganda National Movement on Monday adopted a resolution, calling upon the LRA to take advantage of government's offer of negotiated peace settlement and to reciprocate by appointing their peace negotiating team.
