Air New Zealand has stocked its planes with masks in the past week as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) illness continues to cause international concern. Airline spokeswoman Val Hayes said Tuesday that the decision to have masks available on its planes had been a company initiative. Asked how many masks were on board each plane, she said enough were being carried for them to be used in the way Air NZ intended. "If there was a suspected incident the crew would use them as a precautionary measure, and likewise passengers nearby," Ms Hayes said. The airline's approach to coping with the potentially fatal pneumonia-type illness was welcomed by the Flight Attendants and Related Services Association. Since an announcement last week that a Singapore Airlines flight attendant became infected with Sars on a March 14 flight between New York and Frankfurt, cabin crew at several airlines have stepped up demands that they be provided with masks for their own protection. New Zealand health authorities announced Monday new rules that they had the power to detain and isolate anyone suspected of having the Sars virus, or to isolate others in contact with an infected person. The new rules follow the decision by New Zealand Health Ministry to make Sars this country's latest notifiable disease. Early Tuesday the World Health Organization said 58 deaths had been recorded worldwide from the disease. Enditem
