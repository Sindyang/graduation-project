A Cuban airliner was hijacked by a man who claimed to armed with two grenades on Monday night and ordered to fly to the United States, but it was later forced to land in the Cuban capital of Havana due to lacking enough fuel, Cuban officials said early Tuesday. The plane, now on a tarmac at Havana's international airport, had 46 passengers and crew on board, an official statement read on Cuban television said. The statement said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with grenades. "According to reports from the plane, the (hijacker) is at the back of the plane, apparently holding two grenades," the statement said, adding that the authorities were negotiating with the hijacker. "The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members," said the statement. On March 19, another passenger plane from Cuba with 31 passengers and six crew members aboard was hijacked by six people and later landed at Key West International Airport in Florida, the United States.
