Los Angeles Kings' coach Andy Murray on Monday was named Canada's head coach at the World Championships starting on April 26 in Finland. Murray, in his fourth season with the National Hockey League ( NHL) club, served as associate coach of the 1998 Canadian Olympic Team and led Team Canada to the gold medal at the 1997 World Championships. "Anytime you have an opportunity to represent your country on the international stage it is both a privilege and an honour," Murray said. Los Angeles was eliminated from playoff contention on Tuesday for the first time during Murray's tenure. Enditem
