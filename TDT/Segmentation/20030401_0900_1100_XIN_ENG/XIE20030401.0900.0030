The United States has been putting pressure on Syria by accusing it of supporting Iraq with military supplies, which diplomatic sources here deemed as a sign of US dissatisfaction with Syria's staunch opposition to the US- led war against Iraq. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said on Friday that shipments of equipment, such as night-vision goggles, had been crossing into Iraq from Syria and that Damascus would be held accountable for such "hostile acts." Syria has dismissed the US charges, calling them an attempt to divert attention from the hardship its forces are facing in Iraq and to cover up "ugly war crimes" against Iraqi civilians. Syria, currently the only Arab member of the UN Security Council, has led Arab opposition to the Iraq war. Before the war started, Syria made great efforts to seek a political and peaceful solution to the Iraqi crisis. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, at an Arab summit, has called on the Arab states not to provide convenience for the US invasion of Iraq. Assad said the Arab world should take a firm stance toward the United States, because, besides Iraq, other Arab countries might also be put on its hit list. Assad said recently that Iraq has the capacity to force the US and British troops out, and called on the Arab world to back Iraqi people in their resistance to coalition forces. Though the US Army has kept a watchful eye on the road between Baghdad and the Syria-Iraq border and continued bombing bridges and vehicles there, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, in disguise, managed to arrive in Damascus via the road, and after meeting with Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, went to Cairo for a foreign ministers' meeting of Arab states. Syria joined the US-led forces in the 1991 Gulf War, but has since improved ties with Iraq. It has voiced strong support for Iraq since the war began 12 days ago and allowed volunteers to cross its border to fight for Iraq. Most of the 400 to 500 people crossing the Syrian border into Iraq are Iraqis, while some of the others are Palestinian and Syrian volunteers, reports said. Washington lists Syria as a state sponsor of "terrorism" for its support of the Lebanese guerrilla group Hizbollah and of pro- Palestinian groups that it hosts. The US motive in carrying out the Iraq war, Assad said, is to control the oil resources and reshape the political situation in the Middle East, and then to control the region and the world. Since he came to office in 2000, Assad has been working to form a Damascus-Baghdad-Teheran strategic security axis, and he deems Iraq as Syria's strategic strength. Analysts said if Iraq failed to get strong support from the Arab world, its current administration might be overthrown by coalition forces. Once that happened, Syria, which sees itself as a champion of Arab nationalism and a rampart against US ally Israel, might be next on Washington's hit list. Therefore, Syria's support to Iraq is based on its own national interests, the analysts added. Enditem
