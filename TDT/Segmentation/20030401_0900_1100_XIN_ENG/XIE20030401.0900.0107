Vietnam will apply the special consumption tax on motorbikes, according to a proposal to the National Assembly by Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung. A tax rate of 50 percent will be applied on luxury motorbikes and 20 percent on popular motorbikes, Vietnam News Agency quoted Hung as saying on Tuesday. The inclusion of motorbikes in the list of commodities subject to the tax was due to Vietnam's pledge to ASEAN Free Trade Area's (AFTA) tariff reduction roadmap and the government's plan to keep the national number of motorbikes to around 13 million in the coming years, Hung said. Vietnam now has 12 million motorbikes. Enditem
