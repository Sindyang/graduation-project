Thailand's overall economy continued to expand in February, but some key sectors began to grow at a slower pace, according to a report released by the Bank of Thailand(BOT) available Tuesday. Atchana Waiquamdee, senior director of the BOT's Domestic Economic Policy Department was quoted as saying that Thailand's private investment still grew 17.5 percent from that of the same month the previous year. Thailand was not eyed as an investment hub by leading economies such as the United States, some European countries and Japan where investors began to pay more attention to business merger than new investment, she noted. Thailand's export, however, expanded significantly with 24.7 percent in February compared with 25 percent in January as the country's import grew 22.5 percent. The industrial output index in February increased 12.8 percent from that of the same month the year before, but declined slightly from the previous month's since orders for luxuries goods such as precious stones and ornaments had dropped. The inflation rate in February stood at 1.9 percent, down from 2.2 percent in January, while the unemployment rate reduced to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent. The BOT official added that the country's tourism had been affected by the US-led war against Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in southeastern Asia. Enditem
