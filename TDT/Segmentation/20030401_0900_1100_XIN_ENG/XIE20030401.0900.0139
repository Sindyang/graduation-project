The car blast outside the British Embassy in Tehran Monday night was a traffic accident caused by slippery road and high speed, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Tuesday. A pickup slammed into the wall near the main entrance to the British Embassy at around 10:15 p.m. local time (1845GMT) Monday and burst into flames, killing the driver but injuring nobody among embassy staff. "The driver had lost control of the car on the slippery road because of rain, and unfortunately lost his life in the accident," Asefi was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency. The incident occurred three days after hundreds of anti-war protesters threw stones at the British Embassy and smashed some windows of its main building. The United States launched a war on Iraq on March 20 to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who has been accused by US President George W. Bush of hiding and developing weapons of mass destruction, an allegation denied by Iraq. Enditem
