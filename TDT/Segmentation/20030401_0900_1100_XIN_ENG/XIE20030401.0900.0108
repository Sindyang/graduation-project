Malaysian Transport Minister, Ling Liong Sik said Tuesday that there had been a three percent drop on a daily average basis in passengers arrivals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) between the period of seven days before and after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was detected in the region. He did not provide a complete figure. He said the government had addressed this matter by taking preventive actions including informing the people of the symptoms of the disease. Ling said that the authorities at both the borders of Thailand and Singapore were cooperating with the Health Ministry to cope with the SARS virus. He was speaking at a press conference after greeting Nepal's assistant minister for culture, tourism and civil aviation, Ravi Bhakti Shresta, and the Royal Nepal Airlines managing director, Mohan Prasad Khanal, at KLIA Tuesday morning. Royal Nepal Airlines, the national carrier of Nepal, flew into KLIA for the first time Tuesday plying Kathmandu -- Singapore -- KLIA -- Kathmandu route utilizing Boeing 757-200 aircraft with a capacity of 16 business class and 174 economy class seats. He said the Malaysian Airline System Bhd (MAS) had taken steps to reduce some routes especially to the effected areas. It has been reported last Sunday that SARS had caused the death of a third victim in Singapore. In its latest update on the SARS situation in Singapore, the ministry said 35 patients had recovered from it and were discharged from the hospital while 53 more were still in the hospital undergoing treatment. Health director-general Mohamad Taha Ariff on March 28 said that Malaysia was free of SARS but the public should exercise caution by getting immediate treatment if they were to experience any symptoms of the disease, Bernama news agency reported.
