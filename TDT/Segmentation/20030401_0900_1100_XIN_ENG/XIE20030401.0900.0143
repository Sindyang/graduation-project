British retailers suffered the first significant year-on-year fall in sales volumes for four years in March, according to the monthly report of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Tuesday. The organization said in its monthly Distributive Trade Survey conducted up to March 19, the day before the US-led war on Iraq began, that only 28 percent of firms said sales were up on March last year, while 41 percent said they were down. The difference between firms reporting sales up and those reporting sales down was minus 13, this is the first significant fall since January 1999 which saw minus 9 and the lowest balance since July 1992 when a minus 15 was recorded. The CBI said this was the lowest balance since July 1992, when the British economy was just coming out of its last recession. British retailers had expected the figures for March to show an improvement on the February performance but their hopes were dashed for the sixth survey in a row. The CBI said the outlook remains downbeat with sales expected to remain unchanged in the year to April, the weakest expectations for eight years. The survey found that demand weakened across all retail sectors except hardware, china and DIY where significant sales growth were reported. Stocks have also run down to their lowest level in nearly two years as retailers cut their orders with suppliers for the third successive survey. Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic adviser, said that "sales growth has stalled in almost every retail sector." "These results confirm our fears that consumer confidence has been affected by uncertainties surrounding the war in Iraq, the impending tax rises and worries about the housing market," he added. "Retailers have already done their best to prop up consumer confidence by cutting prices and heavy discounting. They will be hoping that the Budget does nothing further to keep people away from the shops," McCafferty said. Motor traders' sales fell sharply as sales of new cars declined. The Distributive Trades Survey covers more than 20,000 outlets of firms responsible for 40 percent of employment in retailing. Enditem
