Foreign invested enterprises (FIEs) in Vietnam will enjoy tax exemptions when transferring profits out of the country, according to a draft of the National Assembly. The draft was proposed by the Finance Ministry and the Planning and Investment Ministry. Meanwhile, the corporate income tax applied on FIEs will also be revised to 28 percent once the preferential tax treatment period expires. Tax on profit transfer out of Vietnam has so far ranged between 3 percent and 7 percent. The Planning and Investment Ministry said it was working to include more decentralization and transparency in the bidding procedures. A decree on amendment of bidding regulations is also in the making. It is drafted to prevent bidders from proposing dumping prices and emphasize their responsibility. Enditem
