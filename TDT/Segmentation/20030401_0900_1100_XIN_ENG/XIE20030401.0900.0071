ABOARD USS KITTY HAWK AIRCRAFT CARRIER (GULF), April 1 (Xinhua) -- An S-3B Viking aboard the USS Constellation veered off the flight deck Tuesday morning after making an arrested landing, said a press release from the US Naval Forces Central Command based in the Fifth Fleet. Shortly after touching down on deck, the S-3B malfunctioned while taxiing on the carrier's flight deck and slid to the left side of the deck, the press release said. The plane went over the side, hit flight deck safety netting and went into the water, but ejected the two pilots onboard into the water, it said. A HS-2 helicopter, performing search and rescue operations for the flight cycle, arrived on scene immediately. Both pilots were rescued by a Search and Rescue swimmer and transported to Constellation, it added. No personnel on the flight deck was injured and the cause of the S-3B malfunction was under investigation, the release added. The S-3B Viking performs multiple missions, including tanking support, anti-submarine warfare, electronic support measures and precision strike. The USS Constellation is currently deployed in the northern Gulf. Enditem
