Fourteen people were killed, 13 injured and five kidnapped on Monday when armed men attacked a remote village in Kashmore in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province. A report of the Daily Times newspaper reaching here on Tuesday quoted police sources as saying that the attack was caused by a tribal feud between the Bugti and Mazari tribes. It added that around 35 men with automatic weapons, who allegedly belong to the Bugti tribe, raided the village where most locals belong to the Mazari tribe, and opened fire at various places including a police station. Local police have arrested some people related to the incident and are pushing the two rival tribes to hand over more suspects, said the report. Enditem
