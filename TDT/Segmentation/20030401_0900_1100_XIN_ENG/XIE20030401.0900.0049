An interim government led by Abel Goubma has been set up in the Central African Republic (CAR), according to a report from Bangui, capital of CAR, on Tuesday. The cabinet, which is made up of 28 ministers, includes some coup leaders and heads of parties. Goubma, a retired professor of medicine, was appointed as the prime minister in March by Francois Bozize, who proclaimed himself president of CAR after his forces seized the capital city. Goumba was the leader of the Patriotic Front for Progress, a major opposition party in the country and a strong critic of former president Ange-Felix Patasse, who remains in exile in Cameroon. In March, forces loyal to Bozize, the former army chief of the country, drove into Bangui, occupied the airport and Patasse's residence before taking over the whole city. Patasse was attending a summit meeting in Niger when the incident took place, and later, he was forced to fly to Cameroon after his plane was shot at over Bangui airport. Enditem
