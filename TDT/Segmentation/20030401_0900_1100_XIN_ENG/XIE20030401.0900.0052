Former Zambian president and veteran African politician Kenneth Kaunda has condemned the US-led war in Iraq as "savage" and "evil", major Zambian newspaper The Post said Tuesday. In a telephone interview from Boston University in the United States, Kaunda said he had decided to join the worldwide anti-war demonstrations because US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are exposing American and British people to a great danger. "It is a savage war because people being bombed are innocent children, women, men and the aged," Kaunda said. "It is not only the Iraqis who are being murdered...What about those young men in uniform from the US and British armies who are losing their lives through the barrel of the gun?' He disclosed that while in London recently, he joined over 2 million British people, among them family members of soldiers, in demonstration against the Iraqi war. Noting the majority of the American people are opposed to the war, Kaunda asked the Zambians not to demonizing the American and British people" because they are not in support of this savage war. " Kaunda dismissed the search for weapons of mass destruction as the reason behind the war against Iraq. "All they want is to recolonize Iraq so that they can get free oil," he said. Enditem
