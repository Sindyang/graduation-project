Primitive microbes found in rocks covered by the sea 1.4 billion years ago are providing support for the theory that life may have originated in a type of "underwater chimney", Chinese scientists said recently. The "geological evidence" found on rocks near the Great Wall in northeast China challenges the prevailing theory that evolution depended exclusively on sunlight, said Li Jianghai, professor with the earth and space institute attached to the elite Beijing University. The fossilized microbes, only microns in size, appeared bulbiform or filiform under an electronic microscope. They had been "capable of surviving in extreme conditions devoid of sunlight and oxygen, but with extreme temperatures and pressure." The microbes obtained energy and nutrients through the conversion of toxic gas, usually sulfured hydrogen, emitted from " black smoke-emitting chimneys" and was fatal to common life, according to Li. The international scientific circle has long studied the mystery of the origin of life: how primitive organisms survived the earliest harsh climates, a time when there was little oxygen in the earth's atmosphere and no ozone shield sheltering terrestrial life and shallow water organisms from the sun's lethal ultraviolet radiation. The finding at the foot of the Great Wall has supported the theory that deep-sea floors are the source of the earliest life on earth. (more)
