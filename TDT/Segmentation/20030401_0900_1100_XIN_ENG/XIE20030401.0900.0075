Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir is due to arrive here Wednesday on his one-day state visit to Kenya, the Sudanese embassy in Nairobi disclosed Tuesday. During his stay, Al-Bashir is expected to meet his Kenyan counterpart Mwai Kibaki and discuss with him wide range of issues including the ongoing Sudanese peace talks, which sponsored by the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and held in Kenya's capital Nairobi. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), based in southern Sudan, has been fighting for more autonomy from the central government in Khartoum. The conflict between the government and rebels, combined with disease and famine, has taken around 2 million lives since 1983. Last July, the Sudanese government and the SPLA began peace talks under the auspices of IGAD, a six-member regional group in East Africa, which groups of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda. Kenya is the current chairman of the IGAD ministerial sub-committee on the Sudan. Al-Bashir will be the first head of state to visit Kenya since President Kibaki assumed power at the end of last year. Enditem
