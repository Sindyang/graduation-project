Participants of the ongoing four- day Pesticide Action Network Asia and the Pacific (PAN AP) Congress Tuesday called on the US-led coalition to stop its war against Iraq, saying the action is a crime against humanity. The participants made their common statement which was read by Dr. Irene Fernandez, founder and director of a women's organization fighting for the rights of workers in Malaysia and chairman of the steering committee of PAN AP, the Philippines News Agency reported. Fernandez said the military action against Iraq "is an unjust, immoral and illegitimate war" that is causing the destruction of lives, properties and the environment. The movement leaders also called on United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to immediately convene the UN General Assembly. "We call for the immediate stoppage of the war, withdrawal of all US troops and the UN to lead to the restoration of the legitimate rights and needs of the people of Iraq," she said. Fernandez said their group supports all peace-loving people in relentlessly resisting "this heinous crime against humanity, the violence, the waste and the blasphemy against genuine democracy and human rights." The congress, which opened Tuesday in Manila, is being participated in by more than 120 people from Asia and the Pacific, mostly movement leaders from the peasant, women, indigenous, and fisheries and agricultural workers' organizations.
