Experts said the finding was significant to the understanding of life's origin and to the exploration of exotic life forms on other planets. "It revealed good prospects for the search for lower life forms in places other than on earth," Li said. "We have a lot of work to do in the coming months, including a profound field survey and the examination of characteristics and types of the fossilized microbes," Li noted, adding that comparative research was also being considered to study the relationship between relevant records and microorganisms currently living in hydrothermal vent locations in the ocean. Since microbe-type organisms were able to survive without sunlight and oxygen on ancient earth, it is also possible to find similar lower life forms or fossils thereof on other planets. The research of Li's international counterparts have confirmed the possibility of finding similar organisms on Mars and Jupiter, both of which have an environment similar to that of the prmitive earth, according to Li The researchers discovered a large number of live microorganisms and their fossils near hydrogen-spewing "chimneys" on the ocean floor, and laboratory testing proved they possessed the most primitive genome on earth.
