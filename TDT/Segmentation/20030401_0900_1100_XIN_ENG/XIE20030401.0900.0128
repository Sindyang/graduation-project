French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin Tuesday warned against displays of anti-Americanism in protests against the Iraq war. "It is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable," Raffarin said while addressing the parliament. The French government was also worried that the frequent protests against the ongoing Iraq war would become a forum for anti-Semitism, the prime minister said. The government would not tolerate any signs of "racist, anti- Semitic or xenophobic acts," he added. France had been struggling to smooth relations with the United States due to its firm opposition to the US-led military campaign against Iraq. Raffarin said on Monday that despite the opposition, France was not the US' enemy. Enditem
