Japan will continue to fulfill its loans and other economic obligations to Malaysia, Japanese Ambassador to Malaysia Masaki Konishi said here Tuesday. "We will also continue with our economic cooperation in Malaysia and expect to maintain an upward trend in our investment in Malaysia in the long term," Konishi was quoted as saying by the national news agency Bernama after a presentation ceremony here for 33 Malaysian students who have been awarded Japanese government scholarships. Konishi said Japan might be facing an economic downturn currently, but it will continue to look at increasing its investment in Malaysia in the future. In 2002, Japan was Malaysia's third largest trading partner and its investments in Malaysia amounted to RM570 million in 109 approved projects. In terms of capital investment, Japan ranked the second largest investor in Malaysia after the United States in the year 2001. Investments were mainly in electrical and electronics products, transport equipment, basic metal products, chemicals and chemical products, rubber products, petroleum products and fabricated metal products. Last week, the Bank of Japan downgraded its assessment of the Japanese economy, citing the weak outlook for the US economy. It was reported that an export slowdown was threatening to derail recovery in the world's second largest economy, mainly due to a decline in US consumer demand for Japanese products such as cars and electronic goods.
