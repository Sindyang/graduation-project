Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and visiting former Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday discussed the need for boosting bilateral trust in dealing with political issues as well as energy projects, Kyodo News reported. "I told Yeltsin we should map out activities through which we can develop trust and sign a bilateral post-World War II peace treaty," Koizumi was quoted. The premier also said after the meeting at his office they discussed the need for negotiating the issues in line with bilateral documents including the 1993 Tokyo Declaration, which acknowledges the territorial dispute between Japan and Russia and commits the two countries to working out a peace treaty. During their meeting, Koizumi and Yeltsin talked about a plan to construct crude oil pipelines in Siberia and transport natural gas to Japan from Sakhalin, Kyodo said. Yeltsin said he and Koizumi also discussed bilateral cooperation in various sectors such as politics, culture, defense and industry. Enditem
