Malaysia has recorded a trade surplus of 4.9 billion ringgit in February 2003, compared with 6.3 billion ringgit in the previous month, the national news agency Bernama reported Monday. The report, quoting the preliminary release from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), said that this was the 64th consecutive month of trade surplus recorded by the country since November 1997. Total export of goods for the month amounted to 25.9 billion ringgit, a decline of 14.8 percent from January 2003 while total imports totaled 21.0 billion ringgit (declined by 13.1 percent from January). MITI said that traditionally the volume of trade has been relatively low in February, with some reduced number of working days due to festivities. Major exports in February include electrical and electronic (E&amp; E) products with 13.1 billion ringgit worth of exports, chemical and chemical products (1.5 billion ringgit), crude petroleum (1.4 billion), palm oil (1.3 billion), liquefied natural gas (1.1 billion) and machinery, appliances and parts (838.9 million). Major export destinations were ASEAN countries, the United States, the European Union (EU), Japan, China's mainland and Hong Kong, with a combined contribution of 79.5 percent to Malaysia's total exports. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) was Malaysia's largest export market in February, accounting for 26.6 percent of Malaysia's total exports in that month with a value of 6.9 billion ringgit as compared with 8.1 billion in January. Exports to the United States declined by 22.1 percent to 3.9 billion ringgit in February, mainly due to lower exports of E&amp;E products, textiles and clothing, wood products and chemicals and chemical products. Exports to the European Union stood at 3.2 billion ringgit with the Netherlands accounting for the bulk of it with 894 million worth of exports. At the same time, total imports in February declined by 13.1 percent to 21 billion ringgit compared with 24.1 billion in the previous month with major sources of imports from the 10-member ASEAN (5 billion), Japan (4 billion), the United States (3.2 billion), China (1.4 billion), South Korea (970.8 million), Germany (969.6 million) and China's Taiwan (912.4 million). There were some declines in imports by end use for the three main categories, including intermediate goods to 15.3 billion ringgit (a decline of 11.9 percent), capital goods to 2.9 billion (a decline of 11.2 percent) and consumption goods to 1.2 billion ( a decline of 24.6 percent). Major imports in February comprised E&amp;E products (10 billion ringgit); machinery, appliances and parts (1.71 billion); chemical and chemical products (1.67 billion); iron and steel products (784. 6 million); manufactures of metal (766.6 million); transport equipment (746.9 million); refined petroleum products (687.5 million), optical and scientific petroleum (648.6 million) and crude petroleum (526.9 million).
