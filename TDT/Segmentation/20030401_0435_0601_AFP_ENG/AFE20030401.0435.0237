Italy on Tuesday renewed its attack on plans by four European Union countries including France and Germany to hold a special defence summit, saying it should be open to all 15 EU members. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he would formally ask the Greek presidency of the European Union on Tuesday to enlarge the mini-summit to include all 15 member states. "The idea of a summit at the end of April is a good thing, among the 15, many of whom have the same ideas about these issues. But it must be something for all 15," Frattini told the daily La Repubblica in an interview. "The European Council meeting on March 20, the documents of the Convention are all of the same mind about strengthening European defence," he said. Italy is among several EU member states to criticise the summit, set to include Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg. The April 29 summit has revived talk of a "two-tiered" EU at a time when the continent is badly fractured over Iraq. If no one else attends, the summit will gather EU's strongest opponents of the US-led war on Iraq and omit backers of the US-led campaign to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein -- Britain, Denmark, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. clr-db/yad EU-summit-military-Italy
