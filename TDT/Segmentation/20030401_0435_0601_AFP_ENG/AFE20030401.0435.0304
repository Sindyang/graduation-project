Vandals have defaced one of the biggest British war cemeteries in northern France with graffiti condemning the US-British invasion of Iraq, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said Monday. Insults aimed at British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush were sprayed in red paint over a monument to Britain's dead from World War I and discovered by a gardener last Thursday. "It was removed by the afternoon but not before a couple of coach loads (of visitors) had been through and seen it. We are pretty hacked off and I am pleased to say the French authorities are too," said Tim Reeves, the CWGC's representative in France. The words "Rosbifs (British) go home! Saddam Hussein will win and spill your blood" were painted in French over the base of the cemetery's main monument -- an obelisk topped by a cross. On one side was a swastika and the words "Death to the yankees." Some 11,000 British dead are buried at Etaples, which lies on the Channel coast around 15 miles (24 kilometres) south of Boulogne. It was the site of several hospitals during World War I. A judicial enquiry has been opened. hs/ds Iraq-war-France-Britain
