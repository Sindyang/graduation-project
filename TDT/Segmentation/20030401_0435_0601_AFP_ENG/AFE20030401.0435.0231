Sweden has reported its first probable case of a deadly respiratory virus, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control said on Tuesday. "We now have a probable case" of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Hans Blystad, senior medical epidimiologist at SMI told AFP. A man is being treated in isolation at a non-disclosed hospital in Sweden after recently returning home from Beijing, is the first Swedish case to be reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), Blystad said. "We are awaiting the results of a chest x-ray, which could take two to three days," Blystad said. Seven earlier suspected cases of SARS in Sweden have all been dismissed, Blystad said. Suspected cases involve anyone with a fever and cough who has recently visited SARS-afflicted areas; probable cases carry a higher degree of likelihood and must be reported to WHO, Blystad said. The mystery virus erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November and has spread worldwide, mostly by airline passengers, killing more than 60 people. It manifests itself as a form of pneumonia and is spread through direct close contact with an infected person. The Swedish foreign ministry and institute last week advised against travel to SARS-afflicted areas. po/jh/yad Health-pneumonia-Sweden
