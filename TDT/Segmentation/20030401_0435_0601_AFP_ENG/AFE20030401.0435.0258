Hong Kong's government is under fire for its handling of the pneumonia crisis, with some critics saying fear of offending the Chinese government has hampered efforts to contain the health scare. Democratic Party legislator Li Wah-ming said despite the closing of schools and the isolation of a 33-storey residential complex in the territory, efforts to contain the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been "too little, too late." "I would say they overlooked the importance of this issue and that may be because of political reasons concerning the mainland," he said. "Unfortunately the Chinese government has handled this issue with denial and Hong Kong has been more concerned about offending China than it has been in pushing the mainland to get the information needed to stop this disease." Neighboring China has been the country worst hit by the mysterious SARS virus, with at least 34 dying from the disease from an estimated 800 infections since it first appeared there in November. But the Chinese authorities have been strongly criticised around the world for failing to reveal the extent of the outbreak and for preventing World Health Organisation (WHO) officials from visiting affected areas in Guangdong province across the border from Hong Kong. SARS is believed to have been brought to Hong Kong from Guangdong in early March by a doctor who later succumbed to the disease. It has now spread to at least another 15 countries, infecting some 1,700 people and and killing at least 62. The death toll in Hong Kong rose to 15 Monday with another 610 people believed infected, prompting authorities to order a 264-unit block of a housing complex isolated until midnight April 9. The measure was taken after 185 residents in the block came down with the flu-like symptoms of SARS, including 64 who were diagnosed on Monday. But a health department spokeswoman told AFP Tuesday there were only some 240 residents in 108 units when the quarantine order was put in place, and that authorities had little information on the whereabouts of tenants from another 156 units who have reportedly fled. Li Wah-ming said the number of missing tenants meant the quarantining effort would likely fail, adding that more assertive action should have been taken much earlier in the epidemic. "The authorities have reacted very slowly. They've given the impression they are doing what is needed, but clearly that has not been the case," he said. Democratic Party colleague Martin Lee said he was loathe to criticise the government during "such a serious crisis," but he said the government should probably have taken tougher action much earlier. "Some people certainly believe we have lost a lot of precious time, and certainly doctors are saying we should have acted very much faster," he said. "If we look at the situation in Singapore, for example, they have been very efficient." Singapore on Tuesday quarantined the country's men's and women's rugby teams on their return from the Hong Kong Sevens tournament as part of a series of tough measures aimed at containing SARS. Singapore has also put more than 800 households under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days and placed 600,000 school children on forced vacation until April 6 in response to just four SARS related deaths and 92 suspected infections. hw/pch Health-pneumonia-Hongkong
