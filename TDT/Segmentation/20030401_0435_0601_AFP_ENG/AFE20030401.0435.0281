A special court has summoned India's deputy premier L.K. Advani and six top Hindu nationalist leaders in connection with the 1992 razing of a mosque that sparked bloody riots, a report said Tuesday. The Press Trust of India (PTI) said besides Advani, Human Resources Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, former cabinet sports minister Uma Bharti and Ashok Singhal, president of the hardline Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council) are under orders to appear before the court on April 16. The summons were issued Monday and were mailed to the seven leaders. Advani, Singhal, Bharti and several others have been named in police reports as encouraging a frenzied mob of several thousand Hindu zealots who tore down the Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. Hindus claim it was the birthplace of their god Ram and a temple had existed there before the mosque. They claimed they wanted to rebuild a temple. The ensuing religious bloodbath left more than 2,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless across India. Officials told PTI that the special court, which has sweeping powers, can issue arrest warrants if the seven do not obey the summons and participate in the long-drawn out criminal trial of the demolition of the mosque. The summons came a day after the Supreme Court booted out a plea by the Hindu nationalist government to lift a ban on worship near the Babri mosque rubble, which is claimed by both Hindus and Muslims. The order humiliated Advani's Hindu nationalist BJP party, which heads the coalition government, and had been hoping to reap political benefit by reopening the sealed site to Hindu worshippers. The government last month asked the court to lift its ban on any religious activity on 67 acres (27.11 hectares) of land near the demolished mosque in the town of Ayodhya, 434 miles (700 kilometres) south of Delhi. But the court said the government's request was rejected "to maintain communal harmony" at the site, which is heavily barricaded and barred to civilians. It said its earlier order banning all religious activity on the site would continue until the dispute over the ownership of the land was settled by a court dealing with it in the northern city of Allahabad. pc/an/sdm India-temple
