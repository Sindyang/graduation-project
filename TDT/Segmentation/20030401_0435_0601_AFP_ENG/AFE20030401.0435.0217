The deadly outbreak of viral pneumonia is casting a dark cloud over Asian economies, with growth rates this year likely to be slashed by up to 1.5 percentage points, an investment bank said Tuesday. "We are of the view that economic growth will slow in Asia as a result of the decline in the two pillars of Asia's economies -- tourism and private consumption," BNP Paribas Peregrine said in a report. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, spread to Hong Kong and onwards to other parts of the world, killing at least 60 people so far. The virus has so far claimed 15 lives in Hong Kong and infected 610, with tourism and aviation industries throughout Asia suffering as travellers choose to stay home. "The SARS epidemic will cast a long dry spell on tourism and its associated industries. We expect the airline, hotel, trade, retail and property sectors to be adversely affected by the pneumonia problem," BNP Paribas Peregrine said. However, some sectors such as supermarkets, newspapers and television stations would benefit from the public preference to stay home, it added. The cuts to economic growth forecasts for the region have also been made as it becomes clear the US-led war in Iraq will last longer than initially expected. This is a bigger factor than SARS in some countries such as South Korea where BNP Paribas has cut its growth forecast to 4.0 percent from 5.1 percent. But for much of Asia, the virus is arguably a bigger problem, the report said. The biggest growth forecast cut is for Singapore, which is heavily reliant on tourism. Growth this year is now seen at 2.5 percent, down from 4.0 percent. Hong Kong's expected growth has been cut to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent, Taiwan to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and Malaysia to 4.0 percent from 4.7 percent. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Thailand's growth is seen easing to 3.5 percent from 4.0 percent forecast earlier, Indonesia is seen falling to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and the Philippines is is estimated at 3.0 percent, down from 3.5 percent. BNP Paribas Peregrine is maintaining its 7.4 percent growth forecast for China, which is less dependent on tourism, but said the estimate could be cut by 0.2 to 1.0 percentage points if the situation worsens. bro/dv Health-pneumonia-Asia-economy
