A 72-year-old man who was recently in Vietnam was on Tuesday confirmed as the first German to have contracted a virulent respiratory illness that has killed scores of people around the world. The man, who became the fourth case in Germany after three Singaporeans were diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Frankfurt earlier this month, was being treated in a clinic in Hemer in western Germany. The patient, who had recently travelled to Vietnam, has been under treatment since Friday and his doctor said his condition was improving. SARS erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, spread to Hong Kong and onwards to over a dozen other countries, and has killed more than 60 people so far. On Monday, doctors in the southern state of Bavaria said they were treating a child of one and a 60-year-old man showing the disease's flu-like symptoms. Over the weekend medical authorities said they were carrying out tests to try to discover whether a man from the southwest city of Mannheim also had the condition. A Singaporean doctor who had treated a SARS patient, the doctor's wife and his mother-in-law, all of whom were transiting through Frankfurt airport, were earlier this month reported to be the first cases of the disease in Europe. Their condition has since improved, according to doctors. loc/ds Health-pneumonia-Germany
