The death toll from a powerful gas explosion in a Chinese coal mine had risen to 25 Tuesday, while one survivor had been found after being buried alive for more than a day, officials said. A total of 45 people were inside the Mengjiagou mine, near Fushun city in northeastern Liaoning province, when the blast occurred on Sunday, according to the officials. As of late Tuesday, the number of confirmed deaths had risen to 25, while there were 20 survivors, an official at the State Burau of Supervising Coalmine Safety told AFP. Rescue workers late Monday found one coal miner who had been trapped in the mine for more than 24 hours. He is now hospitalized and out of danger, according to a local official. Chinese mines have an appalling safety record, and the number of mining deaths last year reached 14,924, according to the State Administration of Work Safety. ph/sai/sdm China-mine
