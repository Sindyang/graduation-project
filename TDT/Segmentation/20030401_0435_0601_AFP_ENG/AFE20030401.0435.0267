China insisted Tuesday it has controlled the spread of a deadly pneumonia in the country, and defended itself against growing international criticism that its slow actions led to a global outbreak. "The Chinese government has all along adopted a very responsible attitude on this issue," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said, adding that the government has recently released information about cases in China. "We know the situation we're in is a safe one." He suggested that the international community may be overreacting to the outbreak of the atypical pneumonia, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which has killed more than 60 people and infected around 1,600 worldwide. "We should follow scientific principles," Liu said. "We have nothing to hide. The Chinese government will continue to release relevant data and information." Liu said no cases had been discovered in parts of China other than southern Guangdong province, Beijing and northern Shanxi province. "So far the disease has been under effective control. Most patients have recovered and have left hospital," Liu told reporters at a regular briefing. "It has not been spread to other places. Besides Guangdong, Beijing and Shanxi, we have not found cases in other parts of China." China has been the country worst hit by the mysterious virus, which has left 34 dead in the country and more than 800 infected in Guangdong, Shanxi and Beijing. Liu, however, said more updated figures would soon be released. He did not explain what the new data would show. But he insisted that China was a safe place to visit despite cancellations of various events, including the first ever concerts in China of the Rolling Stones, and travel warnings by the US government. "Regardless of whether it's Chinese citizens living in China or foreigners paying business or other trips to China, they will be safe," Liu said. International health experts suspect the pneumonia originated in China, which has come under fire for providing little information about the epidemic, which expedited its spread. cs/sai/th Health-pneumonia-China-control
