A senior Palestinian minister on Tuesday accused Israel of stalling an internationally drafted peace plan after Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said in Washington the Palestinians had first to fight "terrorism." Shalom stressed after a meeting with US President George W. Bush that "there cannot be two parallel paths: the war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night. "The end of terrorism constitutes the central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," he told Israeli radio. He was reiterating the constant argument by Israeli Minister Ariel Sharon that the Jewish state will not "negotiate under fire." Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat slammed Shalom's remarks. "The statement by Shalom in the White House is an Israeli rejection of the roadmap," he said, referring to the peace plan based on a Bush speech last June, and drawn up in collaboration with European Union, Russian and United Nations diplomats. "Israel is working to thwart any efforts to try to bring the peace process back on track. Shalom is challenging the White House and creating the basis for a continuing rejection of the roadmap," he said. "Israel talks in English of peace but gives orders in Hebrew to attack," he said. Erakat also had tough words on a US State Department report on human rights, which accused the Palestinians of serious rights violations while saying the Israelis had some problems with their large Arab minority. "There is no talk of the highest kind of terrorism, which is occupation, controlling people under the threat of weapons. What we are facing under Israeli occupation after 35 years is the highest kind of terrorism and violation of human rights. The reports doesn't mention these things," he said. The State Department's annual rights report said members of the Palestinian security forces and Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took part in anti-Israel violence and terrorist attacks. It said that while there was no proof of official approval of such acts, some endorsed the use of violence in principle in a violation of commitments to halt attacks on Israelis. sa-jh/kir Mideast-Palestinian-US-Israel
