Swedish pension funds applying ethical criteria in their investment are under the proverbial gun after a recent report alleged that a number of them invest in companies that produce war materiel. "It's false advertising. They label themselves as ethical funds and at the same time invest in some of the world's largest war materiel producers," charged Rolf Lindahl, a researcher at the non-profit lobby group Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society which wrote the report. It cited as an example Sweden's leading "ethical funds" manager Banco: this company's Ethical Swedish Fund Pension topped the list of 'unethicals' with 9.3 percent of its holdings in the war industry. Companies such as Boeing, BAE Systems, General Dynamics and Raytheon, which manufacture many of the fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, missiles and bombs currently seeing action in the US-led war against Iraq, are among those found on the investment list of many Swedish funds. But, argued Banco, its ethical fund was singled out in the report for its holdings in Swedish stock market heavyweights Volvo and Ericsson, which are known primarily for their trucks and mobile phones -- not their engines and radar equipment used in tanks and jet fighters. Banco ethics analyst Tonika Hirdman said Banco's definition of "ethical fund" means that more than 95 percent of a company's turnover must be derived from industries other than the weapons, alcohol or tobacco industries. "One percent of Ericsson's sales are, according to our definition, to be classified as weapons-related due to their radar equipment" used in jet fighters, Hirdman told AFP, saying that was well below the five percent limit and rejecting the report as "misleading" and "unscientific". Lindahl dismissed Banco's argument. "It doesn't matter if it's only one percent, it's one percent of a very large civilian company that has large war materiel production," he insisted. The report also found that 26 of the 30 most popular premium pension funds -- into which all working-age Swedes place the 2.5 percent of income that they can freely invest to supplement the state pension -- also had holdings in war materiel companies. One of those is the Seventh AP Fund, the state-run default fund for Swedes who choose not to place that money themselves which manages funds for more than two million Swedes. Six percent of the Seventh AP Fund's holdings are in "war shares". But while daily newspapers have highlighted the issue with splashy headlines since the start of the war against Iraq -- Svenska Dagbladet recently headlined "Millions of Swedes Have Invested in War Industry" -- most Swedes do not seem too bothered by the revelations. The expected outrage and indignation, in this very politically-correct country, just are not there. This is despite the fact that Swedish anti-war sentiment is at its highest since the Vietnam War and opinion polls show an overwhelming majority are opposed to the US-led military action in Iraq. Neither Banco nor the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society had registered any complaints or comments from Swedes in spite of the heavy media attention. Equally ambivalent do Swedes appear to be over reports that Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson, a staunch opponent of the war which he calls "a violation of international law", owns war shares through funds in his private investment portfolio. As do Finance Minister Bosse Ringholm, Industry Minister Leif Pagrotsky, Defense Minister Leni Bjoerklund and Agriculture Minister Ann-Christin Nykvist. The lack of indignation may be due to a slow erosion of opposition to the Iraq war. Two polls published last week showed opposition had fallen since the start of the war, from 81 to 68 percent in one survey and from 68 to 62 percent in the other. The Swedish Consumer Agency has however reacted angrily to the ethical funds' investments and says it plans to look into the issue. "It's not very ethical. Few consider a company that manufactures war materiel ethical," financial division manager Peter Knutsson said. po/jh/hd Iraq-war-Sweden-economy-funds-pensions-ethics
