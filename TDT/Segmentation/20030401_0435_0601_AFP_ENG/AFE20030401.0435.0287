Singapore share prices closed 1.16 percent higher Tuesday after recent sharp falls as investors looked to amass bargain stocks, but worries of the protracted war in Iraq remained, dealers said. The Straits Times Index gained 14.76 points to 1,282.58, off its intraday high of 1,292.24 as profit-taking set in, and All-Singapore Equities index rose 3.51 points to 344.37. "Overall, the market is looking good. Although volume has not been high, movements have been rather slow," a dealer at a local brokerage said. "It is probably a 'slow and steady' uptrend, rather than one of those strong spikes," the dealer said. Volume traded totalled 295.16 million shares worth 412.28 million Singapore dollars (234.25 million US), up from 275.21 million shares worth 433.36 million dollars on Monday. There were 145 rising issues, 77 decliners and 342 issues were even. Singapore Telecommunications was three cents higher at 1.37 after announcing Monday it planned to list its postal unit SingPost. Bank stocks also rebounded after posting sharp falls on Monday, led by United Overseas Bank which added 30 cents to 10.60, DBS was five cents up at 9.25 but Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. dropped five cents to 9.40. Singapore Airlines was 10 cents up at 8.85, electronic contract manufacturer Venture Corp. also rose by the same amount to 14.10 and Creative Technology was 40 cents firmer at 11.10. bh/dv Stocks-Singapore
