All sides in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war agreed Tuesday, at the final session of talks aimed at ending the country's four-year conflict, to set up a transition government to lead to the first democratic elections in 40 years. Some 360 delegates attending the final session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue adopted by acclamation agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year, providing for a two-year transition government culminating in the DRC's first democratic elections since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. They also adopted a constitution, which was agreed on March 6. str/jhe/hn/kdz DRCongo-talks
