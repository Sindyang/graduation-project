The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece are to discuss the divided island of Cyprus on April 8, on the sidelines of a summit of Balkan countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday. Turkey will not give up its efforts to end the long-running division of Cyprus just because its rival Cypriot Greek and Turkish communities failed last month to agree on a United Nations plan to reunite the Mediterranean island, Erdogan told parliamentarians from his ruling Justice and Development Party. "We want to make new openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan said. He added that Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway Turkish state in the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new steps" ahead of the planned Belgrade meeting. "I hope our efforts will make a positive contribution the Cyprus problem," Erdogan added. In Athens, a source at the diplomatic office of Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis confirmed that Turkey had proposed a meeting on the Cyprus question, but said it was not yet certain that it would take place. "There has been a proposal on the Turkish side and we view it favourably. But it is not 100-percent sure and we haven't officially confirmed it yet," the source told AFP. The Turkish press has recently reported that Ankara was planning to look for a Cyprus solution outside the United Nations framework, but there has so far been no official confirmation of that. A last-ditch effort by the United Nations to reunify the island failed earlier this month when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash rejected the UN blueprint, to which the Greek Cypriots also had objections. The plan was largely regarded as the final chance to resolve the island's division before the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot side joins the European Union next year. The EU has said that if there is no reunification deal, it will admit only the Greek Cypriots. Cyprus has been divided since July 1974 when Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in reponse to a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece. han/fc/ds Cyprus-Turkey-Greece
