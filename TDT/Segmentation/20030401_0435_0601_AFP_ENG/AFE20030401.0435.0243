A Russian doctor known here for his work in war zones said Tuesday he would travel to Geneva and New York in an effort to organize a "green corridor" to evacuate dozens of Iraqi children injured during the US-led war against Iraq. "We are not asking for anything permanent. All we ask for is that the Americans agree that they do not bomb certain roads for a certain stretch of time," Leonid Roshal told reporters. He said he mentioned the plan to President Vladimir Putin and that the Russian leader agreed with the idea. "I myself asked Putin about this and he said that he supported it," Roshal told reporters. "Who would not want to help children?" Roshal said that he was still waiting for a formal response from Washington and that the Iraqi ambassador to Russia approved of the plan. He said that the International Committee of the Red Cross -- which would have to play a key role in any such evacuation -- has been hesitant. "The Red Cross was very cautious and told me it may be too early to review this question," Roshal said without going into further details. Roshal has worked in many war zones of the former Soviet Union and most recently assisted both civilians and Chechen guerrillas involved in October's three-day Moscow theater hostage standoff in which at least 129 civilians died. He was awarded with a medal for his efforts by Putin earlier this year. zak/hm/yad Iraq-war-Russia-children
