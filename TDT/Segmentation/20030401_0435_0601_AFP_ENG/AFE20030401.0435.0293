Stock markets stabilised in Asia and Europe on Tuesday, while the dollar bounced back slightly and oil prices slipped as traders perked up following recent gloom over the war in Iraq. However with little visible progress made by US and British troops fighting towards Baghdad, the improved sentiment was caused mainly by either bargain hunting or a series of individual local factors unconnected to the Gulf. The still-volatile situation in Iraq was emphasised overnight as US troops, on alert for suicide bombings, shot dead seven women and children travelling in a vehicle at a checkpoint in the centre of the country. "It's a see-saw market," said analyst Henk Potts of Barclays Stockbrokers. "The market is trading very much on the headlines," he said, explaining that most gains had been made by dealers seeking to exploit the volatility. "There is interest in the market, in buying back some of the sold positions," he said, while adding that the short-term outlook remained "on the down side". On European markets, the British FTSE 100 index edged up 0.3 percent to 3,623.0 points, the German DAX 30 slipped 0.5 percent to 2,411.5 points and the French CAC 40 was unchanged at 2,618.6 points in early trading. The pause for breath had begun in Asia, despite continued worries over the economic impact of the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. Japanese shares ended the day slightly higher after buying linked to the start of the new Japanese financial year. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 closed up 14.01 points or 0.18 percent at 7,986.72. South Korea's composite index closed up 0.53 percent at 538.56, but Hong Kong prices closed 0.44 percent lower at 8,596.89 due to fears about the SARS virus. Analysts said the Asian exchanges remained at the mercy of events in the Gulf. "If overseas stock markets continue to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local stock market will also continue to be pressured," said Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Hinode Securities. The dollar also showed signs of stabilising after heavy losses, with some dealers taking the view that recent pessimism over Iraq might have been overdone. The euro dipped to 1.0896 dollars from 1.0933 late on Monday in New York, while the dollar rose to 118.04 yen from 117.95. Michael Klawitter, economist at the German bank WestLB, said that the steadier tone of the dollar was not surprising given the "very substantial sell-off" of the US currency in recent days. "We're pretty much back at the levels where we were before all this euphoria about a swift military success" by coalition forces in Iraq developed, he said. Oil prices also dipped with the news that a labour strike in major producer Nigeria was called off, though exports continue to be disrupted. The price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery dropped 28 cents per barrel to 26.90 dollars in early trading. The three-day stoppage was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. Gold prices rose, with the spot price on the London Bullion Market up 1.8 dollars from the previous closing price at 335.65 dollars. Bond prices were up. The yield on the 10-year German government bond dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 4.02 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. burs-pw/dr/hd Markets-world
