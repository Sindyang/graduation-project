British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed a visit to China that had been scheduled for later this month, Chinese officials and the British embassy said Tuesday. "The British side said they wanted to postpone the visit because of certain reasons," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "As to the specific reasons, you can ask the British government, but it's certainly not because of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)." A spokesman at the British embassy in Beijing said the visit has been postponed, but also said it had nothing to do with SARS, the deadly atypical pneumonia which has killed at least 62 people around the world. "He's going to come later in the year," the British embassy official said. He declined to say why the trip was being postponed and whether it was due to the Iraq war. cs/ph/cl China-Britain
