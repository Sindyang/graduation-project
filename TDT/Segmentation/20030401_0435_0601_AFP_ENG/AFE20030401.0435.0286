The estimated death toll in Thailand's brutal drugs crackdown has risen to more than 2,000, police said Tuesday as the kingdom entered the third month of a self-declared war on methamphetamines. A total of 2,052 people have been murdered across the country since the drugs war began February 1, including 46 people who police have shot dead in self-defence, national Thai police spokesman Pongsapat Pongcharoen said in a statement. Six police officers were killed over the same period, while 15 were injured, he said. "The police chief is satisfied with the results over the past two months," Pongsapat said. While police are unable to say precisely how many of the killings were drugs-related, the national murder tally has been widely used as a proxy figure for the number of deaths resulting from the no-holds-barred drugs war. Authorities have repeatedly said that the rest were murders carried out by drug gang members in a bid to protect themselves from prosecution. Arrests over the period now totalled 46,776, while police seized 12.51 million methamphetamine tablets and 641 million baht (14.94 million dollars) worth of property belonging to suspected traffickers, Pongsapat said. "For the third month, police will focus on the arrests of big drugs traders and investigate further to see whether they can seize property believed to belong to those involved in the drugs business," he added. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is spearheading the war on drugs aimed at stamping out the rampant methamphetamine trade here, most of which flows in from neighbouring Myanmar and is allegedly produced by an ethnic Wa group aligned with Yangon. tp/sb/mlm/th Thailand-drugs
