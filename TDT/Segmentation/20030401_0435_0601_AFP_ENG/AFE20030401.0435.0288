WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell left the US capital early Tuesday on a hastily-arranged trip to Ankara and Brussels discuss the war against Iraq with Turkish, NATO and EU officials. Powell, who has been criticized for not traveling more to build support for the conflict, left Washington around 5:30 am (1030 GMT). He is expected to return on Thursday, spokesman Richard Boucher said. "In Ankara, Secretary Powell will meet with Turkish leaders to strengthen our relationship," Boucher told reporters, referring to Turkey as "key ally in a key place at a key time." The topics to be discussed included Iraq as well as the global war on terrorism and Cyprus, he said Monday. "In Brussels, the secretary intends to consult with members of the European Union and with NATO. (He) will focus on the war in Iraq and also on the broad range of post-conflict issues that we want to discuss with our European allies at this time," Boucher said. Among the post-conflict matters will be the possible participation of European countries and NATO members in peacekeeping duties in Iraq after Saddam Hussein has been ousted from power. "On the issue of stabilization and peacekeeping in post-Saddam Iraq, obviously there's a job that needs to be done," Boucher said. "That job of stabilization, that job of maintaining security for the Iraqi people, clearly American forces will be there to help with that, but there may be ways of involving others as well," he said. In Ankara, Powell will continue to hammer home Washington's opposition to Turkish troops entering northern Iraq as well as try to iron out festering differences over the deployment of US soldiers. Despite support from the new Turkish government, the country's parliament has thus far refused to allow US troops to use its soil for the Iraq invasion, forcing the Pentagon to revise its plans for opening a northern front. Powell could ask Ankara to broaden the permission it gave shortly after the war broke out for US warplanes to fly over Turkish airspace on their way to Iraq, to include a go-ahead for refueling over Turkey. However, Turkey's foreign minister Abdullah Gul said Tuesday that his government did not know of any new demands by the United States to help out in the war against Iraq. "There is nothing planned," Gul told the Anatolia news agency when queried on whether Powell would fly into Ankara with new requests. Another crucial issue should be Turkey's insistence it may send further troops into the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, a move fiercely resisted by Washington. Ankara fears that Kurds in northern Iraq could declare an independent state, setting a dangerous example to the big Kurdish population in Turkey's own south eastern corner, where a separatist uprising killed over 36,000 people in the 1990s. At NATO headquarters in the Belgian capital, Powell is expected to focus on the alliance's efforts to assist in the conflict, primarily with the defense of Turkey which proved to be a major source of division last month. Powell's trip this week will mark only the third time he has left the western hemisphere since November and comes amid criticism that his lack of travel may have hurt diplomatic efforts to shore up support for the war, particularly with Turkey. The secretary has rejected the criticism, noting that he met extensively with Turkish officials in Washington last month and in Davos, Switzerland in late January. In addition, he has spoken frequently about his four trips to the United Nations in New York since January in which he sought to build support for a now-failed new UN Security Council resolution that would have authorized the use of force against Iraq. Powell also travelled to Asia in late February, visiting Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul. mvl-col/fgf Iraq-war-US-Powell
