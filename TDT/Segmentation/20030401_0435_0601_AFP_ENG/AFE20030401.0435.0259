Danish international midfielder Stig Tofting faces a four month jail term after deciding not to appeal against his conviction for assault, it was reported here Tuesday. The 33-year-old World Cup player was convicted of assaulting a Copenhagen cafe manager during a night out with fellow internationals following the squad's return from the 2002 World Cup where they lost 3-0 to England in a second round match. But Danish TV2 television, quoting Tofting's lawyer Anders Nemeth, said on its website he would face the consequences of his conviction. Tofting's English Premiership club Bolton suspended the player last October pending the result of an appeal. His last match was in the FA Cup third round replay loss to Sunderland in January, but he is still on their books. bur/rw/ak Fbl-DEN-Tofting
