The European Central Bank is likely to hold its fire on interest rates, at least until the economic fog from the war in Iraq begins to lift, analysts here predicted on Tuesday. Nevertheless, the guardian of the euro is likely to ease monetary conditions in the euro area fairly soon in order to give the region's economy a much-needed boost, ECB watchers said. In a poll of 32 economists by AFP and its financial news subsidiary AFX, 28 predicted the ECB would hold its key interest rates steady when it holds its next regular policy-setting meeting in Rome on Thursday. The bank last trimmed euro-zone borrowing costs by a quarter of percentage point to 2.50 percent on March 6. But since then, comments by ECB officials have appeared to suggest the central bank will not be panicked into acting again too quickly, even as economic prospects for the single currency area appear to darken by the day. Only last week, the ECB's chief economist Otmar Issing warned against expecting too much of the ECB during the Iraq war. Issing told the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee in Brussels that central banks must help strengthen confidence in the current circumstances. But he added: "It also means cautioning against exaggerated expectations." The Spanish member of the ECB's executive board Eugenio Domingo Solans also warned against acting too hastily and Bundesbank President Ernst Welteke stuck his neck out even further, saying last week that the ECB is unlikely to cut its key interest rates while the economic fallout from Iraq remains unclear. "I am personally of the view that the effects of Iraq on the international situation are not clear," said Welteke, who as head of the German central bank sits on the ECB's governign council. "If they are not clearer (by April 3), we will assess the situation but we will not take a decision," he said. It all depends on how long the hostilities last. If they are over quickly, there is a hope falling oil prices and rising confidence will trigger the long-awaited turnaround. But if the war drags on for months, sapping confidence and threatening to drag the world economy into recession, the ECB will have no choice but to lower borrowing costs. The markets believe the latter scenario is more likely, a view backed up by the latest data. On Monday, the European Commission in Brussels calculated that, in March, business and economic confidence in Europe suffered its worst slump since the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in March. And in Paris on Tuesday, the French statistics institute INSEE calculated that household confidence in France fell sharply again in March to its lowest level since December 1996. Commerzbank economists Ralph Solveen and Christopher Weil said such data would provide a further argument for the ECB, but not as early as this week. "The gloomier economic outlook means greater pressure on the ECB to lower interest rates, but it will probably not act this week. We're nevertheless predicting another quarter-point cut this spring," they said. BNP Paribas Raymond van der Putten also said: "Given the lack of visibility, the ECB is likely to keep its rates unchanged at the meeting in Rome on Thursday." The ECB meets twice a year at venues outside its Frankfurt headquarters. "So far, it has always avoided taking significant monetary policy decisions at out-of-town occasions, which are more meant as public relations exercises," van der Putten said. But he, too, was believed the ECB "has not yet reached the end of its cutting cycle" and he was expecting a further rate cut of as much as half a percentage point "in May or June," unless high wage inflation and rising fiscal deficits prevented the ECB from acting. Goldman Sachs economists agreed. "No rate cut can be expected this week, but we see a half-point cut in the pipeline in the next few months," they wrote in a research note. spm/hd Iraq-war-ECB-eurozone-bank-economy-rate-forex
