Malaysia's health authorities Tuesday announced the country's first suspected cases of the deadly pneumonia virus that has sparked a global health scare, the official Bernama news agency reported. Health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif was quoted as saying that eight people with suspected symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been admitted to hospital for tests. A 37-year-old woman was in hospital in southern Johor state neighbouring Singapore, which has been hard hit by the illness, while the other seven cases were reported in and around the capital Kuala Lumpur, he said. The mysterious respiratory illness, which first erupted in southern China and has been transported to North America and Europe by travellers, has killed more than 60 people worldwide. Malaysia's Health Minister Chua Jui Meng, who visited Johor state Tuesday, urged the tens of thousands of Malaysians working in Singapore to take their annual leave in an effort to combat the spread of the disease. "If possible, the Malaysian workers are advised to take their annual leave," he was quoted as saying by Bernama. Some 50,000 Malaysians commute to-and-fro from the island republic daily. The World Health Organisation has listed Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. Singapore is among the worst hit, with four deaths and the number of reported cases now standing at 92, with 47 in hospital and 41 discharged so far. jsm/lb/cl Malaysia-health-pneumonia
