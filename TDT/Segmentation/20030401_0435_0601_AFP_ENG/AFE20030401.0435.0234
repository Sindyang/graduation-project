Italian police said Tuesday they had arrested four men in northern Italy suspected of links to an Islamic extremist organisation. A police spokesman declined to give details of the arrests, but newspapers reported that four men of Middle Eastern origin had been arrested overnight on suspicion of links to the Iraq-based Ansar al-Islam. The men were reported to be under police surveillance for around a year and preparing to leave Italy when they were arrested. Police in Milan said they would release more details later on Tuesday. clr/db/yad Iraq-war-Italy-arrests
