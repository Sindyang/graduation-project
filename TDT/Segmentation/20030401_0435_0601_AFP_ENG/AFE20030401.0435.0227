Indonesian shares closed flat Tuesday as late interest in telecoms stocks reversed earlier losses, dealers said. They said selling dominated the market amid worries about the regional Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and fears of a prolonged war in Iraq. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index ended up 0.051 points or 0.01 percent at 398.055 on volume of 129.9 million shares worth 127.192 billion rupiah (14.3 million dollars). The rupiah was at 8,883/8,888 against the dollar compared with Monday's close of 8,900/8,905. Panin Securities dealer Nico Suherman said overall sentiment remained weak amid prevailing concerns over the Iraq war and the increasing effects of SARS. He said the losses were offset by late bargain-hunting in selected blue chips, notably Telkom, as some investors considered them undervalued. Telkom closed up 24 rupiah at 3,650 while Indosat was up 50 at 7,650. Astra International was up 50 at 2,550. Gudang Garam traded flat at 7,400 while Sampoerna lost 50 to 2,900. Bank Central Asia was up 25 at 2,225. bur/sm/dv Stocks-Indonesia
