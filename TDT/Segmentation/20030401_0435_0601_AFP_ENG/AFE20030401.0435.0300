North Korea accused the United States Tuesday of stepping up spy flights over the Stalinist state in preparation for an invasion once the war with Iraq ends, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Yonhap quoted North Korea's official Radio Pyongyang as saying the US military flew 220 reconnaissance flights over the communist country in March, 40 more than the previous month. "This shows the US imperialists are trying to turn their spearhead of aggression to our republic after the war in Iraq," said the North's state radio station, monitored by Yonhap in Seoul. The US military conducted surveillance flights using RC-135, U-2, EP-3 and RC-7Bs spy planes backed by E-3 early warning aircraft, as well as radar-evading F-117 fighters. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) also blasted US surveillance missions and joint military exercises in South Korea as a prelude to war against Pyongyang. "The aerial espionage and war exercises go to clearly prove that the US is going to invade the DPRK (North Korea) at the end of the Iraqi war," the agency said in a dispatch monitored in Seoul. Minju Joson, the North's government newspaper, also accused Japan of attempting to strengthen its aerial espionage against the communist country on behalf of the United Sates during the war in Iraq. "Aerial espionage against a sovereign state is an act of encroaching upon its sovereignty," Miju Joson said in a commentary carried by KCNA. "Yet, the Japanese reactionaries are zealously following the US moves to militarily stifle the DPRK. This will only precipitate their self-destruction." The North has repeatedly maintained that the United States has been preparing a pre-emptive strike on North Korea's suspected nuclear facilities, which have been at the center of growing regional tensions. It has frequently denounced on-going US-South Korean military exercises, which the US military describes as routine and defensive in nature. The nuclear crisis erupted nearly six months ago when Washington accused Pyongyang of running a secret nuclear weapons program. Last month, four North Korean MiG-19 fighter jets intercepted a US reconnaissance plane over international waters 249 kilometers (150 miles) off the North's eastern coast in what the United States described as a dangerous provocation. Washington has denied charges that it plans to invade the North and said it is seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis. cw/jkw/sdm NKorea-US-spy
