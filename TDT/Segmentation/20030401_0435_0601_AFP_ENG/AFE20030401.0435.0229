Around 300 demonstrators calling for resignations over a city council vote-buying scandal clashed with police on Tuesday. Su Ying-kui, a parliamentarian from the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), had his glasses knocked off when he and several other TSU legislators led a charge at police lines guarding the council of Taiwan's second city, Kaohsiung. "Piggy councillors, step down!" chanted the group, which brought several pigs along to the protest. Inside the council building, some 30 deputies held their first scheduled meeting after Independent speaker Chu An-hsiung was detained over alleged vote-buying in city council polls in December. A city councillor presided over the meeting after deputy speaker Tsai Sung-hsiung was also taken into police custody on the same allegations. The scandal broke on December 25 when the 44 newly-elected Kaohsiung councillors voted in a secret ballot to elect Chu as the speaker and Tsai as the deputy speaker. Chu and Tsai, political independents labelled as key figures in Taiwan's notorious money politics, both received the votes of 11 Kuomintang deputies, six People First Party deputies and eight independents. Chu reportedly paid 10 million Taiwan dollars (287,000 dollars) to a number of councillors in exchange for their votes and Tsai paid up to half that amount. Deputies from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party had also taken bribes to vote for Chu, but were ordered to return the cash after intervention from President Chen Shui-bian, newspaper reports said. A total of 33 deputies from the three parties and independents were either questioned or had their homes searched. Calls for the resignation of the implicated councillors have been mounting. None of the councillors have been charged over the matter. cty/sdm/th Taiwan-politics-corruption-protest
