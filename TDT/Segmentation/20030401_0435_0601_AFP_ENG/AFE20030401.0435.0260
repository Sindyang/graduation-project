Red tape, face saving behind China's pneumonia silence: experts by Robert J. Saiget ATTENTION - ADDS quotes from Ministry of Health, foreign affairs /// BEIJING, April 1 (AFP) - Red tape, face-saving measures and institutional incompetence are most likely behind China's refusal to face up to the outbreak of a deadly respiratory disease, experts said Tuesday. Under international criticism, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) issued its first bulletin on atypcial pneumonia since March 26 urging all health departments to take effective measures to control the disease that has killed at least 62 people worldwide. Doctors were also urged to report to their provincial disease control centers any patients showing symptoms of atypical pneumonia, guidelines on the CDCP's website said. A team of World Health Organization experts was Tuesday also awaiting Beijing's permission to travel to southern Guangdong province where they believe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) first broke out last November. China has been the country worst hit by the mysterious virus, which has left 34 dead and more than 800 infected. Most SARS figures came from a report by Guangdong province that only went up to March 1. Fifteen people have died and more than 600 have been infected in neighboring Hong Kong after a doctor from Guangdong brought the illness into the territory. The WHO experts were reportedly seeking to investigate whether or not farm animals in southern China were the source of the virus. "China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire, a WHO expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission to go to Guangdong. "During a global epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. The team of five WHO experts was also waiting for China to fulfill its promise of providing daily provincial reports updating the progress of the disease nationwide, but so far such reports have not been forthcoming. "We are hoping to get updated information, but China has a system that is not exactly set up for this type of thing, so changes to the system is what is needed, as soon as possible," Maguire said. However, the Ministry of Health Tuesday said that a national level report on the disease would not be forthcoming because of bureaucratic wrangling over what diseases local health departments are required to report. "The illness is not on a list of infectious diseases, so there will not be any statistics published on the national level," ministry spokeswoman Li Jie told AFP. Provincial level health departments were expected to issue reports soon, she said without elaborating. Meanwhile, China's foreign ministry continued to insist the epidemic was under control, despite the WHO's view the disease was still spreading. "So far the disease has been under effective control. Most patients have recovered and have left hospital," ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters. "It has not spread to other places. Besides Guangdong, Beijing and Shanxi, we have not found cases in other parts of China." Hu Jia, director of the Beijing-based Aizhi Institute, a non-governmental AIDS awareness group, cast doubt on the government's statements, citing a long-standing policy to keep epidemics out of the public view. "This is an institutionalized problem, health officials are just not used to reporting because the spread of disease in China has always been secretive," Hu told AFP. "I think it is pretty clear, the government does not want to see China as the center of transmission of atypical pneumonia." The state-run press failed to carry any new updates on the spread of the disease on Tuesday, as more international events scheduled to be held in China were cancelled. Following the cancelation of two Rolling Stones concerts in Shanghai and Beijing and several sporting events last week, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced Tuesday it would postpone its annual China Business Summit. bur-sai/ph/pch Health-pneumonia-China
