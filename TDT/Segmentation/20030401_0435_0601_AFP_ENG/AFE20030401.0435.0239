The owners of a Lithuanian hotel have called in the police after accusing Scottish fans in the country for a Euro 2004 qualifier of vandalising a hotel room, police said Tuesday. Police said the manager of the hotel Viktorija accused two fans of breaking the furniture and window frames in one of the hotel rooms and throwing a television set out of the window. The two fans denied the charges saying they were drinking at the hotel bar and did not know who was responsible. Some 44 Scottish fans have booked rooms in the hotel through to April 5. The Scots travelled to Kaunas in Lithuania on Wednesday as surprise leaders of Euro 2004 Group Five after Lithuania's surprise 1-1 draw with World Cup runners-up Germany in Nuremberg. It was estimated that in total some 3,000 Scottish football fans are to come to Lithuania to support their team. rac/jmy/ak Fbl-Eur2004-LIT-SCO-fans
