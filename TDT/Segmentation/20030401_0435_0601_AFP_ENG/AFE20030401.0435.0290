The former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan was accused of imprisoning its political opponents Tuesday after an Azeri court handed out hefty sentences to leaders of an anti-government protest movement. Four men from the town of Nardaran, near the capital Baku, were sentenced to between five and nine years in jail for their part in a demonstration last year over living conditions which ended in violent clashes with police. But supporters of the men said they were innocent of the charges and were being victimised because their town is a stronghold of opposition to the authocratic rule of Azerbaijan's President Heidar Aliyev. Aliyev, a 79-year-old former KGB general, is running for a third term in office in presidential elections scheduled for later this year. "These people... are political prisoners," said Arzu Abdullayeva, head of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly, a prominent human rights group in Azerbaijan. "Their town has no jobs, no electricity, it is hard for them to live. They protested to demand their constitutional rights. That is the normal right of any citizen but it turns out that in Azerbaijan that is not allowed." The four men given jail sentences Tuesday were found guilty of organising mass disorder, resisting the police and possessing illegal arms. Another 11 defendants walked free after being given non-custodial sentences. One of the jailed men, Alikram Aliyev, is the chairman of Azerbaijan's outlawed Islamic Party. He was given the stiffest sentence of nine years in a penal colony. The verdicts are likely to add to international pressure on Azerbaijan, which is already under investigation from the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe for holding political prisoners. Nardaran, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Baku, was a prosperous town under Soviet rule but now -- as in many other places in Azerbaijan -- unemployment is high and gas and electricity supplies are frequently cut off. Early last year residents began staging demonstrations to demand better living conditions. But the protests erupted into violence in June last year when dozens of riot police were ordered in to put down the demonstrations. One local man died of gunshot wounds, and dozens of police and residents were also injured in the clashes. Soon after, police rounded up men they suspected of orchestrating the violence. The authorities alleged that the people behind the clashes were Islamic radicals who planned to overthrow the country's secular government with backing from neighbouring Iran. However, Nardaran residents deny there is any political element to their protests. They said Tuesday they were deciding whether to launch a new round of demonstrations to protest the court's verdict. "This is an unjust decision and a violation of the constitution," Hadzhiaga Nuriyev, a village elder from Nardaran, said outside the court. "We will use all legal means available to get this overturned." sab-clo/hm/ds Azerbaijan-protest-court
