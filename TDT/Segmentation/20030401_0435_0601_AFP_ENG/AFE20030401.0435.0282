France's Societe Generale Group Tuesday said it would establish this week a joint venture fund management with Chinese steel conglomerate Shanghai Baosteel Group. The joint venture unites Societe Generale's fund management group, SG Asset Management Co. (SGAM), and Baosteel's Fortune Trust and Investment Co. in a deal that was officially approved last October. SGAM paid four million dollars for its 33 percent of the new company headquartered in the eastern city of Shanghai, which plans to begin business with registered capital of 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars). But before Fortune SGAM begins trading its umbrella fund, made up of three main funds including a bond fund, an equity fund and a fund made up of both types of securities, it will seek to raise three billion yuan in capital, said Dennis Lefranc, deputy general manager of Fortune SGAM. "We will raise three billion yuan, but that is actually quite difficult to predict," Lefranc said. "Market conditions are very difficult. Now everything is very volatile." If the funds' performance goes well, SG Asset hopes to increase its stake in the venture to 49 percent, the maximum allowed for a foreign company according to rules set out when China joined the World Trade Organization in December of 2001. While strict regulations set by the Chinese government will not allow the reduction of risk with complex derivatives, which is common in developed markets, the funds will bring an additional investment tool to China's nascent stockmarkets, Lefranc said. Sino-foreign fund management joint ventures approved in recent weeks hope to some of more than one trillion dollars in China's household savings, which are largely idling in domestic banks at annual interest rates of 1.98 percent. Last month ING Group's fund management arm, ING Investment Management and China Merchants Fund Management became the mainland's first joint venture to launch open-ended umbrella funds. Another foreign company that has established a fund management joint venture is fellow Dutch financial group and rival ABN Amro. Allianz, Invesco and Fortis are awaiting final approval to launch their own funds. bms/bro China-SocieteGenerale-France-company-fund
