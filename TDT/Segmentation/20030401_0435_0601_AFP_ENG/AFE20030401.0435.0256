The recent outbreak of a killer respiratory illness and the war in Iraq have had no immediate impact on the ratings and outlook of Taiwan's biggest air carrier China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan Ratings Corp. said Tuesday. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) would have a stronger impact than the Iraq war on the carrier, with China and Hong Kong the two worst hit areas, the agency, a partner of Standard and Poor's, said in a statement. Demand for air travel would decline and China Airlines' overall performance was likely to weaken in the near term. But the carrier's current credit protection measures are in line with its rating, Taiwan Ratings said. The agency will review China Airlines' rating and outlook if the impact of SARS and the Iraq war becomes more severe than expected and affects the company's load factors, it added. bur/cty/dv Health-pneumonia-Taiwan-air-CAL-company
