The Israeli army on Tuesday destroyed the West Bank house of a suicide bomber who injured 26 people and another militant allegedly linked to jailed Fatah deputy Marwan Barghuti, officials said. The army demolished the house near Tulkarem of Rami Ghanen, 20, a first-year student from Al-Quds university in the northern town, who on Sunday blew himself apart in the seaside resort of Netanya, an army spokesman said. "The destruction of terrorists houses constitutes a message to the terrorists and their accomplices that all those involved will pay for their acts," said the army spokesman. The army also destroyed the house of Nasser Abu Hmeid, jailed by Israel on charges of attacks in the name of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an armed offshoot of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Israel accuses him of being a lieutenant of Barghuti, the Fatah's West Bank leader who is facing charges of terrorism and heading the Al-Aqsa group. His house was in the Al-Amari refugee camp in Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem. Another 30 Palestinians wanted by Israel were arrested overnight in sweeps of the West Bank, reoccupied by the army since a spate of suicide bombings last June, officials said. The army has destroyed some 200 houses belonging to militants in a bid to discourage further attacks. Rights groups have attacked the policy for also punishing the bombers' families who are often left destitute after losing their homes. jlr/jh/dab Mideast-house-demolish
