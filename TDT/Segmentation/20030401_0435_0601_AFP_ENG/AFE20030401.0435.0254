Indian Kashmir's influential separatist alliance Tuesday urged Hindus not to leave the Muslim-dominated Kashmir valley following the massacre of 24 Hindus. "We have been disturbed by the reports that the members of minority community have decided to leave the valley after the Nadi Marg massacre," the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) said in a statement. Some 24 Hindus -- 11 men, 11 women and two children -- were lined up and sprayed with bullets by unidentified gunmen in the village of Nadi Marg on the evening of March 23. Kashmiri Hindus, also called Pandits, have demanded they be moved to the Hindu-dominated Jammu region of Kashmir or other parts of India. More than 200,000 Hindus have left Kashmir since 1989 when an anti-Indian Muslim rebellion broke out. Fighting has claimed nearly 38,000 lives since then. Some 10,000 Hindus have stayed behind, but many now want to leave. "The Hurriyat, on behalf of the Muslims of Kashmir, makes a passionate appeal to oru Kashmiri Pandit brothers to reconsider their decision (to leave)," a statement said. "The Hurriyat want the lives and properties of all residents of Kashmir to be secure. But that is only possible when an impartial enquiry is held into the gruesome massacres of the members of the minority communities in Kashmir, to expose the ruthless killers once for all." Many Kashmiri Hindu leaders have asked Kashmiri separatists to guarantee their safety. "The Hurriyat understands that providing security is the jurisdiction of the government," the statement said. The Nadi Marg massacre was the worst in Kashmir involving Hindus. On March 20, 2000 some 37 Sikhs were killed in the south Kashmir village of Chattisinghpora on the eve of then-US President Bill Clinton's visit to India. str/an/sdm India-Kashmir-Hindus
