French engineering group Alstom said on Tuesday it had received a takeover bid, responding to rumours that had sent its share price rocketing in early trading. However, the company said it was sceptical about the seriousness of the offer, which was made in the name of an unheard-of company. "Alstom confirms having received a letter from a company calling itself MJ Global Acquisition, declaring its ambition to acquire the totality of Alstom's capital," Alstom said in a statement. However, the letter "raised doubts about the seriousness of the bid", it added. The price of Alstom shares surged by 15.6 percent to 1.62 euros (1.76 dollars) in early trading here on Tuesday on rumours that Dutch financier Mattew Jean might make a takeover bid. Later the shares fell back slightly to 1.60 euros in mid-morning trading, still up 14.2 percent on Monday's close. Brokerage CDC Ixis said in an earlier note to its customers: "A Dutch financier is reported to have made an offer valuing the share at 2.0 euros (2.17 dollars) which the Alstom board has rejected. He is believed to be about to offer 2.5 euros (2.72 dollars) per share." The company is expected to report a loss of about 1.3 million euros (1.4 million dollars) for the year to March, is weighed down by debt of 5.0 billion euros (5.45 billion dollars) and intends to raise 600 million euros (654 million dollars) in new capital to strengthen strained cash resources. Alstom, which builds power stations, high-speed-train rolling stock and ships, recently announced a change of strategy to strengthen its finances. New chief executive Patrick Kron has announced that the group will raise 3.0 billion euros (3.27 billion dollars) through asset sales by 2005. hz/lmf/hd France-engineering-energy-company-takeover-Alstom
