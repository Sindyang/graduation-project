Malaysian stocks closed lower Tuesday as investors reduced their exposure because of concerns over the Iraq war and a deadly virus outbreak, dealers said. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index closed down 8.61 points or 1.35 percent at 627.11. Dealers said fears of a prolonged war in Iraq and the Severe Acute Repiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak continued to dampen market sentiment.

Some 160.4 million shares were traded, valued at about 345.4 million ringgit (91 million dollars). Losers outnumbered gainers 291 to 188 while 220 stocks were unchanged and 431 untraded.
