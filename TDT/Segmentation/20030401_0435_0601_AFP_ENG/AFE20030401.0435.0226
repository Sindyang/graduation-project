Manchester United defender Laurent Blanc is set to retire at the end of the season. The 37-year-old told MUTV he did not expect an extension to his current contract which expires in the summer. "Manchester United existed before me and it will exist after me," he said. "I don't know what I will do next year but I think I need a break." Many pundits questioned the wisdom of Blanc's arrival at Old Trafford on a free transfer from Inter Milan 18 months ago. The Frenchman is now clearly past his best and his lack of pace was badly exposed by Albert Luque against Deportivo La Coruna in Spain last month. However, manager Alex Ferguson believes Blanc's presence on the training ground can provide the younger members of his defence with valuable lessons which they can take into the remainder of their own careers. Blanc won the World Cup and European championship with France before quitting international football in 2000. He started his career with French Second Division side Montpellier in 1983 and enjoyed promotion to the top flight after the 1986/87 season. His performances in the heart of their defence as well as in front of the opposition goal - he scored eighteen goals in 34 games in 1986/87 and fifteen in 34 in 1988/89 - caught the eye of the French national team and he made his international debut against Ireland in February 1989. He won the French Cup with Montpellier the same season. Blanc faced United in his last season with Montpellier, impressing all as the Reds won over two legs on their way to European Cup Winners' Cup glory in 1991. Laurent moved to Italy in 1991/92, playing for Napoli for a season, before returning to France with Nimes. After a season with Nimes he moved on to St Etienne, where he scored 18 goals in two seasons. From there it was on to Auxerre for a year, when he was part of a French League and Cup Double winning side. Next stop on Blanc's career path was Spain's Primera Liga, where he played alongside Ronaldo at Barcelona under Bobby Robson. A fantastic 1996 season saw Barca win the Spanish Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup while finishing second in the League. But the next year he joined Olympique Marseille. It was while with Marseille that Blanc was the mainstay of the World Cup winning French side in 1998. Having played in all but one game up until the final, Blanc was banned for the match against Brazil. He was harshly sent off in the semi when Croatia's Slaven Bilic feigned injury. Laurent switched back to Serie A and Inter Milan in August 1999, before adding to his incredible medal collection by winning Euro 2000 with 'Les Bleus.' He retired from international football after a friendly against England on 2 September 2000. Blanc signed for United in August 2001, replacing Jaap Stam in the heart of the Old Trafford defence. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-ManUtd-FRA-Blanc
