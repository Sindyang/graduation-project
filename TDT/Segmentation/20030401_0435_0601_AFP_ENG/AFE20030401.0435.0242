China will bring in veteran coach Jiang Xingquan to lead the men's national basketball team following dismal performances last year at the World Championships and the Asian Games, press reports said Tuesday. Jiang, who coached China to its highest-ever eighth place finish at the 1994 World Championships, was expected to be named soon to head the national team at this September's Asian Men's Championships in Harbin, China, the Beijing Evening News reported. The 62-year old Jiang last year helped the Xinjiang Guanghui Club advance from China's B league to a surprising fourth place finish in the just completed top division regular season. He will replace Wang Fei, who coached China to a disappointing 12th place finish at last summer's World Championships in Indianapolis and a second place finish to South Korea at the Asian Games in September. China, which has traditionally dominated Asian basketball, needs to win the Asian Championships if it hopes to receive an automatic berth to the 2004 Olympic Games. NBA standout Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets, is expected to join up with the national team for the Asian Championships as will San Antonio backup center Menk Bateer. sai/cl/ak Basket-CHN
