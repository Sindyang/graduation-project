Malaysia's health authorities Tuesday announced the country's first suspected cases of the deadly pneumonia virus that has sparked a global health scare, the official Bernama news agency reported. Health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif was quoted as saying that eight people with symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been admitted to hospital for tests. A 37-year-old woman was in hospital in southern Johor state neighbouring Singapore, which has been hard hit by the illness, while the other seven cases were reported in Kuala Lumpur, he said. The mysterious respiratory illness which first erupted in southern China and has been transported to North America and Europe by travellers has killed more than 60 people worldwide. jsm/lb/cl Health-pneumonia-Malaysia-cases
