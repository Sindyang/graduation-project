Indonesian shares closed flat on Tuesday as late interest in telecoms stocks reversed earlier losses, dealers said. They said selling dominated the market amid worries about the regional Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and fears of a prolonged war in Iraq. The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index ended up 0.051 points or 0.01 percent at 398.055 on volume of 129.9 million shares worth 127.192 billion rupiah (14.3 million dollars). bur/sm/dv Stocks-Indonesia-close
