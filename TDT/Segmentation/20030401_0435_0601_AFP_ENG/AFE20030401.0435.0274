Saudi shares ended the first three months of 2003 up 10.4 percent as the index hit a nine-month high amid heavy trading as the US-led war rages on in Iraq, traders said. The Tadawul All-Shares Index (TASI) finished the first quarter on 2,779.10 points from the 2002 closing of 2,518.08 points. It is the highest level seen since early July last year. The TASI is still down five percent from its all-time high of 2,927.23 points recorded on May 20 last year. The market, the most vibrant in the Arab world, witnessed the most hectic activity after the outbreak of the war on March 20. Since then it has soared about 10 percent. Economists attributed the increase to initial expectations the war would be short, coupled with the fact that prices of most shares had dropped sharply in January and February over war fears. Abundant cashflow, low interest rates and the wait-and-see attitude in other sectors have attracted new funds into the market. Turnover in the first three months was 44.1 billion riyals (11.75 billion dollars) which is almost one-third of last year's value and half of all 2002. Some 481.8 million shares changed hands during the period. The market was positively influenced by the listing on January 25 of Saudi Telecom which has become the largest firm on the bourse in terms of market value, trading and share price increase. Saudi Telecom shares have shot up 34.9 percent since floatation, followed by the Saudi Electricity Co. (SEC), the third largest firm, which rose 29.5 percent. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), which ranks second, gained 8.8 percent. Together the nine listed commercial banks, Saudi Telecom, SEC and SABIC make up 85 percent of the market capitalization. TASI has the highest capitalization of any stock market in the Arab world at about 98 billion dollars at the end of the first quarter of 2003, but operates only as an interbank system. oh/bp/dab Stocks-Saudi
