Indonesia on Tuesday announced new measures to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and said a woman hospital patient may be the first victim within the country. "We suspect that she might be suffering from SARS but we have to wait for the incubation period," said Health Minister Achmad Suyudi. He said the woman, who has been transferred to a North Jakarta hospital designated to treat SARS patients, had been in contact with someone from Singapore but gave no details. Suyudi said he would issue an order Thursday forcing people either suffering from SARS or suspected to be infected to undergo hospital treatment. A 17-year-old Indonesian student in Singapore has contracted SARS after visiting the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and Hong Kong with his brother and parents. Suyudi told reporters a female Indonesian worker is in hospital in Hong Kong with the viral disease. He was speaking after a meeting at the office of top welfare minister Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially deadly infection. Suyudi said the government was importing face masks from China and the United States. Indonesia has no confirmed cases despite its proximity to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases including four deaths. Indonesia also announced closer checks on incoming travellers. The immigration department said its staff, who were wearing masks, were watching arriving passengers at air and sea ports for any symptoms. Incoming passengers must fill in a health form. "Any suspicious cases will be set apart by quarantine officials and if they are ascertained to be carrying the disease, we will deport them to their country of departure as the law stipulates," said department spokesman, Ade Endang Dahlan. The number of ferry passengers between Indonesia's Batam island and nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 percent, the state Antara news agency said. Authorities and hoteliers in Batam distributed thousands of masks. The health ministry has opened special phone lines for inquiries and briefed hospitals across the country on the disease. bs/vt/sm/cl Health-pneumonia-Indonesia
