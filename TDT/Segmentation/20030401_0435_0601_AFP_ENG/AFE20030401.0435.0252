President Saddam Hussein has decided to decorate soldiers who have put up stiff resistance against US and British troops in the south of the country, Iraqi satellite television said Tuesday. Two medals -- the Decoration of Umm al-Maarek or the Mother of All Battles, as Baghdad calls the 1991 Gulf War, and the Wisam al-Rafidain, or Order of the Two Rivers -- would be awarded to the entire 45th Brigade, which defended the port city of Umm Qasr, according to a presidential decree read on air. Umm Qasr, Iraq's only deep-water seaport on its short Gulf coastline, lies on the western side of the Fao Peninsula 460 kilometres (280 miles) south of Baghdad. Few had expected a scrap over the small port city, but it took crack British and US forces six days to quell Iraqi resistance. Baghdad still denies it has fallen. The 45th Brigade's soldiers would also receive medals for bravery, it said, adding that special decorations would be awarded posthumously to those killed in the fighting. Medals for bravery would also be awarded to fighters confronting coalition troops in Nasiriyah, some 350 kilometres (220 miles) south of Baghdad, and in the southeastern Fao peninsula, which British forces say they have secured. Nasiriyah, with its bridges crossing the Euphrates, has been the scene of heavy combat between US marines and Iraqi irregulars fighting to interrupt the flow of supplies to US forces farther north. The officers commanding the Nasiriyah and Fao troops will also receive both the Mother of All Battles medal and Order of the Two Rivers, according to the decrees. The state INA news agency, meanwhile, reported that Saddam had decided to provide families of those who fought at Umm Qasr and Nasiriyah with two million dinars (6,740 dollars) each. Saddam reportedly ordered a non-commissioned officer who killed at least four US soldiers in a suicide attack Saturday be promoted posthumously to colonel and also showered money on his family. ma/dab/kir Iraq-war-Saddam-medals
