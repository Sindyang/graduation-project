The collision of a car carrying containers of petrol and diesel into the walls of the British embassy compound here was an "accident", a foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday. "This accident, in which the driver unfortunately lost his life, was due to speeding," said Hamid Reza Asefi, cited by the official IRNA news agency. "The accident happened after rain fell last night which made the road slippery," he added. Diplomatic sources said the British were investigating the incident, and they believed it was "still a possibility" it was an attack. "Precautions have been taken" around the embassy, a spokesperson told AFP. The car smashed into the walls of the embassy compound late Monday and burst into flames, killing the driver but injuring nobody inside the building, according to Iranian officials. The 35-year-old driver worked for the energy ministry, they said, adding that he was not believed to have had "political motives." Britain's Home Secretary David Blunkett had said there was no immediate evidence it was a terrorist act. On Friday after a massive demonstration against the war against Iraq by the United States and Britain, hundreds of protesters hurled stones at the British embassy, breaking several windows. sgh-lal/dab Iran-Britain-embassy
