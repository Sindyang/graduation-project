The dollar showed signs of stabilising on Tuesday after suffering heavy recent losses, with some dealers taking the view that recent pessimism over progress by coalition forces in Iraq might have been overdone. The single European currency dipped to 1.0896 dollars from 1.0933 late on Monday in New York. The dollar rose to 118.04 yen from 117.95 on Monday. Michael Klawitter, economist at the German bank WestLB, said that the steadier tone of the dollar was not surprising given the "very substantial sell-off" of the US currency in recent days. "We're pretty much back at the levels where we were before all this euphoria about a swift military success" by coalition forces in Iraq developed, he added. With little fresh market-moving news from the Gulf, the dollar could enjoy a brief period of respite, Klawitter said. "Generally there is broad consensus that the US dollar will weaken further over the next one month or three months. In the short term, however, there is a perception now that all the pessimism on the developments in the war against Iraq probably is slightly overdone," he said. But other analysts said that any new headline or economic data from the United States could send the US unit limping lower again. "Attention is largely centralised on the war in Iraq and the prospects for a longer conflict," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "Any news appears to be bad news for the dollar," she added. With the dollar still the whipping boy of the market, dealers largely overlooked some gloomy data from the euro-zone and Japan. The euro zone purchasing managers' index fell by more than expected to 48.4 in March from 50.1 in February, pointing to an increased risk of recession in the manufacturing sector, economists said. "The recessionary risk in the euro zone is quite substantial but again it is nothing that in the short term affects the currency market given that it remains driven by dollar sentiment," said Klawitter. The Bank of Japan's Tankan survey meanwhile showed business confidence among large manufacturers declined to minus 10 in the three months to March from minus nine in the previous quarter. Sentiment among large non-manufacturers improved slightly to minus 14 from minus 16. "Investors did not take the Tankan results as a lead in the market. They were more concerned about the possibility of a long war in Iraq and its impact on the US economy," said Masato Imai, dealer at UFJ Holdings in Tokyo. The euro was changing hands at 1.0896 dollars from 1.0924 late on Monday in New York, 129.00 yen (128.82), 0.6894 pounds (0.6898) and 1.4762 Swiss francs (1.4743). The dollar was being quoted at 118.04 yen (117.95) and 1.3545 Swiss francs (1.3492). The pound was at 1.5811 dollars (1.5830), 187.00 yen (186.71) and 2.1413 Swiss francs (2.1358). On the London Bullion Market, the price of an ounce of gold rose to 335.88 dollars from 334.85 on Monday afternoon. dr/hd Forex-Europe
