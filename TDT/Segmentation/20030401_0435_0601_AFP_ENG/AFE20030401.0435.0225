Thailand's health ministry on Tuesday declared the killer virus spreading across the globe as a serious communicable disease, an emergency move authorising the quarantine of suspected carriers for 14 days. The declaration "will enable public health officials to quarantine suspects who have returned from cities or countries where the disease has broken out for 14 days," Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told reporters. All people returning from regional areas affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- mainly Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, Vietnam and Taiwan -- should quarantine themselves for 14 days, Sudarat said. They should not attend work or places of study and should isolate themselves from family members while following ministry hygiene guidelines. "We have to ask for full cooperation from the Thai people. We don't want to be in the same situation as Hong Kong and Singapore," she said. The health ministry has also asked staff in hotels with tourists from outbreak areas to don masks, follow strict personal hygiene regulations and inform the ministry if guests appear to be suffering from the disease. The mysterious illness has now infected more than 1,700 people in 15 countries. According to a tally compiled by AFP, the worldwide death toll from SARS stands at 62, with 34 deaths in China, 15 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, Canada and Singapore, and one in Thailand. The Thai cabinet on Tuesday banned government and state enterprise officials from travelling to Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Canada. The health ministry meanwhile boosted its medical staff at Bangkok's international airport from 10 to 15 per shift to screen incoming passengers, the health ministry's permanent secretary Vallop Thaineau said. Ten medical staff also remained on stand-by to supervise travellers requiring quarantine at the adjacent military airport, he said. Vallop admitted that the latest stringent measures would have negative repercussions on the Thai tourism industry. "The public health ministry is coordinating with the Air Force Commander to alert the public to the situation, and screen and separate passengers who may be affected with SARS. It's necessary although it will affect tourism," he said. No plans were afoot to ban tourists from outbreak countries, he added. Government spokesman Sita Divari revealed that Thailand's multi-billion dollar tourism industry was already suffering. "The tourism minister reported to the cabinet that tourist arrivals have dropped between 10 and 20 percent," Sita said. One person has died of SARS in Thailand but there has been no transmission here, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO doctor Carlo Urbani, who first alerted colleagues to SARS in Vietnam, died in Bangkok Saturday. Health ministry officials said Tuesday two other cases were being monitored on suspicion of being SARS. One person is being monitored in a Bangkok hospital while a Thai national who had returned from work in Hong Kong to visit relatives in southern Songkhla and fell ill there was in isolation. SARS erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, from where it spread to Hong Kong and has since been taken worldwide in unprecedented fashion by airline passengers. ask-sb/mlm/sdm Health-pneumonia-Thailand
