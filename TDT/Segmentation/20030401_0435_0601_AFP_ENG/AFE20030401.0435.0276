China on Tuesday rejected as "irresponsible" a US report that accused the country of having a poor human rights record and told the United States stop meddling in the affairs of other nations. "It made no regard of the facts and made irresponsible accusations of China's human rights situation," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "We've been protecting and promoting human rights," Liu said at a regular press briefing. "We would like to use this opportunity to ask the United States not to interfere in other people's internal affairs." The United States on Monday accused China's communist leaders of presiding over a "poor" human rights record last year, saying the government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses. It highlighted the arrests of democracy activists, the imposition of death sentences without due process on two Tibetans, and the trials of labor leaders on subversion charges. It said China was also quick to suppress religious, political and social groups, as well as individuals perceived to be a threat to government power or to national stability, including citizens who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views. Human rights have long been a source of contention between the two countries, which while enjoying improved relations in the past year due to cooperation in fighting terrorism and booming trade, have not ironed out key differences such as rights matters. cs/ph/sdm/cl US-rights-China-reax
