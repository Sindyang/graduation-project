Virus outbreak to cast a pall over Asian economies: investment bank ATTENTION - UPDATES Hong Kong toll, adds background, details /// HONG KONG, April 1 (AFP) - The deadly outbreak of viral pneumonia is casting a dark cloud over Asian economies, with growth rates this year likely to be slashed by up to 1.5 percentage points, an investment bank said Tuesday. "We are of the view that economic growth will slow in Asia as a result of the decline in the two pillars of Asia's economies -- tourism and private consumption," BNP Paribas Peregrine said in a report. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, spread to Hong Kong and onwards to other parts of the world, killing more than 60 people so far. The virus has so far claimed 16 lives in Hong Kong and infected 685, with tourism and aviation industries throughout Asia suffering as travellers choose to stay home. "The SARS epidemic will cast a long dry spell on tourism and its associated industries. We expect the airline, hotel, trade, retail and property sectors to be adversely affected by the pneumonia problem," BNP Paribas Peregrine said. The report cited comments by travel booking firm Abacus, which handles reservations for 80 percent of Hong Kong's travel agents, saying sales have fallen about a third from a year ago. Airlines have cut their services due to both the Iraq war and the virus, with services to and from Hong Kong being the worst affected. However, the report added some sectors such as supermarkets, newspapers and television stations would benefit from the public preference to stay home. The cuts to economic growth forecasts for the region have also been made as it becomes clear the US-led war in Iraq will last longer than initially expected. This is a bigger factor than SARS in some countries such as South Korea where BNP Paribas has cut its growth forecast to 4.0 percent from 5.1 percent. But for much of Asia, the virus is arguably a bigger problem, the report said. The biggest growth forecast cut is for Singapore, which is heavily reliant on tourism. Growth this year is now seen at 2.5 percent, down from 4.0 percent. Hong Kong's expected growth has been cut to 0.9 percent from 1.5 percent, Taiwan to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and Malaysia to 4.0 percent from 4.7 percent. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Thailand's growth is seen easing to 3.5 percent from 4.0 percent forecast earlier, Indonesia is seen falling to 3.9 percent from 4.3 percent and the Philippines is estimated at 3.0 percent, down from 3.5 percent. BNP Paribas Peregrine is maintaining its 7.4 percent growth forecast for China, which is less dependent on tourism, but said the estimate could be cut by 0.2 to 1.0 percentage points if the situation worsens. Dutch banking group ABN Amro on Monday cut its economic growth forecast for Hong Kong this year by 0.5 percentage points to 3.5 percent due to the impact of SARS. Deutsche Bank said last week the disease could reduce Hong Kong's growth by 0.4 percentage points from the earlier forecast 3.3 percent. bro/dv Health-pneumonia-Asia-economy
