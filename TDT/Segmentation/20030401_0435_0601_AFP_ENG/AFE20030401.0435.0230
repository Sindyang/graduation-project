The prime ministers and foreign ministers of Turkey and Greece will discuss the divided island of Cyprus on April 8, on the sidelines of a summit of Balkan countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday. Turkey will not give up its efforts to end the long-running division of Cyprus just because its rival Cypriot Greek and Turkish communities failed last month to agree on a United Nations plan to reuinte the Mediterranean island, Erdogan told parliamentarians from his ruling Justice and Development Party. "We want to make new openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan said. He added that Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway Turkish state in the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new steps" ahead of the planned Belgrade meeting. han/fc/gil Cyprus-Turkey-Greece
