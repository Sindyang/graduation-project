Arsenal's French striker Robert Pires is set to miss their Premiership clash at Aston Villa on Saturday. An injury to his right ankle, picked up in the FA Cup win at Chelsea a week ago, has failed to heal and he missed France's game against Malta on Saturday. He has also been ruled out of Wednesday's clash with Israel in Sicily. Arsenal said Pires, 30, had treatment in the south of France and was due back at Highbury later Tuesday for further checks. He was expected to be fit for the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United on Saturday week. Pires missed last year's World Cup and the run-in to the English title after rupturing knee ligaments at the back end of last season. But he has bounced back impressively this season. Arsenal's French manager Arsene Wenger brought him to Highbury from Marseille in 2000 in an eight million pound (13 million dollar) move. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-Arsenal-Pires
