The Chechens' votes have been counted, the Kremlin and the pro-Russian administration have duly claimed their triumph -- and the people of the small village of Alkhan-Kala are looking forward to reaping the benefits. Russia is proclaiming the result of the March 23 referendum in which, according to official figures, nearly nine electors out of 10 approved a new constitution, as the beginning of the end of the conflict that has riven this scenic southern republic for most of the past decade. The immediate priorities for the villagers of Alkhan-Kala, a few kilometres (miles) west of the capital Grozny, are running water, a road-bridge and better security. "The authorities have promised us compensation for the destruction of the houses, starting in April. We want to start rebuilding, but for that we'll need water," said Musa Adayev. Alkhan-Kala was particularly badly damaged during the first Chechen war of 1994-96, and shortly after the latest conflict erupted in October 1999 the water pipes that supplied the village were destroyed. Since then local people have had to pay out for water brought to them in tanker trucks, a heavy expense for budgets that often consist of little more than pensions or unemployment benefits. The village's proximity to the capital Grozny has meant that the travails of war have been deeply felt here, with frequent sweeps by Russian troops and occasional rebel incursions. Even on the eve of the poll, separatists fired at the local police station and buildings which had been taken over temporarily by federal forces. And yet large numbers of villagers turned out to vote in a gesture of hope. If nothing else, it might bring nearer the day when the water flowed again. The road-bridge also features high on the local wish-list. The old bridge over the river Sunzha that divides the village was destroyed in late 2000. A light footbridge has temporarily replaced it, but to get across the river by car requires a half-hour journey. The former mayor elected in mid-2001, Malika Umazheva, had promised a new supply and a new road-bridge, but she was shot dead in her home, as her predecessor had been, executed as a traitor by rebels who consider all officials working with the pro-Russian administration as collaborators. Last Sunday, a week after the referendum, Russian troops combed the village in an operation reminiscent of the dreaded sweeps of the bad old days. But for once they made no arrests, an outcome itself seen as a sign of hope. The troops were looking for the killer of a young Russian woman whose body had been found in the river by some village children. "They must find and punish whoever did this to the woman, especially since she had nothing to do with the army," villager Ayub said. "There are bandits in our village, like elsewhere, who have no links with the resistance and are prepared to kill anyone, Chechen or Russian, if it makes them money. They should be shot on the spot," he said, voicing the widely held concern over insecurity. Ayub hoped that with the referendum out of the way, the pro-Russian authorities would seize the opportunity to boost confidence in the republic's future. There were new signs of an easing of tensions in Grozny, the local human rights centre said in a statement. A roadblock at the end of a bridge over the Sunzha has been removed, and the authorities have stepping up their announcements of compensation to be made for the damage caused to housing, it said. However the compensation process is likely to be hampered by the inability of most municipalities to supply lists of the residents concerned. aa-via/bb/ds Russia-Chechnya
