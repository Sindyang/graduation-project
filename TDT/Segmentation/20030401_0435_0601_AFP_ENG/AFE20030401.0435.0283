Japan Post kicks off to fanfare, anxiety in 'first step' to privatisation by Ryan Nakashima = (PICTURE) = ATTENTION - ADDS details, quotes /// TOKYO, April 1 (AFP) - Japan Post kicked off its first day as a corporation Tuesday to fanfare and anxiety as it took over the nation's postal services and a massive 359 trillion yen (three trillion dollars) in savings and insurance funds. President Masaharu Ikuta, noting the biggest change in the postal services' 132-year history, promised to improve services and vowed the firm would accumulate net profit of 4.0 trillion yen in the four years to March 2007. "We promise to work together so that people will say that postal services have improved since the launch of Japan Post," Ikuta said at a banner-unveiling ceremony at the headquarters in Tokyo. The mail delivery business was expected to post a 2.6 billion yen net loss in the year to March 2004, smaller than the 16.6 billion yen loss a year earlier, a Japan Post spokeswoman said. The three services as a whole posted a 671.9 billion yen net profit in the year to March 2002. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said it was a "first step" in realising one of his long-cherished pet reform projects, hatched even before becoming president of the Liberal Democratic Party. "This is effectively the first step toward privatisation," he said. "I want them to improve management and privatise this business smoothly so the government can sell their shares in it at high prices." The government planned to capitalise Japan Post with at least one trillion yen. Ikuta, lauded as a champion of reform for helping resuscitate Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Japan's second largest shipping company, as its chairman, said he hoped to achieve the profit goal through greater efficiency rather than job cuts. Vice President Toshihiro Takahashi, a former Toyota Motor Corp. managing director, was also expected to bring Toyota-style efficiencies to the company. But critics wondered whether the team could succeed in steering the massive postal system, with 280,000 employees and 24,700 post offices nationwide, toward privatisation. "The original idea of the reform was to break the monopoly on postal services and reform the postal savings and insurance systems, which can cause chaos in the financial markets," the Mainichi newspaper wrote in an editorial Tuesday. "The route from public corporation to privatisation must be made clear, but so far, we have seen no signposts," it said. No new nationwide mail delivery entrants have appeared, most likely due to the rule by the Posts Ministry requiring that 99,000 new postboxes be set up nationwide, a number equivalent to 60 percent of the existing postboxes. As of Tuesday, only five motorcycle-based parcel delivery firms had applied to provide services in limited regions in which postboxes were not required. Some also wondered if a privatised corporation would continue its massive purchase of government bonds. Together, the postal savings and postal insurance schemes made up the largest holder of government bonds, holding 94 trillion of the 470 trillion yen in circulation by March 2002, said ministry official Daisuke Kitabayashi. Japan Post plans to maintain up to some 96 percent of its funds in domestic corporate and government bonds, and even if privatised, it would be done in a way to maintain its important role in financing government spending, he said. Masuhisa Kobayashi, fixed income analyst with Merrill Lynch, said the plan was fine as long as deflation, which raises the value of bonds, persists. If not, a privatised Japan Post might choose to move its massive investment funds elsewhere. "The investment plan seems very conservative right now," he said. "But if deflation ends, I think a very big problem will arise." mis-rn/ja/dv Japan-post-privatisation
