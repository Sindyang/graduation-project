Tunisia wants a special status with the European Union putting the north African country at "an intermediary stage between an associate and member", officials reported Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi as having said Tuesday. Ghannouchi made his statement at a working session with European Commission President Romano Prodi, who arrived Monday in Tunisia for a two-day visit, the officials said. The special status that Tunisia hopes to achieve is in line with the EU's Euro-Mediterranean partnership, Ghannouchi said. "We want a more solid, diverse and fruitful partnership (with the EU) to create a solidarity that can stand up to any test in any domain," he said. Ghannouchi recalled that Tunisia, which derives most of its foreign exchange revenues from tourism, had been hard hit by the aftershock of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. The situation had worsened with the global economic slowdown and because of the war in Iraq. Because of the negative outlook, Tunisia "needs firmer backing from the European Union, which is Tunisia's main trading partner, with a view to promoting its integration in the Euro-Mediterannean group," Ghannouchi said. Prodi, meanwhile, restated the EU's commitment to stronger ties with Tunisia and to helping the north African country to modernise its economy "in spite of the current climate, which will be very difficult for all the world's countries." Tunisia and the EU signed a partnership agreement in 1995, which came into effect in 1998. The accord was the first to be signed between the EU and a non-European, Mediterranean country. Prodi was on Monday awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Tunis, in honour of his career as an "academic, researcher and politician, and of his contribution to European construction and the rapprochement between the people on the two banks of the Mediterranean." Prodi is due to return to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon. pvr/kdz/nb Tunisia-EU-Prodi
