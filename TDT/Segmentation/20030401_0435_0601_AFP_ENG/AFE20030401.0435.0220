Romanian international striker Viorel Moldovan said Tuesday he is to leave French side Nantes at the end of the season. The 30-year-old Moldovan arrived on the Atlantic coast in July 2000 and his goals played a key role in helping the Canaries to the French first division title that season. But this season he has been struggling with injuries and out of favour, starting in only 10 games and scoring just four goals. "I've accepted that Nantes no longer want to keep me," said Moldovan, adding that he was hopeful he could find another club in France or move back to Switzerland where he previously played with Neuchatel and Grasshoppers. bur/ak/rw Fbl-FRA-Nantes-Moldovan
