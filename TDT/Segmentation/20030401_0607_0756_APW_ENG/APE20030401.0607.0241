The death toll in a coal mine explosion in northeastern China has risen to 21 with three miners still missing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. Investigators were still looking into the cause of Sunday's blast at the state-owned Mengjiagou coal mine in the city of Fushun, from which 21 other miners escaped, Xinhua said. Authorities have shut another 23 small coal mines around the city, a major industrial center in Liaoning province, about 650 kilometers (400 miles) east of Beijing. Fires, floods and explosions killed more than 5,000 people last year in China's coal mines, the world's deadliest. Many of the accidents have been blamed on a lack of fire fighting and ventilation equipment. Officials have repeatedly pledged to improve mine safety but accidents _ some killing scores of miners at a stroke _ continue to occur with tragic frequency.
