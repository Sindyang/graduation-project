Archaeologists have uncovered a broken pillar with a carving of a lotus flower at the site of a destroyed 16th century mosque claimed by both Hindus and Muslims, a government official said Tuesday. The underground discovery could bring them closer to solving the mystery of whether a mosque or temple first existed at the site, a government official said Tuesday. ``The finding of a pillar and a multilayered flooring suggests there exists a permanent structure beneath the soil,'' said R.M. Srivastava, the senior government administrator in the northern town of Ayodhya, where the site is located. ``At this point we can only say that remains of a permanent structure lay buried in the soil. It could be anything _ a temple, a mosque or even a kitchen structure,'' Srivastava told The Associated Press by telephone. The broken pillar has a lotus embedded on top, he said. The Babri Mosque was demolished by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, provoking nationwide riots that killed more than 2,000 people. Both Hindus and Muslims claim ownership of the religious site in Ayodhya, nearly 550 kilometers (345 miles) east of New Delhi. Hindus claim it was the birthplace of their chief God, Rama, and they want to build a temple on the site in his honor. Hindu hard-liners also say that a Mogul emperor had built the mosque after demolishing a Hindu temple, a claim for which the Muslims say there is no proof. The Allahabad High Court in Lucknow, the capital of northern Uttar Pradesh state, is recording evidence in the title dispute. Earlier this month, the court asked government archaeologists to excavate and report within a month whether ruins of an ancient Hindu structure lie beneath the site of the demolished mosque. India's Supreme Court on Monday rejected a government plea to lift a ban on Hindu religious activity near the site of the Babri Mosque. The court said the government must wait for the Allahabad High Court to rule on whether Hindus or Muslims have a right to the land in Ayodhya.
