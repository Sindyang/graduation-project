India and Vietnam are seeking ways to bolster their bilateral trade, which now amounts to US$370 million a year, the Vietnamese foreign minister said Tuesday. Speaking to Indian business leaders, visiting Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien said India should fully tap into Vietnam's market of 80 million consumers and treat his country as a gateway to Southeast Asia and East Asia. Indian investment in Vietnam totaled US$125 million last year, mainly in sugar production, electric power generation, edible oil and plastics. Nien said some of the ways of boosting bilateral trade that the two nations were considering included extending credit to exporters, establishing quicker payment mechanisms, and jointly promoting trade. Vietnam is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is seeking to forge a free-trade zone with India similar to the one being planned with China. Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand are the other ASEAN members. India's exports to ASEAN nations totaled US$3.2 billion in 2001-2002, while ASEAN member countries shipped around US$6 billion in exports to India, international consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. said in a recent study. On Monday, Nien met India's President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and presided over an India-Vietnam Joint Commission meeting with his Indian counterpart, Yashwant Sinha. Nien arrived in India Sunday and was scheduled to leave later Tuesday.
