The field is suddenly awash with billions to combat bioterrorism, and much more to come under President George W. Bush's Project BioShield plan. Yet the bio buildup troubles many scientists and arms control experts. It can't be good to train more researchers in the black art of bioterror, they say, because in order to defeat new classes of deadly agents _ including genetically engineered ones _ scientists must first construct them.

The activity is proof that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has learned how to achieve the same kind of success in its international ventures as it has in thousands of stores across the United States. Wal-Mart, which grew up in small-town America, is increasingly dependent on foreign expansion as it faces slowing growth at home. BC-LA-FEA-FIN--Mexico-Wal-Mart Goes Global. By Traci Carl.

So Detroit automakers are creating cars specifically for the limited but expanding armored vehicle market. Ford Motor Co.'s new Lincoln Town Car BPS _ the BPS stands for Ballistic Protection Series _ will be available in late summer for $140,000. The armor-covered vehicle is designed to provide protection from powerful handgun and high-powered rifle blasts. BC-NA-FEA-FIN--US-Armored Vehicles. By John Porreto. AP Photos NY868-870. Wednesday, April 2 &lt; ^ Panda-loan program, aiming at conservation, brings symbol of China to the world's zoos &lt; WOLONG NATURE RESERVE, China _ Pandas have long been one of the most recognizable and marketable symbols of China, the only place in the world where they live outside captivity. For years, the Chinese government has been lending pandas out to zoos around the world, charging fees of up to US$1.2 million annually and spending the revenues on research, breeding and protection in the wild. China retains ownership and claims any babies, usually requiring that adults be returned within 10 years and cubs by age 3. BC-AS-FEA-GEN--US-Pandas Inc. By Audra Ang. AP Photos NY360-367. Thursday, April 3 &lt; ^ Africa's hunger crisis could persist for generations, aid groups warn &lt; CHIBOMBO, Zambia _ About 38 million Africans are threatened by starvation this year from a food crisis that relief workers predict could last for generations because of AIDS. Across the continent, relideef workers say the devastation from AIDS is worsening the effects of poverty, war, bad governance, corruption and erratic weather to cripple the ability to recover from famine.

One way to find out is to take an off-season drive through southwest Ireland. After the initial disorientation of maneuvering in the left lane, Ireland turns out to be a wonderful place to do your own driving. The good signage makes navigation easy, and the scenery is varied and often wildly beautiful. BC-EU-FEA-TRV--Ireland-Touring by Car. By David Tomlin.

Today, the elephants are gone, Pilok is a virtual ghost town and her beloved husband has died. But ``Auntie Glen,'' as everyone calls her, has stayed on to start a small, idyllic resort to help the villagers in this still remote, now impoverished region.

Sunday, April 6 &lt; ^ Despite heightened security, smugglers step up efforts at official U.S.-Mexico border crossings &lt; SAN DIEGO _ America's efforts to make it tougher for illegal immigrants, drug traffickers and terrorists to cross even remote parts of the border have brought smugglers back to formal border crossings. More cars, trucks and big rigs crammed with drugs are trying to slip across, trying to overwhelm customs inspectors. For every load caught, countless others slip through undetected.

These ``tourist attractions'' are on offer in Bosnia's war-scarred capital more than seven years after the end of the worst bloodshed in Europe in 60 years. Claiming to be the first guide to be licensed in the independent state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zijad Jusufovic promotes ``Mission Impossible'' tours by foot or bus.

The rain forests, pristine beaches, lush green valleys and volcanic areas here are home to five percent of all the known species of wildlife on earth, and about 25 percent of those species are protected in wildlife reserves or national parks.

With BC-LA-TRV--Costa Rica-Wildlife-Tips ^ Despite problems, analysts say future looking brighter for U.S. ski industry &lt; BEAVER CREEK, Colorado _ The future is looking brighter for skiing, a sport once seen as facing extinction with the passing of the baby boom generation and the sale of the last expensive condominium. Despite low or late snowfall and an economic decline, the numbers of skiers have held up in recent years, and resorts have branched into everything from ski rental shops to restaurants to get a bigger slice of the pie.
