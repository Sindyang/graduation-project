Ukrainian miners launched their third hunger strike in a month demanding the government pay millions of dollars in back wages, news reports said Tuesday. Twelve leaders of the Ukrainian Miners' Independent Trade Union in the coal-rich eastern Donbass region staged the strike in the head office of the Pavlohraduhol state holding company in Dnipropetrovsk, 480 kilometer (300 miles) east of Kiev, the Interfax news agency reported. The miners are demanding some 65 million hryvna (US$12,264,000) in wages that have not been paid for several months, and higher monthly pay, Interfax quoted Mykola Voloshyn, deputy head of the union as saying. Fourteen miners ended their hunger strike at the Bendyuzka mine in the western Lviv region last month after the government promised to meet their demands. Meanwhile, one miner died after a layer of rock collapsed some 459 meters (1506 feet) underground Monday at the Bendyuzka mine in the western Lviv region, the Emergency Situations Ministry said in a statement. The cause of the accident is being investigated. Miners earn about 560 hryvna (US$105) monthly, and work in mines considered among the world's deadliest due to a high concentration of methane gas, insufficient funds to upgrade equipment and frequent safety violations. Some 60 miners have died in accidents this year; more than 3,700 have died since 1991. (am/tv/mb)
