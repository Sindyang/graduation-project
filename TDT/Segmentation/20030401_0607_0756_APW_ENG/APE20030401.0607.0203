Four Russian soldiers were killed and one wounded in a mine explosion Tuesday in Ingushetia, the Russian republic bordering Chechnya, the Russian Defense Ministry said. A reconnaissance unit was sweeping a road near the Ingush village of Ali-Yurt along the route of an army convoy when one of its dogs discovered a mine, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a ministry spokesman. When a team of sappers approached the explosive device, it detonated, killing four soldiers and injuring another, the report said. Mine explosions are a common feature of the war in Chechnya, where rebels routinely lay explosive devices along the routes of military convoys. The mines claim daily casualties and force Russian troops to conduct painstaking sweeps ahead of any vehicles. Ingushetia has absorbed thousands of refugees from the war in Chechnya, but has largely avoided spillover violence from the conflict next door. (ee/mb)
