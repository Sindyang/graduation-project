Lens midfielder Antoine Sibierski is confident of joining English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur next season, a report said Tuesday. ``If I go to England there is one team that I really like at the moment,'' France Football Magazine quoted him as saying. ``I like Tottenham and I like their coach Glenn Hoddle, who knows French soccer very well.'' Sibierski, 28, is a talented attacking midfielder blessed with an eye for goal. He has notched 10 goals for Division One side Lens this season, and managed a career best 17 strikes for Nantes three years ago. He feels he can succeed at London-based Tottenham and is confident of eventually replacing Tottenham's veteran playmaker Teddy Sheringham, who is 38 years old. ``I am watching Tottenham very closely because there is a player there, Teddy Sheringham, who could be retiring soon,'' Sibierski said. ``We have a lot in common in the way we play which is what makes me hopeful of joining this club.'' Sibierski has a clause in his contract which states that Lens cannot block a transfer if another club offers him 5 million euros (US$5.45 million) or more. Meanwhile, Lens forward Daniel Moreira said both Tottenham and defending Premier League champions Arsenal, also based in London, were keen on signing him. ``They have both been watching me for a while,'' Moreira said. ``I would prefer to join a London club.'' Lens is in place in 10th place in the French first division. Tottenham Hotspur, nicknamed ``Spurs'', is in 10th spot in the Premier League. Spurs coach Hoddle enjoyed a brief spell playing for Monaco in the late 1980's. (jp-jc)
