Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday welcomed foreign ministers of the Rio Group to the Kremlin, saying that their visit should help bolster cooperation between Russia and Latin America. ``The Rio Group is one of the most representative and authoritative international organizations, and the most authoritative one in Latin America,'' Putin said at the start of talks with the Rio Group's troika, which is made up of the foreign ministers of Peru, Brazil and Costa Rica. He said that the troika's visit signalled ``the growing cooperation between Russia and Latin America.'' ``Our economic cooperation hasn't yet reached a high level, but we have been developing political dialogue and cooperation in confronting global challenges, such as terrorism,'' Putin said. ``I strongly hope that your visit to Moscow will give a strong impulse to the development of cooperation with the entire Latin America.'' Peru's Foreign Minister Allan Wagner said that the 19-nation Rio Group was eager to develop closer ties with Russia. ``We highly assess your government's initiative in holding this meeting,'' Wagner said, adding that the first political consultations between Russia and the Rio Group offer a ``historic opportunity.''
