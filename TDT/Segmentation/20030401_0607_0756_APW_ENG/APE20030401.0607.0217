Etched in Zackie Achmat's memory are the last choking grunts of a friend dying of AIDS, a disease he will likely die of if he doesn't take antiretroviral drugs. Achmat perhaps the most outspoken leader of a civil disobedience campaign that seeks to force the government to supply the drugs. He vowed Tuesday to intensify the fight. The HIV-positive law student reiterated his vow never to take the drugs until the government makes them generally available. Diagnosed in 1990, Achmat, 41, is leading a new wave of activism to help South Africa's 4.7 million HIV infected people _ one in 9 _ get AIDS drugs, even at the cost of his own life. His medical insurance will pay for antiretrovirals, but he will not take them till they are available to the general population. His commitment caught the attention of former President Nelson Mandela last year who visited Achmat at his home. Praising him as a role model and disciplined member of the ruling African National Congress, Mandela vowed to take his fight to government. Achmat believes the former president is ``doing all he can.'' This is not Achmat's first battle with the South African state. As a young anti-apartheid activist, he was detained without trial five times. Still an ANC member, he is taking on the very people he stood should to shoulder with during the struggle. His group, the Treatment Action Campaign has chosen civil disobedience, a popular anti-apartheid weapon, to pressure the government. The TAC has grown into a mass movement, from a small group that began smuggling generic drugs into the country three years go to help fight opportunistic infections. It won a groundbreaking case last year when the Constitutional Court ordered the government to supply antiretroviral drugs to public hospitals and clinics. Negotiations between government, labor and concerned organizations on how to effect the court ruling, ground to a halt, fueling the fire of frustration and giving birth to the civil disobedience campaign. Soon after a fiery confrontation last week when Achmat verbally abused the health minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the government indicated a desire to resume talks. Achmat and about 160 activists waved placards and chanted, ``murderer'' and ``Manto go to jail'' as she tried to address a public health conference. He later apologized for the outburst but added: ``I can't apologize for calling her a murderer because it is an uncomfortable fact that can be substantiated.'' The TAC claims government inaction leads to about 600 AIDS-related deaths a day. Last month, Achmat and hundreds of activists kicked off their civil disobedience campaign by filing manslaughter charges against the minister and her Trade and Industry counterpart, Alec Erwin. Tshabalala-Msimang condemned Achmat's behavior but recognized his right to protest. ``Through its disobedience campaign, the TAC spreads malicious lies that government 'had the resources to take action to reduce the prices of HIV/AIDS medicines' but had failed to do so,'' she said. ``This year government will move swiftly into implementing the Medicine and Related Substances Control Amendment Act to give our country better options in accessing affordable quality medicines,'' she added. Meanwhile, Achmat said he is sick of ``begging, cajoling, charming and arguing before government'' while his friends die. ``I am taking vitamins, antidepressants, TB prophylactics and nutrients ... but I need antiretrovirals now,'' he said. Since August 2002 Achmat has had two chest infections, peripheral neuropathy _ a degenerative nerve disorder _ chronic sinusitis and recurrent thrush. He draws strength from the dedication of fellow activists and their belief that like the anti-apartheid heroes who came before them, they will triumph. ``TAC will win because we act in good faith. We will sit down with government for as long as it takes,'' Achmat said. ^ (es-sv)
