Vice President Dick Cheney has postponed an April trip to China, Japan and South Korea to stay close to the White House during the Iraq war. ``This is not the right time so we're going to postpone the trip for a later date,'' his spokeswoman, Jennifer Millerwise, said Monday. She noted that President George W. Bush put off a trip to Africa in January for the same reason. Cheney was scheduled to spend two weeks in Asia, plus a brief stop in Hawaii. ``It's an important region and we'll need significant time to accomplish our objectives,'' Millerwise said. ``We want to do it when we have the time'' for a lengthy trip.
