Libya began airlifting relief supplies to Iraq via Syria Tuesday to help people affected by the U.S.-led war on Iraq, the Libyan Embassy said. The first plane carrying 40 tons of food and medical supplies arrived at Damascus Airport early Monday, one of 15 shipments expected to arrive in Syria within the next week. The relief supplies were ``a gift from the Libyan people to the Iraqi people,'' the Libyan statement said. It said the supplies will be loaded onto trucks at Damascus Airport and shipped overland to Iraq. It did not elaborate. Libya, like most Arab countries, opposes the U.S. and British military campaign against Iraq. ^ (zk-pfg) &lt;
