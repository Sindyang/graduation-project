Madonna has decided to withdraw the violent, anti-war video for her new single ``American Life'' out of respect for the troops fighting in Iraq. In a statement posted on her Web site Monday, the singer said the video was filmed before the war started and was not appropriate to air at this time. ``Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video,'' Madonna said. The video for the title track of a new album shows Madonna wearing military garb next to dancers in camouflage on a fashion runway. At one point, a grenade is thrown in the direction of a lookalike of President George W. Bush. Scenes are intercut with images of war. The video also shows Madonna trapped in a bathroom stall, where she uses a knife to carve ``protect me'' on the wall. Warner Bros. Records will be releasing Madonna's new album April 22. The video was scheduled to premiere on VH-l on Friday. The single ``American Life'' has just been released to radio. _ _ _ On the Net: www.madonna.com
