News flash: U.S. President W. George Bush and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein give historic hug marking the end of the war! Another flash: Pakistan's president to visit New Delhi and meet Indian PM after ban on air travel between hostile neighbors lifted. If only. The Times of India used April Fool's Day to take jabs at Bush, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf. The phony picture of Bush and Saddam showed a man releasing a peace dove with a huge fireball providing the backdrop. Scoops in the pullout also included fictionalized items about Australian cricket stars flunking drug tests and forfeiting the World Cup title to India; and pollution levels in the capital dropping to near-zero levels. The Musharraf blurb comes at a time when relations between the nuclear rivals have touched a new low with travel links severed between them since last January and no government-level talks since Musharraf visited India in 2001. ``Musharraf is scheduled to attend a large luncheon hosted by Indian President Kalam at Ashoka Hotel,'' read the phony snippet on the front of its entertainment section. ``According to sources, the PM is keen to host a more intimate dinner for Musharraf and his wife.''
