The French Parliament on Tuesday adopted the government's plan to sell more than half of its controlling 54.4 percent stake in carrier Air France. The vote in the Senate, which followed approval two weeks ago in the National Assembly, calls on the government to sell 35 percent of the company's stock when market conditions are good, leaving the state holding just under 20 percent of the carrier. The project requires a presidential decree to take effect. With the war in Iraq and the weak economy depressing markets, officials said they would wait for an improvement in stock prices before moving ahead with the plan. The sale was not expected before the second half of the year. ``The government doesn't intend at all to give away its interests ... and this operation will not take place until market conditions allow,'' said Transport Minister Gilles de Robien. The plan is bitterly opposed by the airline's powerful trade unions, which fear it will lead to losses of benefits and jobs. Earlier this month, several unions led a one-day strike to protest the proposal. De Robien has sought to ease union concerns, arguing that once the privatization program was complete employees would hold a 10 percent to 20 percent stake in the airline. The company's 70,000 employees would also retain their benefits as state workers for two years after the sale. The privatization of Air France would be the first by the center-right government of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which has been eager to sell several state holdings in the hopes of improving their performance and helping to meet European Union deficit standards.
