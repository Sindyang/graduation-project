Political parties on Tuesday agreed on a consensus candidate to become mayor of Belgium's second largest city after a corruption scandal forced the whole Antwerp city government to step down last month. Patrick Janssens, who stepped down as leader of the governing Dutch-speaking Socialist party to become mayor, has received the backing of the VLD liberal party, which had pushed its own candidate until Monday. Under the agreement to keep the Socialists in charge of city hall, the VLD won more power over the city's law and order department and won assurances a crisis manager will be appointed to revamp the city administration. Janssens will assemble his executive over the coming days before he can be sworn in as new mayor. Over the past month, a corruption scandal undermined the port city's government and was highlighted when Socialist mayor Leona Detiege and her 10-member council stepped down when it became clear they had spent thousands of taxpayers euros (dollars) on clothing, shoes, birth announcements, glasses and other personal items. Accusations further centered on alleged corruption involving a city government contract for street advertising. On top of that, the city's police chief was charged with embezzlement and forgery. The scandal comes a month ahead of general elections, in which this port city of 500,000 will be a focal point since the extreme right wing party Vlaams Blok is the city's biggest. The party, forced into opposition by the other main parties, is the only one not involved in the scandal. Vlaams Blok leader Filip De Winter has asked for a government-appointed commissioner to be appointed to lead the city until elections. ^ rac/cb &lt;
