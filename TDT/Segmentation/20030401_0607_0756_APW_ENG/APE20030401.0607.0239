An Israeli court on Tuesday threw out an indictment against an Israeli Arab lawmaker charged with organizing illegal trips to Syria. The Nazareth court agreed with legislator Azmi Bishara's lawyers who said he could not be tried because at the time of the alleged offense he enjoyed parliamentary immunity. However, the court ruled that two of his assistants would still face charges. Bishara and his aides were charged with organizing trips for Palestinians to Syria, which is technically in a state of war with Israel. Bishara said his aides should have been cleared of charges as well, since they acted on his instructions. The two aides face a year in prison, if convicted. At the start of the trial, Bishara said organizing family reunions for elderly Israeli Arabs, separated from their family following Israel's creation in 1948, is a humanitarian act that should be supported, rather than condemned. The lawmaker still faces a second trial on charges of incitement to violence over remarks praising Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas in a speech in 2001. He is the first Israeli legislator to be stripped of his parliamentary immunity for public comments. Bishara says that he never advocated violence. The incitement charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in jail. Israelis were also shocked when on one of his trips to Syria, Bishara sat next to the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, at a memorial service for Syria's late President Hafez Assad. Prior to the January elections in Israel, the Central Election Committee ruled that Bishara was ineligible to run for parliament, citing his alleged incitement. However the Supreme Court overruled the committee and Bishara was re-elected at the head of his party, the National Democratic Assembly. ^ gr-kl &lt;
