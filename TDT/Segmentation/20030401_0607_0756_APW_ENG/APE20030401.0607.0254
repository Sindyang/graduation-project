Leaders of seven small European Union nations gathered Tuesday in hopes of forging a common plan for thwarting larger members' hopes of gaining powers from a new European Union constitution. Leaders from Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and Belgium were highlighting a potentially divisive debate on how the EU should be run once it absorbs 10 new members next year. Derisively termed ``The Seven Dwarfs'' in German media this week, the small EU members have traditionally had equal standing alongside Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, thanks mostly to veto rights that enable even the smallest member to block a decision in key policy-making areas. But proposed reforms, now being debated by the 105-member European Convention that is drafting an EU constitution, could end vetoes, effectively giving larger countries a bigger say in an EU of 25 members. On top of that, France and Germany are lobbying for a full-time EU president who would serve a five-year term. The proposed president would have the job of making the EU more effective and more visible on the world stage. This new position would replace the long-standing practice of rotating the EU presidency among all member governments every six months. Small EU nations fear ending the rotation system will reduce their influence in shaping EU policy and leave them sidelined. The European Convention is debating, in particular, the abolition of vetoes in such sensitive matters as EU farm reforms and foreign policy. Under the chairmanship of former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, it is also defining what powers should remain the preserve of national governments, and which should be exercised at the EU level. Small nations want to keep a hand in such matters as trade and foreign affairs. They generally favor a strong European Commission, the executive at the heart of the union. Its members draft and monitor compliance with EU legislation and act as a guardian of sorts over the rights of small EU members. Ahead of the meeting, however, it was unclear if all seven could forge a coalition. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg generally hope to see an EU with strong centralized powers. Ireland and Finland oppose such federalist visions. Giscard d'Estaing has hinted he would like more time to complete the constitution, which is supposed to be adopted by the governments of all 15 members by the end of the year. (cb/rw)
