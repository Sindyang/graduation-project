The human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday renewed its call for Myanmar's military government to release political prisoners, which it said number more than 1,200. The London-based group's call came a day after a similar plea from the special U.N. envoy to Myanmar on human rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro. The envoy told the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on Monday that the pace of prisoner releases, begun in January 2001, had slowed in recent months. He said the government had implemented several moves to safeguard human rights, but that it might be using prisoner releases as a bargaining tool in its talks with the opposition National League for Democracy. ``If this is true, it is unacceptable and cruel, especially for elderly prisoners, some of whom are in their 70s and whose poor health is aggravated by long and harsh prison sentences,'' he said in a prepared statement. Amnesty International sent researchers to Myanmar for the first time earlier this year, and the group said that since then it ``welcomed some limited improvements in the human rights situation,'' but was also disappointed the junta ``has not released prisoners who are ill, elderly, or are imprisoned with their young children.'' Myanmar, also know as Burma, has been ruled by a military government since 1962. In 1988, the armed forces suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations and has ruled by decree since. The opposition National League for Democracy party won a 1990 general election, but the military barred it from taking power, instead embarking on a campaign of political repression. The junta began closed-door reconciliation talks with NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi in late 2000, but they have had no significant result aside from the piecemeal release of some political prisoners. The talks are now at a virtual standstill.
