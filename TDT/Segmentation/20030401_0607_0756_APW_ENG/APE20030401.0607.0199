The coalition campaign in Iraq has reached a phase of ``steady advance,'' but more troops and civilians will die as fighting continues, Prime Minister Tony Blair's office said Tuesday. ``Now we are in the phase of steady advance and you saw signs of that steady advance yesterday, moving in on Basra, wearing down the opposition there and elsewhere, beginning the process of changing the military profile in those areas where we are in control,'' Blair's official spokesman said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. The spokesman said the decision by some British forces to switch from hard helmets to berets on Tuesday reflected growing confidence in their position. ``No one is under any illusions. There will be further difficulties, there will be further loss of life both to military personnel and, despite all the best efforts, of civilians, as we saw in the tragic incident at the checkpoint yesterday,'' the spokesman said, referring to the killing of seven Iraqi women and children by U.S. soldiers near Najaf. Earlier, a British minister said the checkpoint shooting was a tragedy, but doesn't compare with the deliberate killing of civilians by Iraqi forces. ``This is a tragedy that's happened as a result of the heat of war, as opposed to the callous murder and slaughter of the Iraqi people by Saddam Hussein,'' Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told Sky News television. British military officials and witnesses last Friday reported that Iraqi forces fired mortars and machine guns at around 1,000 Iraqi civilians trying to flee the southern city of Basra, which British troops have surrounded for more than a week. Many of the civilians were forced to retreat. One woman was reported badly injured by shrapnel, but there were no reports of civilian deaths in the incident. Britain has 45,000 personnel, including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led war on Iraq. Britain's Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed Monday in southern Iraq while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing the British death toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry said the soldier's family had been informed, but gave no further information. (ej-mm-rb)
