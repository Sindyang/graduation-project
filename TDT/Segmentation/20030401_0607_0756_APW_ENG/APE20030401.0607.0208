The European Union head office on Tuesday called the killing of at least seven Iraqi women and children by U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint in southern Iraq ``a horrible tragedy.'' ``No matter how advanced the technology in the hands of soldiers ... there is no such thing as an intelligent war,'' said European Commission spokesman Reijo Kemppinen. He also appealed to both sides to respect the Geneva convention on the fair and humane treatment of prisoners of war. (rw-pa)
