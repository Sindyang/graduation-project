Israeli warplanes flew over southern Lebanon Tuesday, drawing fire from Hezbollah guerrillas that resulted in an anti-aircraft missile landing in northern Israel, according to officials on both sides. The missile did not explode and no one was injured. Two Israeli jet fighters violated Lebanon's airspace by flying at a medium-altitude over the market town of Nabatiyeh and the coastal cities of Tyre and Sidon, Lebanese security officials in south Lebanon said. Hezbollah's anti-aircraft batteries fired on the Israeli jets but missed, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Palestinian guerrillas in Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp on Sidon's outskirts, joined with volleys of automatic fire directed at the jets. The militant Hezbollah group said in Beirut that its air defense unit confronted the Israeli planes over the Bint Jbeil border region at 10.35 a.m. (0735 GMT) and again over ``eastern sector areas'' at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT). In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Hezbollah fired anti-aircraft shells at Israel's northern towns. An army spokesman said an unexploded missile landed near a school in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona, but no one was injured. Since Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon in 2000, Israeli military aircraft have routinely flown over Lebanon on apparent reconnaissance missions, sometimes breaking the sound barrier with loud sonic booms and drawing fire from Lebanese army and Hezbollah gunners. The Lebanese government and the United Nations have called the Israeli overflights a violation of Lebanese territory. Hezbollah, which is on the U.S. State Department list of terrorist organizations but is recognized in Lebanon as a resistance group, is known to possess thousands of inaccurate 127mm rockets with a range of up to 17 miles (27 kilometers). ^ (hd-pfg) &lt;
