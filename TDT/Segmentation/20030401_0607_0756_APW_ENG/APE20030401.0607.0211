Leaders of seven small EU nations meet Tuesday looking for common ground in efforts to thwart plans by larger members to boost their powers through a European Union constitution now being drafted. The gathering of the leaders from Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and Belgium points to what may be a contentious debate on how the EU _ which will absorb 10 new members in 2004 _ is to be run in the future. Derisively termed ``the Seven Dwarfs'' in German media this week, the seven small EU members have traditionally had equal standing alongside Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, thanks mostly to veto rights enabling even the smallest member to block a decision in key policy-making areas. But proposed reforms, now being debated by the 105-member European Convention that is drafting an EU constitution, could end vetoes, effectively giving larger countries a bigger say ahead in an EU of 25 or more members. On top of that, France and Germany are lobbying for a full-time EU president who would serve a five-year term and have the job of making the EU more effective and more visible on the world stage. This new position would replace the long-standing practice of rotating the EU presidency among all member governments every six months. Small EU nations fear ending the rotation system will reduce their influence in shaping EU policy and leave them sidelined. The European Convention is debating, in particular, the abolition of vetoes in such sensitive matters as EU farm reforms and foreign policy. Under the chairmanship of former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, it is also defining what powers should remain the preserve of national governments, and which should be become exercised at the EU level. Small nations want to keep a hand in such matters as trade and foreign affairs. They generally favor a strong European Commission, the executive at the heart of the union which drafts and monitors compliance with EU legislation and acts as a guardian of sorts over the rights of small EU members. Ahead of the meeting, it was unclear if the seven could forge a coalition. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg generally hope to see an EU with strong centralized powers. Ireland and Finland oppose such federalist visions, preferring to have more powers on national level. The debate on revamping the EU powers and institutions began in February, 2002, amid great hopes of settling long-standing arguments over how to give the union more teeth and make it more effective all around. EU nations have been at odds for two decades over to forge a common foreign and security policies. The U.S.-led war in Iraq has complicated that debate, sowing European divisions at a moment when convention members are trying to write constitutional articles on an EU foreign policy. Giscard d'Estaing has hinted he would like more time to complete the constitution, which is supposed to be adopted by the governments of all 15 members by the end of the year. He plans to meet with the EU leaders at a mid-April summit in Athens during which the 10 candidate nations are scheduled to sign their accession treaties. In the Iraq crisis, France and Germany have led the anti-war camp, while Britain, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have generally sided with the United States. (cb/rw)
