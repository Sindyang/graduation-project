American soldiers on the road to Baghdad fought bloody street-to-street battles with Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein while tense troops in southern Iraq shot and killed seven women and children when the driver of a van failed to stop at a checkpoint. The civilian deaths, following days of ambush attacks, may damage coalition efforts to win over the Iraqi people. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala to the southwest, and circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. Buildings in the capital shuddered in some of the strongest blasts since the air war began March 20. The night sky glowed orange and smoke billowed from the Old Palace presidential compound. Rumbling explosions could be heard throughout the morning. Among the targets, U.S. officials said allied planes struck a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say Saddam's son Odai runs a torture center. Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said five people were killed and 25 others wounded in bombing in Baghdad Tuesday morning alone. U.S.-led troops have relentlessly targeted Republican Guard positions in and around Baghdad in preparation for the war's likely decisive battle. U.S. forces battled some of these fighters from Iraq's best-trained units Monday in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Baghdad. Troops seized tons of ammunition and hundreds of weapons at the local headquarters of Saddam's Baath Party, along with maps showing Iraqi military positions and the expected route of the U.S. attack. To the south, Marines traded fire Tuesday with hundreds of Iraqi fighters in the town of Diwaniyah. Other units fought to isolate Najaf in an ongoing effort to protect U.S. supply lines. A series of ruse attacks by militants in civilian clothes _ including a suicide bombing that killed four soldiers over the weekend _ have made the trek north increasingly dangerous for coalition troops. Monday's fatal shooting happened at a U.S. Army checkpoint near Najaf, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Saturday's suicide attack. Coalition officials said soldiers motioned for an approaching van to stop, but the driver ignored them. Troops fired warning shots, to no avail, before shooting into the engine, then into the passenger compartment as a last resort, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command, which oversees the war in Iraq. The van was carrying 13 women and children, and seven were killed, the statement said. But The Washington Post, whose reporter is traveling with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five small children. The newspaper described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive crammed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. In its account of the shooting, the Post quoted an Army captain as saying the checkpoint crew did not fire the warning shots quickly enough. Central Command said initial reports indicated the soldiers had acted properly. A spokesman blamed the deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice of using women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing about this is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us to be on our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. ``So the blood of this incident is on the regime of Saddam Hussein.'' Thorp said another Iraqi was killed Tuesday in a similar incident, at a checkpoint near the south-central town of Shatra. U.S.-led troops moving north toward Baghdad have focused much of their energy on rooting out fighters with the ruling Baath Party militia and the Fedayeen _ Saddam's most trusted paramilitary militia. But they have also distributed rations to civilians, and they say winning over the Iraqi people is a priority. In Diwaniyah, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad, Marines fought with hundreds of Iraqi fighters who fired on them from inside buildings. At least 20 Iraqis were taken prisoner. Some simply surrendered. Meanwhile, Iraq publicly denied a report that Saddam's family had fled the country. A statement on Iraqi TV called the report ``a rumor circulated by the U.S. Defense Department.'' Iraqi TV late Monday aired footage of Saddam and his sons Odai and Qusai, but there was no way of determining when the video was shot. Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. intelligence sources have been unable to confirm that Saddam survived the March 19 strike on a bunker where he was believed to be staying but said, ``That doesn't mean he's dead.'' U.S. President George W. Bush warned Monday that Saddam ``may try to bring terror to our shores.'' The United States is acting to prevent such threats, he said, while offering assurances that the war remains on track. In northern Iraq, commanders said forces searching the recently captured compound of Muslim extremist group Ansar al-Islam found documents, computer discs and other material belonging to Arab fighters _ including suspected militants living in the United States. The Bush administration has longed claimed Ansar is linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network, but there has been no indication it has ties to Saddam's regime. Elsewhere, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's weapon while being questioned, Central Command spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Charles Owen said Tuesday. Near the southern port of Basra, warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht and another ship, Navy officials said Tuesday. The official casualty count for Americans stands at 44 dead, seven captured and 16 missing. The British death toll rose to 26 with the death of a soldier Monday in southern Iraq. Iraqi officials have given no estimate of military casualties but have said at least 430 civilians have been killed and thousands wounded. British officials say 8,000 Iraqis have been taken prisoner so far.
