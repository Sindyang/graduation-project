The government will be able to revoke British citizenship from immigrants who ``seriously prejudice'' the country's interest under new laws that came into force on Tuesday. There is speculation that the controversial legislation will be used against radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, with at least one Labor Party lawmaker calling for his expulsion from Britain. The change to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act is part of a plan to stem the flow of asylum seekers into Britain and affects people with dual nationality. ``If we are to welcome those that aspire to and qualify for British citizenship, we must also ensure that those who acquire it by deception or prove to be abusing the privilege of that citizenship by acting against the U.K.'s vital interests are not able to retain it,'' Home Secretary David Blunkett said. ``That is why ... I will prepare a case to take action against anyone who has acted in a way which is totally incompatible with holding British citizenship.'' Labor lawmaker Andrew Dismore said that al-Masri, who has been banned from preaching by a government body at a mosque in north London because of his ``extreme and political'' statements, should be ``a prime candidate under these new powers, if not at the very top of the list.'' Home Office minister Beverley Hughes said in March that Hamza was ``being very, very closely monitored.'' The Egyptian-born activist, 44, has condemned the invasion of Iraq as a ``war against Islam,'' and claimed the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States were a Jewish plot. He has also told worshippers that the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed by God because it was carrying an Israeli Jew, American Christians and an Indian-born Hindu. ``He wants to turn Britain into a Taliban-style state and has no place in this country,'' said Dismore. ``He fulfills the criteria of this legislation for his nationality to be removed and then for him to be removed.'' The United States says al-Masri is a member of the Islamic Army of Aden, the organization that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen. The cleric is wanted in Yemen for allegedly orchestrating terrorist activities there, but as a British citizen is protected from extradition. Hamza came to Britain in 1980 and was granted British citizenship after marrying English national Valerie Traverso. If the authorities decide to take action, he will have the right to appeal. Other measures that came into effect on Tuesday are designed to stop failed asylum seekers delaying their removal from Britain by ``abusing'' the appeal system. They also crack down on illegal working by giving immigration officers new powers to enter and search business premises. Asylum applications in Britain reached record levels last year and the government has pledged to cut the numbers in half within seven months. The Home Office has said 110,700 people sought refugee status in Britain in 2002, a 20 percent rise on the previous year. Asylum seekers from Iraq and Zimbabwe accounted for nearly all the increase.
