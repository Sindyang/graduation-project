Indonesia's national carrier cut by half the number of flights to the Middle East starting Tuesday because the war in Iraq has hurt demand. The airline said it would reduce its flights to Riyadh, Dharan and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to four times a week, said Garuda Indonesia's commercial director, Bachrul Hakim. Hakim said the number of passengers to the Middle East has dropped by 30 percent since the start of the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, including a fall in the number of Indonesian Muslims making pilgrimages to Islamic holy cities. ``We are closely monitoring the situation. We cannot continue the flights if we are unable to cover operational costs,'' he said. Garuda's business has also been troubled by a deadly flu-like illness that has been spreading in parts of Asia. The airline reported a 20 percent drop in passengers to Singapore and China _ which have been hit by the illness _ but has yet to cut flights to those destinations. The airline is also still reeling from the Oct. 12 terrorist bombings in Bali, Indonesia, which killed more than 200 people, mostly foreign tourists.
