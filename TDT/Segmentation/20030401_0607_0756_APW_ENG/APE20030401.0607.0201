Construction giant Skanska AB said Tuesday it will eliminate 275 jobs because of a drop in demand for new office space in the Swedish capital. Skanska spokesman Peter Gimbe said the jobs being eliminated include 200 construction and 75 administrative positions. Skanska employs 15,000 people in Sweden and 75,000 worldwide. It owns and operates subsidiaries in more than 60 countries. The company builds everything from industrial facilities to sports stadiums to roads and bridges. It also offers facilities management and real estate services, as well as information technology for construction and real estate markets. _ _ _ On the Net: Skanska: http://www.skanska.com (mpm)
