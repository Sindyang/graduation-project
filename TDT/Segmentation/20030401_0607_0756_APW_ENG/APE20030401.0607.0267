Fearful that the isolation of 240 people in a Hong Kong building has not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials said Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. A rumor apparently circulated via e-mail that Hong Kong would be declared an ``infected city'' sent some residents scurrying out to stock up on food and other provisions, but officials said it was false and insisted there was no shortage of basic necessities in this wealthy territory. Residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to camps used by vacationers, one in the suburban New Territories and one on Hong Kong island, said Dr. Leung Pak-yin, deputy director of health. Leung said an ``environmental factor'' in the sealed-off building might be causing the disease to spread, but he did not elaborate in an evening statement he read out to reporters. There has been speculation a sewage leak might have spread the disease among residents of apartment units at one end of the 33-story building. Leung said health officials were still investigating but he did not take questions. The health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, was to hold a news conference later Tuesday night. Hong Kong officials said Tuesday an additional 75 people were hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, including 52 from the Amoy Gardens complex. It was not immediately clear how many of the new cases had come from Block E, which was sealed off Monday with barricades and police tape. Residents were told Monday they would have to stay inside for 10 days, with regular medical checkups and three free meals a day provided. A day later, they found out they were being moved, under a quarantine law dating to colonial days intended to halt the spread of infectious diseases. They will get checkups and free meals in the quarantine camps, Leung said, but it was not immediately clear what their living conditions will be like. Authorities had said previously that some 200 people were infected at Amoy Gardens, about half of them from the building that was sealed off. There was no updated figure for Amoy Gardens cases by late Tuesday. Panic spread in Hong Kong amid rumors that officials were about to declare it an ``infected city,'' sending shoppers rushing out to stock up on basic provisions. The rumor was reportedly spread by someone who sent out e-mails using the Web page design of a Chinese-language newspaper. Hong Kong officials scrambled to quash it _ making multiple phone calls to journalists and even sending text messages to their mobile phones. The newspaper, Ming Pao, did not immediately return a reporter's phone calls asking about the reported hacking on its Web site. Health Director Dr. Margaret Chan met with reporters to deny the rumor and added that Hong Kong has plenty of food and other goods, ``so there is no need for anybody to have a run.''
