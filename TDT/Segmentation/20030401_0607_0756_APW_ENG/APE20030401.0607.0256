The Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday knocked four years off the sentence of a man convicted of involvement in a 2001 racist attack at a Moscow street market that killed three people. Mikhail Volkov, 32, had his sentenced reduced from nine years to five years after the court dropped the charge that he had organized the killings, said Pavel Odintsov, spokesman for the Supreme Court. Volkov was convicted in November, along with three others who received three-year sentences for their involvement in the attack. The Supreme Court upheld the other sentences. In the Oct. 30, 2001, attack, several hundred skinheads armed with metal rods raided the Tsaritsyno street market in Moscow, targeting dark-skinned traders. They killed three men _ citizens of India and the ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan _ and injured 40 others. The attack highlighted the danger posed by Russia's extremist and neo-Nazi groups, which have targeted dark-skinned immigrants from poverty-stricken formerly Soviet Central Asia, the Caucasus Mountains region and other territories. In the wake of the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged police to pay more attention to preventing the spread of interethnic clashes and make stronger efforts to fight extremist groups.
