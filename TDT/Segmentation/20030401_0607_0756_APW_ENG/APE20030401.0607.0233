China's most prolific panda mother, Qing Qing, is pregnant again with at least one sibling to join the 12 cubs she has already given birth to, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. Qing Qing, who has been dubbed ``heroic mama'' for her talent in spawning offspring, showed signs of pregnancy recently after mating four times at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and Research Base in southwestern China, Xinhua said. She is expected to give birth in August. The 22-year-old has already produced four sets of twins and four single births since 1989. Fertility runs in her blood: Mother Mei Mei gave birth to nine panda cubs between 1980-1990. Pandas are among the world's most endangered species, a quandary made worse by their notoriously low rates of fertility and slow rates of reproduction. Chinese scientists say only about one in five female pandas are even capable of producing a fully developed ovum. Chinese researchers have turned to artificial insemination and even studies in cloning in hopes of producing future generations of what has come to be seen as an unofficial national mascot. About 1,000 giant pandas survive in the wild and 110 more live in captivity throughout the world.
