Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of a deadly flu-like illness, worried Asian governments Tuesday invoked emergency measures, including quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been held in isolation in their contaminated apartment building. At least 63 people have died since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, was reported in November in Southern China and then spread to three continents. An 83-year-old Hong Kong Tuesday became the latest victim of the disease, about which much remains a mystery to global health authorities. Officials said 240 residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to two camps, normally used for vacationers in the suburban New Territories and one on Hong Kong island. The building had been sealed off Monday amid fears that many people living there might be infected. Earlier officials said as many as 1,000 people who might have been exposed to SARS could be sent to four camps in undeveloped corners of the former British colony. In neighboring China, authorities urged physicians treating SARS cases to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer surgical masks. China's Foreign Ministry said British Prime Minister Tony Blair had postponed a planned trip to Beijing, but denied it was due to SARS fears. Thailand's government gave health officials the authority to quarantine arriving travelers suspected of having the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have yet to identify the disease that has sickened more than 1,600 globally and they are working hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms include fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Most victims have been in Asia. Hong Kong doctors say some have responded well to antibodies from others who recovered from the disease. In Singapore, nurses posted at Changi airport identified seven suspected cases during their first 20 hours of duty. They were screening about 35 flights a day from Vietnam, Hong Kong, China and Ontario province in Canada _ all hit by the disease. ``If we suspect a case or think a person is not feeling well we give them a mask and take them to hospital,'' said Albert Tjoeng, spokesman at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Australia on Tuesday announced its first case _ a man who had been in Singapore. He had recovered and the illness has not spread, health authorities said. In Canada, where a health emergency has been declared in Ontario province, Toronto authorities reported that at least two children had been hospitalized with the disease, and three others had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily banned shipping traffic between the Chinese mainland and the Matsu Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off China's southern coast _ because the islands' clinics wouldn't be able to cope with a major outbreak, the government said. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained at 13 Tuesday, while authorities issued more than 800 quarantine orders to people who had come into contact with patients. The Olympic Council of Asia decided to shift the site of its April 22-23 meeting from Vietnam, where four people have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official of the Thai National Olympic Council said. The World Economic Forum postponed a meeting of international business and government leaders that had been scheduled for April 14-15 in Beijing. The World Health Organization said Monday that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs continue to point to the coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth of all colds. In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong Kong apartment building seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official said. ``They are finding that the infections are in people living in apartments on top of each other, only in one area of this apartment block,'' virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters in Geneva. That differs from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong, where the disease spread when people who spent time on the ninth floor in late February were infected by a sick mainland Chinese medical professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have a vertical connection,'' Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes and sewage pipes, about drafts which move up and down _ that's pure speculation. These are hypotheses that are being looked into.'' Before the quarantine was imposed, many residents of the apartment building had fled in fear as dozens of people became sick, raising the possibility that SARS could spread further. The other 18 buildings in the complex were not sealed off despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were hit as badly. ``If isolation is effective to control the spread of the disease, we can say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung Ping-chung, an orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been monitoring the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens of staff have been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should be isolated?'' Leung said.
