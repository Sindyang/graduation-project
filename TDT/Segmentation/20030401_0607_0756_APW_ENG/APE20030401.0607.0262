Continuing its Mediterranean cruise through Euro 2004 qualifying, France has docked in the Sicilian capital for an encounter with Israel on Wednesday. The match is considered a home game for the Israelis, who are not permitted to play in their own country due to UEFA worries about security in the Middle East. While security will be high for the match, the game itself should be another easy victory for France, the defending champion. On Saturday, ``Les Bleus'' routed Malta 6-0 in Lens, improving slightly on the 4-0 win scored at the home stadium of the tiny island nation. In a slightly tougher test, France defeated Cyprus 2-1 in the eastern Mediterranean city of Nicosia in September. In all, France has managed four wins in four qualifiers thus far, earning 12 points and thus running away with the automatic berth they can secure by winning the group. Israel and Cyprus, tied for second with four points each, are in a fight for second place and a spot in the playoffs. ``A zero-risk situation doesn't exist, but at the moment we don't feel under any particular threat,'' said France general manager Gerard Enault. France's current status is a far cry from its sorry state after scoring no goals and earning no points in last year's defense of its 1998 World Cup title. Since that ragged performance in South Korea, the team's only losses have come in friendly matches. Yet coach Jacques Santini, who took over the French bench following the World Cup, insisted his side is wary of Israel. ``I said that we couldn't take the Maltese lightly and the same goes for the Israelis,'' Santini said. ``There are no easy games or opponents, and for proof, just look at the results from the last round of qualifying. Who would have said that Germany would draw with Lithuania? ``I'm certain that the Israelis will find extra motivation by the fact that they can't count on the support of their fans.'' Santini could have also mentioned a 3-2 victory that Israel scored against France in qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, which helped keep France out of the U.S.-based tournament. For Wednesday's match, Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane will once again wear the captain's armband for France, since Marcel Desailly is out with an injury. Zidane scored twice against Malta, breaking his yearlong scoring drought with the national team. Patrick Vieira, the man Zidane beat out for the armband honor, is expected to return from a knee injury that kept him out of the Malta contest. ``It's not painful anymore and I'm at the coach's disposal,'' the Arsenal captain said. Israel is coming off a 1-1 draw at Cyprus, where Omri Afek scored on a header in just the second minute. On Wednesday, an early goal may be the Israelis only shot at staying competitive. Israel coach Avraham Grant said two of his top players were doubtful with injuries: Racing Santander striker Yossi Benayoun and midfielder Avi Nimny. But those losses have not changed the coach's outlook. ``Only a win would be a good result,'' Grant said. ``Although everyone knows France is very strong.'' Some 1,000 security officials will be deployed for the match, including officers from the Israeli secret service. Tight security was already in place Tuesday. Reporters had to pass through two medal detectors at the Israeli team's hotel to speak with Grant and team captain Tal Banin. ``For us it's normal to see people with guns,'' Banin said. ``We're thinking only about the French team. We try to do our best all the time. We have to be optimists.'' ``It's not nice to see (the security), but we know there are people in the world who want to harm Israelis,'' said Banin, who once played for Brescia in Italy's Serie A. ``What will be will be.'' The coach said he wished the game could be played in Israel. ``Our fans deserve to see a team like France, but this is the situation and we have to play in Italy,'' Grant said. ``It's not good to let terror win. I understand UEFA's decision, but I don't accept it.'' About 500 Israeli fans, 2,000 French supporters and a couple thousand Italians were expected to turn out for the game. Although local organizer Alessandro Amato said he was afraid that ``the local fans have been scared off by all the security.'' France reportedly did not want to play the match at one point because of safety fears. But Zidane said his team had no trouble with the logistics: ``We had to travel anyway. I would say, that if there is a problem, it's more for them because they can't play at home.'' (asd-fd)
