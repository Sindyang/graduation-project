Fearful that the isolation of 240 people in a Hong Kong building has not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials said Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. Residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to camps used for holidays, one in the suburban New Territories and one on Hong Kong island, said Dr. Leung Pak-yin, deputy director of health. Leung said an ``environmental factor'' in the sealed-off building might be causing the disease to spread, but he did not elaborate in an evening statement he read out to reporters. There has been speculation a sewage leak might have spread the disease among residents of apartment units at one end of the 33-story building. Leung said health officials were still investigating but he did not take questions. The health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, was to hold a news conference later Tuesday night. Hong Kong officials said Tuesday an additional 75 people were hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, including 52 from the Amoy Gardens complex. It was not immediately clear how many of the new cases had come from Block E, which was sealed off Monday with barricades and police tape. Residents were told Monday they would have to stay inside for 10 days, with regular medical checkups and three free meals a day provided. They will get the same in the quarantine camps, Leung said, but it was not immediately clear what their living conditions will be like. Authorities had said previously that some 200 people were infected at Amoy Gardens, about half of them from the building that was sealed off. There was no updated figure for Amoy Gardens cases by late Tuesday. Hong Kong on Tuesday night reported another death of SARS patient, for 16 total here and at least 63 worldwide. Out of more than 1,600 SARS cases globally, 685 have been in Hong Kong. Separately, the Health Department said Tuesday a 30-year-old man with SARS symptoms had flown here from Bangkok aboard Thai Airways Flight TG606, and they wanted to locate all other passengers. The man became sick while he was staying in the Thai capital from March 25 to Saturday, but health officials in Hong Kong said they did not immediately know his nationality or where he contracted his illness. Global health officials say they have been worried by the spread of the illness by air travelers _ which is apparently how it moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada and Vietnam, all of which have suffered deaths. Hong Kong officials said earlier Tuesday that four recreational activity camps could be turned into quarantine centers for 1,000 people, but they were only sending the people from Amoy Gardens to two of them.
