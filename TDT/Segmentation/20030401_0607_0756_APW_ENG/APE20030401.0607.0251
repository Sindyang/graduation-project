A multibillion euro (dollar) aid-and-trade pact between the European Union and 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations came into effect Tuesday, aiming to fight poverty and promote democracy. EU officials said 16 billion euros (US$17.4 billion) in aid could now start to be disbursed to the ACP countries, many of whom are among the world's poorest nations. They said the financial aid would be disbursed under separate development programs for each ACP country. The new 25-year Cotonou agreement, named after the Benin capital where it was signed, was ratified by all 15 EU governments and all ACP members after a two-year delay due to concerns the package could violate world trade rules. The deal promises aid to ACP nations only if they show improvements in human rights and a reduction in corruption. The Cotonou agreement also encourages the ACP members to form regional trade blocs among themselves and with the EU to promote economic growth. Both sides have embarked on new talks which will set the tone of trade relations once the EU abandons a quota system which violated world trade rules. Favored quotas on bananas will be phased out between 2002 and 2006, and sugar and rice quotas will be phased out from 2006 to 2009. Koos Richelle, head of the EU head office's development policy department said Zimbabwe, Haiti, Ivory Coast and Liberia had already been called on the mat for alleged human rights violations before the agreement took effect. Zimbabwe has already been slapped with a slew of diplomatic sanctions by EU nations, including a travel ban for him and his cabinet. EU nations have also frozen all Mugabe's financial assets in Europe. Meanwhile, Cuba which is not a signatory to the new pact because of continuing alleged human rights violations, has lobbied to be included. EU Development Commission Poul Nielson said last month he would ask EU governments to include Cuba into the new agreement hoping it will turn the communist-run country toward democracy and improved human rights. Cuba insists it respects human rights better than most nations by ensuring broad social services for its people, including free education and health care. ^ (cb/rac &lt;
