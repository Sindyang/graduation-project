A 72-year-old man who fell ill after returning from the Far East is suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hospital said Tuesday, confirming the fourth case in Germany so far. The patient has largely recovered and does not appear to have infected others, according to the clinic near the western city of Dortmund where he is being treated. The man was one of several patients put into isolation wards in Germany to guard against a spread of the mystery illness that has infected some 1,600 people worldwide, mostly in Asia, killing more than 60. Tests at a laboratory in Hamburg confirmed that the man, who was not identified, was suffering from the virus after returning from a trip to Singapore and Vietnam, the hospital said. Three patients from Singapore being treated for SARS at a Frankfurt clinic since March 15 also are expected to make a full recovery, doctors said last week. The three, including a doctor who had treated SARS patients in Singapore, were taken off a New York-Singapore flight in Frankfurt. German authorities also are carrying out tests on a 62-year-old man suspected of having contracted the illness on a trip to China and Hong Kong. The patient is under quarantine at a Munich hospital. Tests have shown several other suspected cases in Germany to be false alarms. (swg-cb)
