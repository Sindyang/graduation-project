Poland's health minister quit Monday in a dispute with Prime Minister Leszek Miller, the latest blow for the shaky minority government that wants to lead the nation into the European Union. Marek Balicki said he resigned because he lacked faith that a top health care administrator, whom Miller appointed Monday against his wish, could lead the cash-strapped national system out of its crisis. Miller's Democratic Left Alliance of reformed communists has led a minority government since he dumped the farm-based Peasants Party last month. His Cabinet has splintered under political pressures ahead of a June referendum on EU membership. ``I don't understand the prime minister's motives,'' Balicki told a news conference. ``This decision is bad for the government, bad for the Democratic Left Alliance and bad for the repair process of the health care system.'' Balicki's departure after 10 weeks in the job added to the image of disarray in Miller's government, deeply unpopular amid an economic slump and unemployment at a post-communist high of nearly 19 percent. Reforming health care is another nagging problem _ one that has dogged all Polish governments since communism fell in 1989. Government attempts to cut subsidies and rein in health care costs have led to protests from poorly paid doctors and nurses, and patients often have to wait for weeks or months to see a specialist. And Hospital closures _ seen by officials as another way to save money _ have triggered protests by residents. Balicki said he objected to Miller's appointment of Aleksander Nauman, a holdover from the previous minister, to head a new national fund to administer the state health care system. A powerful official, the fund chief will administer about 30 billion zlotys (US$7.3 billion) yearly in medical payments nationwide. The new minister was expected to be Ewa Kralkowska, a deputy under the previous health minister. The outgoing minister gave few details of any policy disputes, but Kralkowska was considered more of a Miller loyalist than the more independent-minded Balicki, who used to belong to the center-right Freedom Union. ``People who are not deeply rooted in the Alliance like Balicki have a weak position,'' political analyst Pawel Spiewak said. ``Miller doesn't trust his ministers.'' The government says the new national fund that began operation Tuesday will be more efficient than 17 regional funds introduced by the previous Solidarity-led administration. Contract negotiations with hospitals and doctors will be easier under the new system, the government says. Balicki's predecessor Mariusz Lapinski was fired by Miller in January over his handling of the health care system's debts. In other recent trouble for Miller, two opposition parties are seeking a parliamentary confidence vote aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik for the recent botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals that left two police officers dead. Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki also was at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill. ^ (ms-ajs-tc-cb) &lt;
