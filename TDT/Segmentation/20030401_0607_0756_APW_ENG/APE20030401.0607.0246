The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he expects his agency's inspectors to return to Iraq after the war has ended. Mohamed ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a statement released to The Associated Press that the agency expected ``to go back with full authority after the cessation of hostilities.'' ``The IAEA mandate in Iraq is still valid and has not changed, and the IAEA is the sole body with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear disarmament,'' ElBaradei said. Inspections have underpinned international nonproliferation obligations for 30 years, he said. ``Only through impartial, international inspections can credibility be generated. Iraq is no exception to that requirement,'' he said. The agency's inspectors had made ``good progress'' since returning to Iraq in November after a four-year hiatus. The inspectors found no evidence Iraq held nuclear weapons, but agency officials have said more inspections were needed for a conclusive judgment. ``We stand ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume our work after the war and to provide the ongoing assurances sought by the Security Council, that Iraq has no nuclear weapons program,'' ElBaradei said.
