A square in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin has been named after an Iraqi suicide bomber who killed four U.S. troops over the weekend, camp officials said Tuesday. The naming of the square is part of weeklong anniversary commemorations of an 11-day battle between Israeli troops and about 150 gunmen in the camp in April 2002 _ one of the toughest in 30 months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting. Fifty-two Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting that left large patches of the Jenin camp in ruins. On Monday, a small square in the camp was named after Ali Joafar al-Noamani, a non-commissioned Iraqi officer who blew himself up at a U.S. checkpoint in southern Iraq on Saturday, killing for U.S. troops. The bombing symbolizes the close ties between Iraqis and Palestinians, said Akram Abu Esbaa, organizer of the commemorations. ````We are experiencing the same tragedy here in Palestine that they are in Baghdad,'' he said. As part of anniversary events, camp residents will march in support of Iraq on Thursday and plan prayers are planned in a demolished section of the camp on Friday in honor of the Iraqi dead. Residents also hope to collect 10,000 pints of blood, to be delivered to Iraq through the Red Crescent Society, camp officials said. By Tuesday, they had collected hundreds of pints ready for shipment. In Gaza City, about 700 Palestinians marched in support of Iraq, carrying Iraqi flags, posters of Saddam Hussein and banners reading ``No Blood for Oil.'' ^ hf-kl &lt;
