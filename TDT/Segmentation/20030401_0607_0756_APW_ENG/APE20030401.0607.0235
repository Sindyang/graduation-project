Police arrested 10 Sri Lankans on Tuesday after their alleged attempt to migrate to Italy failed because their boat broke down, a police officer said. The would-be migrants _ who were all men _ were forced to return to Sri Lanka when their vessel ran into technical problems, said G.K. Sumith, a police officer from the town of Beruwela _ 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of capital Colombo. He said the aspiring migrants were forced to return nine days after setting off from Beruwela, where they were arrested Tuesday. Sumith said the men will face charges of violating immigration laws. If found guilty, they could be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined 200,000 rupees (US$2,080). Every year, hundreds of Sri Lankans try to migrate illegally to the United States and Europe in search of jobs. The island nation suffered 19 years of civil war, which displaced hundreds of thousands and devastated the economy. The government and Tamil Tiger rebels are now engaged in peace talks to end the conflict. Last November, Italy deported 1,324 illegal migrants, including Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka's Interior Ministry last year appointed a special police team to curb people smuggling.
