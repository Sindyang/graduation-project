Turkey is still plagued with serious human rights violations, including killings and torture, despite government pledges to eradicate the abuses and some improvements in the country's record, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday. ``Security forces continued to commit unlawful killings including deaths due to excessive use of force and torture,'' the State Department said in its annual human rights report. ``Torture, beatings and other abuses by security forces remained widespread, although the number of reported cases declined.'' The report said the independent Human Rights Foundation estimated the number of credible applications by torture victims at its five national treatment centers at approximately 965, compared with 1,200 in 2001. The report did not say how many unlawful killing were suspected in 2002, but gave several examples of such cases. It said that in July 2002, government-armed village guards killed three people in the southeastern province of Mus, while in March, ``five bullet-riddled bodies were found in the southeastern province of Sirnak.'' Turkey has taken steps to improve its poor human rights record under pressure from the European Union, which it aspires to join. The new Islamic-rooted government has declared a ``zero'' tolerance campaign against torture. But the report said that still had to be applied. ``Although civilian and military authorities remained publicly committed to the rule of law and respect for human rights, members of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses,'' the 64-page report said. It quoted human rights observers and medical experts as saying that security officials often used methods that did not leave physical traces, including applying electric shocks to a metal chair where the detainee is seated rather than directly to the body. The report underlined the lack of immediate access to an attorney, long detention periods and poor prison conditions, as well as limitations to freedom of speech and press. The report also said human rights violations were more likely to happen in southeastern Turkey, where the Turkish military fought a 15-year war against autonomy-seeking Turkish Kurdish rebels. ``Human rights advocates believe that thousands of detainees were tortured during the year in the southeast, where the problem was particularly serious, but that only five to 20 percent reported torture because they feared retaliation or believed that complaints were futile,'' the report said. Trials of security force members have increased in recent years. On Tuesday, an Istanbul court sentenced a former police officer to 4 years and two months in prison for torturing and ``causing the death'' of a labor union leader who died in police custody, a lawyer representing his family, Ercan Kanar, said. Another police officer was freed and a third is still at large. Labor leader Suleyman Yeter died while in police custody in 1999. Kanar said he planned to appeal the sentence. ^ ea-sh-ht/lm-fd &lt;
