Pakistan's top cricket body Tuesday said it hopes the country's starless cricket squad will do well in this week's four-nation tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan will play its first Sharjah Cup match against Zimbabwe on April 3, still hurting from its failure to qualify for the World Cup semifinals, which led to a drastic shake-up of the team. The final at Sharjah will be played on April 10. The Pakistan Cricket Board sidelined several senior players. Former captain Waqar Younis, vice-captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi all will miss Sharjah and some were advised to ``rest for some time.'' The board has appointed former test captain Javed Miandad as the new coach, and named the experienced Rashid Latif, 34, as captain. The team also has a new manager, Haroon Rasheed, a former hard-hitting batsman. Former opener Aamir Sohail heads the cricket board's new selection committee. ``If we win in Sharjah, it will be a huge bonus,'' Samiul Hasan, a spokesman for the board, told the Associated Press. ``We have to be patient with this young team,'' he said. He said the team was building the skills of its younger players to give them international exposure to prepare for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Among the new players are fast bowler Umer Gul, who has been compared to Australia's Glen McGrath. All-rounder Rana Naved-ul Hasan and opener Muhammad Hafeez will also make their international cricket debut. Faisal Iqbal, Misbah-ul Haq, Danish Kaneria and Muhammad Zahid have previously played for Pakistan, but need more experience. Latif, the captain, was due to retire from international cricket after the World Cup debacle, but agreed to stay on until Pakistan settles on a new captain. South Africa was originally scheduled to play in Sharjah, but team members refused to travel to the desert venue because of the Iraq war. The organizers then made the event a four-team competition between Zimbabwe, Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pakistan team: Rashid Latif (captain), Taufeeq Umer, Muhammad Hafeez, Naved Latif, Yousuf Youhana (vice captain), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-haq, Faisal Iqbal, Shoaib Malik, Danish Kaneria, Umer Gul, Muhammad Zahid, Muhammad Sami, Rana Navedul Hasan, Abdul Razzaq, Rashid Latif.
