Tests on a reactor at the troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin near the border with Austria have caused an unexpected shutdown, an official said Tuesday. Plant spokesman Milan Nebesar said the reactor of the plant's second unit automatically shut down Monday during tests in which workers cut off steam supply into the turbine. ``We were testing the response of the control system,'' Nebesar said, adding the shutdown of the reactor was unexpected. ``A drop in the reactor's output under 40 percent of its capacity would have been enough'' during the tests, rather than shutting down completely, Nebesar said. He said the reactor would be restarted later in the day. The reactor was shut down already on March 6 after a minor leak was detected in a steam pipeline, just four days after workers started testing the reactor of the plant's second unit at full capacity. It was then restarted on Thursday last week. The 1,000-megawatt unit is scheduled for commercial use by the beginning of 2004. The plant, based on Russian design and upgraded with U.S. technology, has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear malfunctions since testing began in November 2000. Located just 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of the Austrian border, it has been a source of friction between the two countries. Critics in non-nuclear Austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down, but Czech authorities insist the plant is safe. The plant's other 1,000-megawatt unit, currently shut down for two months during planned maintenance, has already entered the last stage of tests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003.
