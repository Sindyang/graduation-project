Retail sales in Britain suffered the most widespread annual fall for more than a decade in March, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) published Tuesday. Of the 227 respondents, only 28 percent of firms said sales were up on March last year, while 41 percent said they were down, the business grouping said. The difference between the two gives a balance of minus 13 per cent, the first significant fall since January 1999 and the lowest balance since July 1992. The outlook remains downbeat with sales expected to remain unchanged in the year to April, the weakest expectations for eight years, the survey found. "Sales growth has stalled in almost every retail sector," said CBI chief economic adviser Ian McCafferty. "These results confirm our fears that consumer confidence has been affected by uncertainties surrounding the war in Iraq, the impending tax rises and worries about the housing market," he added. This month British consumers face increases in both national insurance, a direct payroll tax, and council tax, which is imposed by local authorities. The survey, conducted between March 4 and 19, covers more than 20,000 outlets of firms responsible for 40 percent of employment in retailing. dr/pw/hd Britain-economy-retail-confidence
