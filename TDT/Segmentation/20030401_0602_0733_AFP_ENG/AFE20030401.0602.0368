The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the reopening of a murder case against a top senator and presidential hopeful. Voting 10-4 with one abstention, it ordered a regional trial court to "proceed with dispatch on the case" against Panfilo Lacson, a tough-talking former national police chief who is tipped as a leading opposition candidate for next year's presidential race. Lacson, who was chief of an elite presidential anti-crime unit under former president Joseph Estrada, and several other police officers had been charged previously before a special anti-graft court for the May 1995 murder of 11 alleged members of a notorious robbery gang called Kuratong Baleleng. The Supreme Court subsequently transferred the case to the suburban Quezon city regional court north of Manila, which then dismissed the case in 1999 because several witnesses recanted their statements. A new investigation was launched by the justice deparment in 2001 after new witnesses came forward, and it asked the Supreme Court to have the case revived. Lacson in a statement said Tuesday's ruling was "most lamentable." He argued that the case should not be revived because a "two-year prescriptive period" in which court rulings could be appealed against has lapsed. "The decision of the high tribunal bodes ill for the rule of law in this country, considering that the same Supreme Court defined the rules of prescription," Lacson said. "I have already conferred with my lawyers and they will file a motion for reconsideration but as things stand now, there's a very slim chance that our motion will be granted." "The Supreme Court is the final arbiter when it come to matters of law," President Gloria Arroyo's spokesman Ignacio Bunye said, reacting to the ruling. "It is an independent body. Its decision carries the weight of the law and must be respected." Court officials said Lacson has 15 days to appeal the Tuesday ruling. Lacson had earlier announced plans to contest the presidency in May next year and is believed to be among the politicians short-listed to be the opposition's standard bearer. str/jvg/pp/rcw Philippines-crime-politics
