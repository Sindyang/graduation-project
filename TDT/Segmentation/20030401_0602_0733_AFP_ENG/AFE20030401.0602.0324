ANKARA, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell was due in Turkey late Tuesday on a fence-mending mission to underline Washington's commitment to the strategic partnership between the two countries, dented by a series of rows over Iraq. Relations between the United States and Turkey, the only Muslim member of NATO, have deteriorated since the Turkish parliament on March 1 narrowly rejected US plans to deploy 62,000 troops here to open a northern front in the war. "In Ankara, Secretary Powell will meet with Turkish leaders to strengthen our relationship," spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington, referring to Turkey as "key ally in a key place at a key time." Topics to be discussed included Iraq as well as the global war on terrorism and Cyprus, he said. Powell will "make sure that nobody gets the wrong impression we're angry with each other. He's not bringing money, he's not going to bang his fist on the table," an Ankara-based US diplomat said. The State Department's announcement of Powell's hastily arranged trip, which will see him also visit NATO headquarters in Brussels, took Ankara by surprise. The Turkish parliament's decision, which US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz slammed last week as a "big mistake", infuriated the White House. Powell however was not expected to raise the troops issue with Turkish leaders. US naval vessels that lay off Turkey for weeks waiting for permission to land heavy armour in Turkey have long since left the Mediterranean for the Gulf. Powell might simply ask Turkey, which granted US warplanes overflight rights on the second day of the war, to agree to broaden the agreement under which its airspace can be used to help with refueling. Several Turkish newspapers suggested Tuesday Powell might have new military demands up his sleeve. But Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul dismissed the suggestion, saying: "What we know right now is that Powell is visiting an ally country. There is nothing planned". Powell was expected to meet here Wednesday morning with Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and possibly with armed forces chief of staff, General Hilmi Ozkok. In Ankara, Powell will continue to hammer home Washington's opposition to Turkish troops entering northern Iraq, an area controlled by Kurdish forces allied to the United States. Ankara fears that Kurds in northern Iraq could declare an independent state, setting a dangerous example to its own large Kurdish population just across the border in southeastern Turkey, which has only just started to recover from a separatist rebellion which left more than 36,000 people in the 1990s. Diplomats said other issues, such as the future status of the divided island of Cyprus, Turkey's drive to join the European Union and the "war on terror" will also be on the agenda of Powell's visit. "The visit will focus more on bilateral issues than on Iraqi related contingencies," according to a Turkish diplomat. "It's a reaffirmation of our strategic relations ... (to) make sure recent developments do not lead to a weakening of our strategic relationship," the diplomat added. The two countries could also discuss aid for Turkey to help it overcome the economic difficulties of the war, after Ankara lost out on a promised six-billion-dollar (5.5 billion euro) aid package from Washington when parliament rebuffed US overtures on troop deployments. The White House has asked Congress to decide by mid-April on economic aid for countries which border Iraq. Erdogan said he was writing to all the members of the US Congress to explain the situation in his country where more than 90 percent of the population is opposed to the war. fc/jkb Iraq-war-US-Turkey
