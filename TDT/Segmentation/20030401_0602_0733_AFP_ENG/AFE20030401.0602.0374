The German government has asked the central bank, the Bundesbank, to calculate the value of Iraqi assets being held in Germany, the economics and labour ministry said Tuesday. A spokesman said the figures were expected to be ready "in coming days". Iraqi bank accounts in Germany have been closed under UN Security Council Resolution 661, which was passed in August 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. It requires all Iraqi funds to be frozen and forbids UN member countries from making money available to the regime. The ministry noted that under German law, Baghdad's assets here could not be seized, as is the case in the United States. The United States has confiscated more than 1.7 billion dollars (1.56 billion euros) in Iraqi assets held in US bank accounts and has called for the world to freeze any funds to use in rebuilding Iraq. Britain has also made similar moves. loc/km/hd Iraq-war-Germany-finance-banking-assets
