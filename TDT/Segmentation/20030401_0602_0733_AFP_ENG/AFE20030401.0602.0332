Two US pilots escaped with minor injuries when they ejected moments before their tanker aircraft slid off a carrier, the navy's Fifth Fleet said Tuesday. The pilots of the S-3B Viking airborne refuelling plane received minor injuries when it slid off the deck of the USS Constellation about 0210 GMT, said a news release received aboard the Kitty Hawk, another carrier engaged in bombing missions over Iraq. "Shortly after touching down on the deck, the S-3B malfunctioned while taxiing on the carrier's flight deck and slid to the port side of the deck," the release said. "The plane went over the side, hit flight deck safety netting and the two pilots onboard ejected into the water. The plane then went into the water," it said. A Seahawk helicopter, on standby in case of a flight accident, dropped a rescue swimmer into the water to retrieve the pilots. The frigate USS Thach, also nearby in case of an emergency, sent a boat to the scene. "Cause of the S-3B malfunction is under investigation," the release said. The S-3Bs, also performing a refuelling role aboard the Kitty Hawk, are to be phased out and their tanking job taken over by the new F/A-18 Super Hornet attack fighters, a pilot has said. it/kir Iraq-US-navy-eject
