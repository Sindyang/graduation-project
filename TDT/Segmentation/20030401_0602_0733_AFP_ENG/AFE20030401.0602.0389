India Tuesday warned of "great consequences" of the decision by the United States and its allies to wage war against Iraq without broad international backing. "This unilateralism can have great consequences in times to come... who will have to face what, time will tell," Defence Minister George Fernandes told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency in an interview. Fernandes also criticised talk of reconstructing post-war Iraq as "cynical". When asked what India would contribute to the rehabilitation effort, he said: "Personally I have a sick feeling. This smacks of cynicism of the worst type. "You go and bomb, blow up the whole place and in the process kill several hundred mostly civilians in the war, a war which does not have the sanction of the UN... and just about every facility and infrastructure is destroyed. "And then people start talking of reconstruction and rebuilding," he said. India had taken a decision to provide relief and rehabilitation to the people of Iraq in whatever way it could, he added. Fernandes' remarks came a day after Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha said the United States and Britain had made a mistake by attacking Iraq. er/an/th Iraq-war-India
