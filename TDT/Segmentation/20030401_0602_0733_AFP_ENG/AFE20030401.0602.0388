Bangladeshi port authorities Tuesday detained a cargo ship from Cyprus for hitting another vessel and causing damage to a port jetty, harbour officials said. The 16,000-ton ship, MV Commander Express, was asked not to leave Chittagong Port until an investigation into the incident was complete, harbour master Kamrul Hossain said. The ship, with 26 crew on board, had been sailing out of the port Tuesday when it hit the Bangladeshi state-own vessel Banglar Maya and then dashed against a nearby silo jetty causing serious damage to both, he added. The Cyprus flag carrier arrived in Chittagong from India last week carrying general cargo and was leaving for the Philippines. str/gt/an/rcw Bangladesh-Cyprus-ship
