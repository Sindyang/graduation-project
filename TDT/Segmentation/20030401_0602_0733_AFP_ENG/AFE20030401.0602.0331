Vietnam on Tuesday denied restricting the freedom of the leader of a dissident Buddhist church and said the elderly cleric was free to leave the capital. "These are false allegations," said Phan Thuy Thanh, foreign ministry spokeswoman, referring to accusations from the Paris-based International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB). IBIB said Saturday that Quang, 86, who recently underwent surgery to remove a tumour feared to be cancerous at a hospital in Hanoi, had been refused permission to leave the capital despite issuing a six-point statement asking for his immediate release. "The government does not prevent M. Quang to leave Hanoi," the spokeswoman said, adding that Quang was currently visiting the Vietnamese capital. Quang has been under effective house arrest since 1982 near the Quang Phuoc Pagoda in the remote central province of Quang Ngai. According to the IBIB, Vietnam is pressuring the patriarch of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) to move to the Nguyen Thieu Monastery in Binh Dinh Province, 160 kilometres (99.5 miles) from Quang Ngai. "This is part of a long-running government campaign to transfer Thich Huyen Quang to the remote province of Binh Dinh and maintain him under effective house arrest, whilst claiming that he has been released," the organization said. But Thanh said Quang was not under house arrest. "M. Huyen Quang can enjoy normal activities in Quang Phuoc pagoda," she said, denying the government had received a letter from the religious leader. The UBCV has been banned in Vietnam since 1981, when the sole Buddhist organisation allowed in the country, the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, was established. dla/th Vietnam-religion
