French consumers have turned deeply pessimistic and prefer to save rather than continue the spending which held up the economy last year, data showed on Tuesday, adding to government worries over weak growth. The consumer figures came amid a raft of new data on Tuesday, adding to concern over the government's ability to stick to the budget and planned tax cuts after being forced to almost halve its original 2003 growth forecast. Data released by official statistics office INSEE on Tuesday showed that French consumers were increasingly gloomy on all fronts, and were beginning to save rather than spend. The main household confidence indicator fell to minus-32 in March, from minus-26 in February, based on data collected from March 1 to March 19, just before the outbreak of the war in Iraq. Pessimism about the outlook for unemployment was at a "historic high-point", the statistics institute said that, but households were slightly more confident than previously about their ability to save. The news came as separate car industry figures appeared to confirm that the French consumer was indeed putting his foot on the brake. New car sales, seen as a leading indicator of economic activity, fell 5.6 percent in March, French car makers' association CCFA said on Tuesday. "After having fully supported growth, French households are giving in," said Marc Touati, an analyst with Natexis Banques Populaires. The INSEE data showing consumers' increasing inclination to save bore out remarks by Finance Minister Francis Mer last month, who voiced concern over signs that tax cuts implemented this year were ending up in savings accounts rather than shops. Data from the manufacturing sector on Tuesday added to the gloom, with the main purchasing managers' confidence index falling to 48.1 points in March from 51.5 points in February. The CDAF association of buyers and supply directors said its falling index reflected "the strongest deterioration of global order books in 14 months". INSEE also said on Tuesday that its index of wholesalers' confidence had fallen to a ten-year low point, with equipment sales -- traditionally seen as an early indicator of investment trends -- leading the swing to pessimism. Underlining the precariousness of France's current economic situation, Anne Beaudu of Credit Agricole said the last time INSEE's employment confidence sub-indicator was as low as its present level -- 84 -- was 10 years ago. "At that time, unemployment rose from 11.6 perent to 12.3 percent in eight months," she said. The government has shown increasing concern in the last week that prospects for growth this year, already reduced sharply at the beginning of March, are fading further. The most recent revision in mid-March saw the government's 2003 growth forecast reduced to 1.3 percent -- just over half the 2.5 percent prediction underpinning its 2003 budget. There is also alarm over the high level of both the public deficit and government debt run up in recent years, which seriously limit the government's room for manoeuvre -- for example by increasing spending to boost growth -- as it approaches a possible economic crisis. The European Union issued an early warning over the deficit in January, and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has admitted it is likely to exceed the euro-zone limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. Total debt, meanwhile is edging towards 60 percent of GDP, the maximum level tolerated under euro-zone rules. od/lmf/hd France-economy-confidence
