Italian police said Tuesday they had arrested four men in northern Italy suspected of links to an Islamic extremist organisation. A police spokesman declined to give details of the arrests, but newspapers reported that four men of Middle Eastern origin had been arrested on suspicion of links to the Iraq-based Ansar al-Islam. The men, arrested in overnight swoops in Milan and Parma, were reported to be under police surveillance for around a year and preparing to leave Italy when they were arrested. Investigators told the ANSA news agency those arrested are suspected of recruiting dozens of Iraqi and Kurdish volunteers to fight invading US and British forces in Iraq. They are being held on anti-terrorism charges introduced in Italy following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Up to eight others suspected of links to the Islamic group are being investigated as part of the ongoing operation, according to a judicial source. Meanwhile, Italian prosecutors have decided to drop terrorism charges against five Moroccans arrested near the northern city of Rovigo in January. Venice magistrate Felice Casson said the five would only be charged with the possession of an illegal explosive, and that the more serious charges would be dropped. Their lawyer, Sofia Tengo, was due to lodge a demand for their immediate release on Tuesday. clr-ljm/db/ns Iraq-war-Italy-arrests
