China's second largest mobile phone operator China Unicom said Tuesday its 2002 net profit rose 2.5 percent to 4.57 billion yuan (557 million US dollars) from the previous 12-month period. The result was in line with market expectations. Analysts polled by financial newswire AFX-Asia said they predicted a net profit of 4.5-4.7 billion yuan. Sales soared 38.05 percent to 40.58 billion yuan from 29.39 billion yuan earlier and operating profit rose to 7.78 billion yuan from 2.38 billion yuan. Unicom will pay a dividend of 0.10 yuan a share, the company said in a statement. The Hong Kong-listed firm provides cellular services in 21 Chinese provinces. China Unicom's bigger rival China Mobile (HK) Ltd. last month said it would pay a fifth of earnings to shareholders after reporting a net profit of 32.7 billion yuan. Shares in China Unicom closed unchanged at 4.28 Hong Kong dollars on Tuesday. bur/pl/dv HongKong-China-telecom-Unicom-results-company
