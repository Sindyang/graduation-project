A new trade accord between the European Union (EU) and 78 partner nations in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACP) took effect Tuesday, as parliamentarians from countries concerned met here. "The Cotonou Agreement has entered a new phase," Glenys Kinnock, the EU co-chair of the ACP-EU parliamentary grouping told the fifth session of the joint assembly, which began work in Congo's capital Brazzaville on Monday. The agreement is primarily an economic pact in the wake of previous pacts, but the accord now stresses respect for human rights, conflict prevention and resolution, and good and open management of public funds. The parliamentarians gathered in the central African country are set to assess progress in economic partnership talks since the Cotonou Agreement was first signed in June 2000. The multi-billion euro pact takes effect as of April 1 following ratification by all EU member states and most of the nations in the ACP grouping. Further negotiations began in September last year and have two aspects: overall talks between the EU and the ACP as a whole, and more specific discussions between European countries and nations in different regions. "These negotiations are extremely difficult," said a document released to the media by the ACP secretariat. "There are deep divisions between the ACP and the EU on matters of substance such as finalising the first phase of negotiations which should involve the whole of the ACP," it added. "For us, it's important that this first phase gathers in the whole of the ACP and that the EU makes firm commitments to follow up on negotiations with each ACP region," ACP spokesman Hegel Goutier said. "The European Union reckons that at this stage, it's simply a matter of clarifications," he said. Differences have also arisen on means of strengthening the capacity of ACP member nations to be competitive for "a gradual penetration of the international market," Goutier told AFP. "Since there are plans to scrap the non-reciprocal trade preferences we benefit from, the ACP countries need to be compensated regarding their export products." Such preferences allowed the free entry on to European markets without customs duties of ACP products such as sugar and bananas, but the Cotonou accord puts an end to them and authorises third-party exports to the EU. ACP countries are also seeking a reform of the rules set down by the World Trade Organisation," Goutier said. "For us, WTO rules are not fair and transparent. They need to be reformed. Our EU partners consider that these rules are flexible. On all these issues are EU partners are not being flexible." Congo's President Denis Sassou Nguesso urged negotiators to "conclude positively, in the interests of each party," saying it was a matter of "strengthening access to markets by ACP products, so that the ACP and the EU have an impact on WTO regulations." The Cotonou Agreement is valid for 20 years and open to revision every five years. It is the successor to the Lome Conventions that previously regulated EU-ACP cooperation. The accord provides for a first budgetary envelope of 20 billion euros (21.7 billion dollars) covering the first five years of trade. jg-bbos/nb Congo-ACP-EU-trade
