Malaysia's trade surplus dived 22.2 percent in February to 4.9 billion ringgit (1.3 billion dollars), the government said Tuesday attributing it to seasonal factors. The result was down from 6.3 billion ringgit in the previous month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Exports fell 14.8 percent in February to 25.9 billion ringgit, while imports declined 13.1 percent to 21.0 billion ringgit. The MITI said the value of trade is traditionally lower in February due to fewer working days in that month. In February 2002, the trade surplus was 3.61 billion ringgit, with exports of 24.03 billion and imports of 20.42 billion. Electrical and electronic product exports totaled 13.1 billion ringgit or 50.8 percent of the total in February, 2003. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remained Malaysia's major export market, accounting for 26.6 percent of total exports, followed by the United States, the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong and China. ASEAN, Japan, US, China, Korea, Germany and Taiwan were the largest source of imports. Imports of electrical and electronic goods totalled 10 billion ringgit representing 47.9 percent of total imports. Imports of intermediate goods accounted for 72.8 percent, capital goods 14 percent and consumption goods six percent. For the first two months of 2003, Malaysia recorded a trade surplus of 11.2 billion ringgit, with exports of 56.3 billion ringgit and imports of 45.1 billion ringgit. During the period, exports were led by electrical products, accounting for 50.4 percent of total exports, followed by palm oil and chemical products. Electrical and electronics goods also accounted for 47.4 percent of total imports, followed by machinery and chemicals products.
