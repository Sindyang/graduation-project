Indian shares closed 1.06 percent higher Tuesday on active buying in select index heavy stocks despite ongoing worries over a prolonged war in Iraq, dealers said. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index rose 32.23 points to close at 3,080.95. Dealers said trading was volatile with select technology stocks like Satyam Computer facing the brunt of selling, although it was offset by buying in index heavy blue chips. They said Infosys was volatile, but the stock closed firm, in turn helping the index to end in positive territory. Infosys closed up 40.05 rupees at 4,080.35, Satyam was down 3.35 at 173.60, HCL Technologies was up 30 at 155.25, while media stock Zee was up 3.05 at 65.55.

"Most of the funds as well as traders and retail investors have bought today (Tuesday). It was a technical rebound after Monday's sharp losses," said a dealer with a domestic brokerage. Dealers said despite the gains seen Tuesday, the market continued to be subdued by the Iraq conflict and its duration. "The market is moving on a daily basis depending on what happens in Iraq. Any development which indicates that the war will be prolonged, pressures the market," said another dealer with a foreign brokerage. He said the market firmed Tuesday on reports that coalition forces had made inroads in Iraq. "But the other worry is the possibility of the conflict expanding to other countries such as Syria," he said. jds/an/dv Stocks-India
