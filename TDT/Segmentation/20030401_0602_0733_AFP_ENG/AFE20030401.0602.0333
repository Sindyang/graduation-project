French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on Tuesday urged the public to refrain from displays of anti-Americanism linked to the war in Iraq. Raffarin told a meeting of parliamentarians that it is "essential to be on one's guard against all displays of anti-Americanism, which are unacceptable," government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope said. Recent polls show that almost 90 percent of French oppose the US-British invasion of Iraq and only just over a half want the allies to win. bur/hs/jkb Iraq-war-France-US-Raffarin
