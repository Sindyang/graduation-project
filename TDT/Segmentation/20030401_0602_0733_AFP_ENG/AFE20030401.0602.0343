Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will meet US Secretary of State Colin Powell in Brussels on Thursday for talks likely to focus on the war in Iraq, the foreign ministry said Tuesday. Powell is due to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels and to consult with members of the European Union in a bid to mend the transatlantic rift sparked by the war. It will mark the first meeting between top Russian and US officials since the start of the Iraqi campaign, which Russia had fought furiously to avert. zak/me/yad Iraq-war-Russia-US
