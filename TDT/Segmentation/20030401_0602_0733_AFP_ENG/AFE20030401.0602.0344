The Indian government, facing swelling market protests, backed off Tuesday from imposing a controversial tax which businesses argue will harm both trade and consumers. The national and state governments deferred plans to impose value added tax (VAT) on April 1, as many markets remained shut for the second day Tuesday as shop keepers protested the move, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said. Asim Dasgupta, Finance Minister of West Bengal state, said his counterparts from other Indian provinces would now meet on Tuesday next week to "review the situation and decide on the new date" for the implementation of VAT, PTI said. Traders say VAT is imposed on business at all levels of manufacture and production and so will inflate costs and harm both sellers and buyers. Retail and wholesale markets remained closed in several states, PTI said, after a call from the Confederation of All India Traders and another business protest forum. They exempted emergency services including health and transport sectors from the two-day nationwide shutdown. In the southern state of Kerala private buses stayed off roads and petrol stations and a section of the local hotel industry Tuesday joined the snowballing anti-VAT protests, PTI said. Even the bullion market and the bourse-influencing oilseeds segment joined the protest in the southern Tamil Nadu state, PTI said. The state of Karnataka has already washed its hands of VAT and said it will not implement the levy because of the growing anger. Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, reported medical shortages as pharmacists joined the strike Tuesday while in Bombay, India's commercial hub, the strike was near total, reports said. A majority of Bombay's wholesale markets including garments, tea, grains, oils remained shut and traders in the adjacent towns such as Nasik, Pune and Ahmednagar stayed away from business. "Prices of most of the essential commodities including tea and foodgrains, will rise if VAT is implemented as according to this system... which ultimately will be recovered from the consumer," PTI quoted a trader as saying in Bombay. pc/an/dv India-tax-protest
