England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson on Tuesday shrugged off reports that a Turkish spy had smuggled a video camera into the squad's training camp ahead of Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier. The reports were splashed across most English newspapers on Tuesday -- although accounts varied as to whether the alleged spy had been disguised as a golfer or a charity worker who was part of a party which met the England squad. Either way, Eriksson was not perturbed by the prospect of his Turkish counterpart, Senol Gunes, getting the inside track on his tactical preparations. "It does not matter at all," the Swede smiled. "I don't think they they could have learned that much by filming us yesterday as neither David Beckham or Kieron Dyer took part in the session." Even if England had been at full strength, Eriksson suggested Turkey would not have been surprised by anything they saw on the video tape. "When you meet a team at this level you always know how they will play," he said. "They'll know how we'll play and we'll know how they will play." am/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Spy
