Six Germans have gone missing in Algeria's Sahara desert, diplomats said Tuesday, bringing to 17 the number of tourists reported to have disappeared without trace in the north African country since late February. The six Germans, four men and two women, were touring the southern Algerian desert in three, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Their relatives have said they are "very worried" about the group after they had no word from the six tourists since a phone call on March 17, the diplomats said. The last time the group contacted their families was from the southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset, 1,900 kilometers (1,140 miles) south of Algiers, the diplomats said. Algerian officials have not confirmed the group's disappearance. On February 21, 11 European tourists -- six Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- went missing in southeastern Algeria, near the border with Niger and Libya. Those tourists were travelling in three distinct groups: the Germans in two groups -- one with four motorbikes and the second using two bikes and including the Dutch national -- and the Swiss in a separate group travelling in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The two groups travelling on motorcycles were last seen in Djanet, some 1,500 kilometres (930 miles), southeast of Algiers, and were travelling north to Ouargla, via Illizi about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Djanet. The four Swiss were travelling in the opposite direction, heading south from Ouargla to Illizi, close to the border with Libya. The official Algerian news agency, APS, only confirmed the disappearance of the three groups on March 17. Despite the use of helicopters with heat-seeking equipment to search the vast, remote desert, where it was feared the tourists could have been buried with their vehicles in a sandstorm, no trace has been found of the three groups of tourists. "Eleven people with vehicles and all their stuff, that leaves traces. They can't just vanish into thin air," said a diplomat of the first disappearances. Bands of smugglers are known to roam Algeria's southern Sahara, where they traffic in contraband across the porous borders with Niger and Libya. Many of the smugglers, as well as arms and drugs traffickers who operate in the area, have ties to a group of Islamic extremists in the area, led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar. That group's threats a few years ago to attack competitors in the Paris-Dakar rally forced the event's organisers to change the race's itinerary. Newspapers in Algeria recently reported that Belmokhtar's group had joined forces with the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), one of two armed Muslim fundamentalist groups which have waged an insurgency in Algeria since 1992, in which around 150,000 people have died. The GSPC and the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) rejected an amnesty offered in 1999 by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to all Muslim fighters who had not been directly involved in killings. The GSPC, which has ties to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, operates mostly in Algeria's northeastern Kabylie province and generally restricts its attacks to members of the security forces. bb/kdz/nb Algeria-tourism-missing
