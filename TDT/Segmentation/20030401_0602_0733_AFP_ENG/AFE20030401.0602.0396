Indian aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) said Tuesday it will invest nine billion rupees (187.5 million dollars) in the next three years to upgrade and modernise. "Unless we upgrade and modernise we will be totally out of business," HAL chairman N.R. Mohanty told reporters. "About 150 million dollars will be the capital investment needed to make the Sukhoi 30 Mk fighter jets and one billion rupees each will be earmarked for making the Light Combat Aircraft and Intermediate Trainer Jets," Mohanty said. India plans to locally build 140 Sukhoi 30 Mk which will be handed over to the air force between 2004 and 2017. HAL has paid a licence fee of 286 million dollars to Russia to be able to make the aircraft. India has been working for nearly two decades to build the Light Combat Aircraft, a single-seat aircraft considered an ideal frontline replacement for the Russian-made MiGs which dominate the Indian air force. It is expected to be in commercial production within two years. The Indian air force has placed an order for 12 of the new Intermediate Jet Trainers, which made its maiden public flight on March 21, and HAL plans to make about 200 after the first delivery scheduled for 2005. "All the funds will be met through internal accruals," Mohanty said. He said the state-owned firm clocked a 20 percent increase in net profit to 4.5 billion rupees during the financial year ended March 2003 compared with the last fiscal year. Revenues of the company soared eight percent to 30 billion rupees while exports shot up 53 percent to one billion rupees. "Today our thrust is to give finished products to the export market rather than making spares and components," Mohanty said. He said HAL was planning to make two hangars in Bangalore to bring all manufacturing and maintenance under one roof. "It will act as a centre of excellence and will help HAL to get more export orders," he said. jay/an/dv India-air-military
