The general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, Nong Duc Manh, will pay an official visit to China soon, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said Tuesday. Manh will go to Beijing "in the near future", it said without giving further details. The visit comes at the invitation of China Communist Party general secretary and state president, Hu Jintao, VNA added. Ideological soulmates but historical rivals, China and Vietnam fought a brief but bloody war along their common border in 1979 following a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. They subsequently clashed over territorial claims in the South China Sea in 1988 and 1992. But the relationships between the two countries have improved significantly recently, with Vietnam congratulating China's new leadership last year. dla/rcw Vietnam-China
