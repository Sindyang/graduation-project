A state prosecutor requested a life sentence Tuesday against an animal rights activist who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader Pim Fortuyn in a political murder that shook the Netherlands. "This was a murder of the freedom of speech," said prosecutor Koos Plooy in his closing argument on the third day of the trial. He said the murder, just days before a general election last year in which Fortuyn's party was tipped to score impressive gains, deserved "unique sentence". "Whoever hits the heart of the democratic process must be severely punished," he told the court. Fortuyn supporters in the public gallery cheered when Plooy announced he would seek life imprisonment. Van der Graaf, 33, confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. The assassination of the populist, anti-immigrant politician last May stunned the country, which had seen no other political murder in its recent history. gdh/sb/ns Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial-prosecutor
