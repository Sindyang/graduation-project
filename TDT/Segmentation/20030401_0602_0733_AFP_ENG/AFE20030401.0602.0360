German officials said Tuesday that they had smashed a people-smuggling racket based in the northern city of Hamburg after a series of dawn raids. By midday (1000 GMT) some 400 police and border officials had raided 24 homes in Hamburg and detained 34 people, although some were thought to have been released later. Among those detained were the 10 alleged ringleaders of the Algerian-led network. Police also seized 1,000 documents now being examined, and border police spokesman Ruediger Carstens predicted more searches and arrests. The interior ministry said earlier that the network was believed to have set up in Hamburg in October last year and to have links in Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as Algeria. Also raided in Tuesday's swoops was a workshop where documents were being forged or altered, a discovery which Carstens said was of "especially high value" to investigators. Around 800 forged, doctored or stolen documents were found in the workshop, including passports, credit cards and proof-of-tax certificates, as well as 20,000 euros (dollars) in cash. Investigators believe the documents were sold in the north African region for up to 2,000 euros apiece. They said it was not clear how many illegal immigrants the network may have smuggled into Germany or other EU states. km/loc/ns Germany-immigration
