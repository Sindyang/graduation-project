More than 14,000 Liberians have since late last week crossed the border into Guinea, fleeing fighting between government troops and rebels in their own country, according to UN relief workers. Guinea's interior ministry on Tuesday issued a statement saying the country was prepared to take in the refugees and authorize the extension of a camp to shelter them. Staff of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) late Monday said people had kept on coming throughout the day, but an unknown number had drowned trying to cross the river along the border. Housseni Thiam, president of the Conakry government's National Coordination Bureau for Refugees, said the interior ministry has ordered the army "to take in all Liberians and foreigners wishing to enter Guinean territory". Last week, more than 30,000 people were trapped inside Liberia along some 50 kilometres (30 miles) of border territory, between the towns of Ganta and Sanniquellie, UNHCR staff said. As fighting increased in this region between President Charles Taylor's troops and rebels of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), some of the refugees reportedly forced their way through border posts. Refugees told aid workers that they were on the move because of clashes in the Ganta area. Last week, the Liberian government said it had seized the country's second city, Gbarnga, east of Ganta, back from the rebels. This claim could not be confirmed independently. Inside Guinea, about 3,000 refugees have already been transported to the Yomou camp in the southeast, while 10,000 others remain spread out along the border, Thiam said. The LURD has for three years been trying to oust Taylor, a former rebel chief who came to power in a 1997 election after a seven-year civil war. Relief workers on Monday began a census of the refugees, with plans to get them to camps already established in southern Guinea, which has seen an influx of refugees from both Liberia and Sierra Leone in the past 12 years. While a civil war which devastated Sierra Leone for a decade from 1991 is over, Guinea is still home to about 100,000 refugees from several countries, primarily Liberia and Ivory Coast. The LURD on Saturday said in a statement that it was in control of 14 key towns including Gbarnga. But claiming control of the town, the information ministry in Monrovia warned civilians to be careful of one rebel vehicle mounted with "a heavy gun" apparently "headed for the town of Ganta". "The LURD forces in that jeep are armed and desperate and could begin killing innocent citizens at random," it said. bm-at/nb/kdz Guinea-Liberia-rebels-refugees
