There has been no increase in attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan since the start of the Iraq war, a US military spokesman said Tuesday, while announcing that two US bases had come under rocket attack in the country's south. Despite several recent incidents, Colonel Roger King said there had not been an "upswing" in attacks since the start of the US-led war in Iraq two weeks ago. "We looked at previous attacks on coalition forces during the last half of the months of November 2002, and January and compared them to the last two weeks of march following the start of operations in Iraq," he told reporters at Bagram Air Base 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of Kabul. "The number of recent attacks shows no increase outside of the norm." King said there were 17 attacks during the last two weeks of March compared with 34 attacks in the last 15 days of November and 22 in the second half of January. Overall, there were 27 attacks in March, compared with the worst month of November which saw 55 attacks. Meanwhile two US bases came under rocket attack near the main southern city of Kandahar on Monday, King said. "Two rockets were fired at Fire Base Gecko, northeast of Kandahar at about 3:00 pm (1030GMT) yesterday afternoon. Neither rocket struck the base. There were no casualties or damage to coalition assets," he said. A rocket was also fired at the Orgun-e base in eastern Paktika province at around 10:30 pm (1800 GMT) Monday, but did not cause any casualties or damage. In a separate incident on the same night, a US humvee vehicle hit an anti-tank mine on a road near Kandahar. "No one was injured, but the vehicle sustained extensive damage to the front end," King said, adding that a second mine was discovered and detonated. Coalition forces regularly come under attack from al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants. Following reports that posters and leaflets in the name of Mullah Omar had appeared in eastern Afghanistan, King said the fugitive Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar was probably still alive. "As I understand and the information we have gotten is Mullah Omar probably is alive," he said. "There are various reports as to where he may be at any time. The indications are he moves around quite a bit which is probably the safest thing for him to do if he wants to remain un-incarcerated." Mullah Omar and his former "guest" al-Qaeda terror mastermind Osama bin Laden remain at large despite a massive international manhunt and multimillion dollar prices on their heads. str-mtp/bc/rcw Afghanistan-US-attacks
