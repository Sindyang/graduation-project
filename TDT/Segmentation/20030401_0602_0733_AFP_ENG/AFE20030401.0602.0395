Coalition warplanes on Tuesday kept up heavy airstrikes on Iraqi army positions in and around the northern oil centre of Kirkuk, rebel Kurdish officials near the frontline said. The military officials said Kirkuk, now visible from advance positions of the pro-US Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), had sustained a heavy bombardment overnight Monday and during the day Tuesday. Air attacks on Kirkuk have intensified in the past week, forcing the Iraqi army to roll back its forces that once overlooked this PUK-held town. PUK forces have now advanced to within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of Kirkuk, but have been targetted by sporadic Iraqi army rocket fire. sas/mb Iraq-war-Kurds-Kirkuk
