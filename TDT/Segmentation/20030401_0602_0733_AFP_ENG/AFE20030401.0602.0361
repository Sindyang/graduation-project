Hong Kong sets up quarantine camps as rumours prompt panic-buying by Huw Watkin = (PICTURES) = HONG KONG, April 1 (AFP) - Authorities moved to set up special quarantine camps in an effort to contain a deadly viral epidemic here Tuesday, as rumours the former British colony would be declared an "infected area" prompted panic-buying by an increasingly nervous population. As the death toll climbed to 16 and the number of reported infections of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) soared by 75 to 685 Tuesday, a Web site report saying Hong Kong would be declared an "infected area" prompted a run on supermarkets. The continuing SARS epidemic -- driven by an as-yet-unidentified virus which causes a pneumonia-like disease -- had significantly reduced the number of people on the streets of this usually crowded city, but Tuesday's rumour created scenes that one long-term resident described as "unprecedented". "I was shopping early in the afternoon and the place was jam-packed. We waited in a supermarket queue for what was easily an hour," he said. "I wouldn't say it was panic, but people were certainly very tense and buying large quantities of food and water. Everybody was wearing face masks and many people were clearly agitated." The Hong Kong government later dismissed the report -- which coincided with April Fool's Day and reportedly appeared on the Web site of the popular Chinese-language Ming Pao newspaper -- as bogus. "I would like to take this opportunity ... to inform the people of Hong Kong categorically that we have no plan and there is no need for us to declare Hong Kong as an infected area," said Director of Health Margaret Chan. " ... our airport and all our external transport with other parts of the world will continue as usual. Everything is running as scheduled and normally," she said. Ming Pao later denied responsibility for the report, saying it had taken the matter to police and that it reserved the right to take legal action against what it described as "a hacker". P.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's deputy director of health, meanwhile said that hundreds of people confined for 10 days Monday under emergency quarantine measures to a 33-storey residential complex on Hong Kong's Kowloon peninsula would now be transferred to two government-run holiday camps. "As cases of atypical pneumonia continue to rise ... we have arranged for the residents to be transferred temporarily to two holiday camps to reside there until the end of their isolation period," he said. Leung did not specify the exact number of people involved in the quarantine transfer, but a health department spokeswoman told AFP earlier Tuesday there were only some 240 residents in 108 units when the order was put in place. She said that authorities had little information on the whereabouts of tenants from another 156 units who have reportedly fled, prompting fears the quarantine move would have little effect in slowing the epidemic's spread. Health authorities told reporters Monday that investigations by Hong Kong University had discovered the virus could be detected in the faeces of patients. He said the authorities were studying if the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens residential complex was related to a waste-water mains at the estate which had recently burst. The public housing estate was sealed late Monday by around 50 police officers wearing white masks who set up barricades around the buildings. The measure was taken after 185 residents in the block came down with the flu-like symptoms of SARS, including 64 who were diagnosed on Monday. hw/th Health-pneumonia-HongKong
