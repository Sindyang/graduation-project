Six Indian Muslim clerics are ready to take food and medicines to Iraq to help civilians caught up in the war, their organisation said Tuesday. The six men are in the Jordanian capital Amman and got their visas Tuesday but are waiting for permission from the interior ministry to cross the border, said Sabir Yasin Nirban, secretary of the Raza Academy, a Muslim organisation based in the western city of Bombay. They are carrying nearly 600 kilograms of aid, mostly medicines donated by Bombay residents, with them, he told AFP over the phone from Bombay. "It's a small amount, but if it can help even one Iraqi child, our purpose would have been served," Nirban said. The men are also planning to act as human shields. Nirban said the Iraqi Ambassador in Amman met the group and was appreciative of their plan. pg/an/rcw Iraq-war-India-medicine
