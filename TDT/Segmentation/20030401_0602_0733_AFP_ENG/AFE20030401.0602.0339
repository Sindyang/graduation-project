Deutsche Post World Net AG subsidiary DHL said Friday it expects China to become its largest market in the Asia-Pacific within two to three years. John Mullen, the firm's chief operating officer for the region, said the company's business volume in China is currently growing at a rate of 45-50 percent year-on-year. Mullen said DHL plans to add 10-11 collection and distribution points in China this year and invest further in infrastructure and technologies in the region. DHL raised its interest in Air China in early March from 30 percent to 40 percent for an undisclosed sum, but Mullen said DHL had no immediate plans raise it further. The company on Tuesday launched a new corporate visual identity to reflect its three distinct business lines in the Asia-Pacific. DHL Express will be the express delivery arm, taking over the existing business of DHL Worldwide Express. DHL Danzas Air and Ocean represents the former business of Danzas Intercontiental. DHL Solutions will combine the contract logistics, warehousing and distribution operations of DHL and Danzas. bur/pl/dv HongKong-China-markets-DHL-company
