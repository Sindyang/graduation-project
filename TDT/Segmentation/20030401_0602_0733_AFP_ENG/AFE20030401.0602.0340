It is not just England's Euro 2004 ambitions that are on the line against Turkey here on Wednesday. Since last summer's World Cup campaign ended with the failure to overcome a ten-man Brazil in the quarter-finals, Sven-Goran Eriksson has seen what had been a love affair with the nation's press, fans and football hierarchy steadily turn sour. A string of, at best, flat performances, has resulted in relations deteriorating to the point where defeat at the Stadium of Light will inevitably prompt a fresh wave of speculation about one or both parties initiating divorce proceedings. But if the pressure is getting to him, Eriksson does a good job of hiding it. "Why should I worry about things that might never happen," he said at England's training camp on Tuesday. "It's a waste of energy. "Turkey are a very good team but I think we can win. We are working for that and I'm very positive. The pressure is what I've had at every football game for the last 22 years." England's displays in group seven have undeniably been lacklustre: a fortunate win in Slovakia followed by a home draw with Macedonia and an unconvincing 2-0 win over the part-timers of Liechtenstein. But Eriksson dismissed suggestions that his dispassionate style was transmitting itself to the players. "If you want someone shouting, you will have to change (coaches) because I'll never do that. It has never been my style and at my age it is not easy to change your character." For all the criticism he has had to endure, Eriksson has proved capable of extracting good performances from his players in the matches that have really mattered -- the 5-1 World Cup qualifying win over Germany and the win over Argentina in Japan being the two most obvious examples. Overcoming the World Cup semi-finalists and their quartet of skilled midfielders in particular represents a challenge of similar magnitude for Eriksson's side. Defeat will almost certainly condemn England to second place in the group and the lottery of a play-off to get to next year's finals. "This is another of those big games against the team that are the main danger to us winning the group," Eriksson said. "If you get second you can end up playing a very big football country so this is a big game for us and the players know that." Turkey's coach Senol Gunes is not reading too much into England's performance in Liechtenstein or their recent form in general. "They were playing the weakest link in the group and played at a very low tempo in order to concentrate on their game with Turkey," he said. "I'm sure they will play a different game against us on Wednesday." With three wins out of three, Turkey know that avoiding defeat will be a good result - although they will also be keen to wipe an unfortunate record of never having scored against England from the history books. "There are two strong sides in this group so this game could be considered as a final and if we can't win, a draw will be good for us," Gunes admitted. Turkey will be able to call on virtually all the players who clinched third place in last summer's World Cup while England will be bolstered by the return of Sol Campbell, who missed the trip to Liechtenstein with an Achilles injury. His return to the centre of defence will probably be at the expense of Gareth Southgate. Eriksson has had to contend with a public clamour for Everton's Wayne Rooney to be given the chance to start after impressing in the quarter of an hour he was afforded on Saturday. The England coach believes the 17-year-old did enough to show he is ready to grace the international stage on a regular basis. But he looks set to stick with Emile Heskey as the starting partner for his Liverpool team-mate Michael Owen. am/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR
