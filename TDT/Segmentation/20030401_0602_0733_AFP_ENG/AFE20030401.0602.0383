Several countries reported their first suspected cases of a deadly respiratory virus at the centre of a global health crisis Tuesday as Hong Kong announced plans to send victims of the disease to quarantine camps. Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Sweden said they were all treating patients suspected to be suffering from atypical pneumonia, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The virus claimed another death on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong man succumbing to the disease. SARS has now killed 34 people in China, 16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. In Hong Kong, deputy director of health P.Y. Leung said hundreds of people confined for 10 days Monday under emergency quarantine measures to a 33-storey residential complex on Hong Kong's Kowloon peninsula would now be transferred to two government-run holiday camps. "As cases of atypical pneumonia continue to rise ... we have arranged for the residents to be transferred temporarily to two holiday camps to reside there until the end of their isolation period," he said. Hong Kong and Singapore have also closed all primary and secondary schools in a bid to stem the outbreak. Singapore has put more than 800 households under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days and placed 600,000 school children on vacation until April 6. Thailand and India meanwhile joined a list of countries who have stepped up measures to combat the spread of the diseases, confirming plans to screen passengers arriving from infected areas. Thai health authorities took the step of declaring the virus as a serious communicable disease, an emergency move authorising the quarantine of suspected carriers for 14 days. In Australia, health officials said a man recently returned from Singapore had become the country's first likely SARS case but had made a full recovery after being admitted to a Sydney hospital. "We still cannot be sure this person had SARS, but in the absence of other diagnosis, we thought it would be prudent to alert the WHO (World Health Organization) to this unusual case," said chief medical officer Richard Smallwood. In Malaysia, health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif was quoted as saying that eight people with suspected symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been admitted to hospital for tests. A 37-year-old woman was in hospital in southern Johor state neighbouring Singapore while the other seven cases were reported in and around the capital Kuala Lumpur, he said. Indonesia also reported its first suspected cases, with two women feared to have been infected by the disease, Health Minister Achmad Suyudi said. On the medical front, livestock in southern China were cited Tuesday as a possible cause of the virus as frustration grew with Beijing for its handling of the crisis. The outbreak began in southern China in November, spread to Hong Kong in February and from there to three continents through airline passengers. The Wall Street Journal meanwhile called for the world to sever all travel links to China for the "grossly negligent" way it has handled the outbreak. But China responded by insisting it had acted correctly and now had the outbreak under control. "The Chinese government has all along adopted a very responsible attitude on this issue," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "We know the situation we're in is a safe one." The WHO has been more restrained in dealing with the Chinese authorities but a WHO expert currently in Beijing awaiting permission to travel to Guangdong province, the epicenter of the outbreak, betrayed some annoyance on Tuesday. "China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire. "During a global epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. A source close to the WHO said Tuesday that the Geneva-based health body was "working on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern China." Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying this is the cause but it is certainly something we are looking into in the general scheme of things." Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based WHO expert on communicable disease, said viruses of many emerging diseases were known to have come from animals by "crossing species barriers." bur/cl/rcw/th Health-pneumonia
