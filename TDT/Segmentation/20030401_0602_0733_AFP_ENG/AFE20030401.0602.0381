Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon has told manager Alex Ferguson he will have to sell some of his highly-paid stars if he wants to make any big buys this summer. Kenyon, who announced reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the six months to the end of January, said United were unlikely to match the 30 million pound (47 million dollar) fee they paid Leeds United for England defender Rio Ferdinand last July. Ferguson has spent almost 80 million pounds (126 million dollars) on Ferdinand, Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy over the past 18 months. But Kenyon said Tuesday any more mammoth buys were out of the question. "Certainly from Manchester United's perspective we believe these kind of sums to buy players are a thing of the past," he said. "It is fair to say that if Sir Alex wants to buy someone, he will have to sell someone else," said Kenyon. "The reality is that you can only field 11 players at one time and we currently have 24 in our squad, which, when it is supplemented with some of our younger players, we feel is the right number to get through 70-plus games a year. "What we have consistently said is that we will not bring in players just to sit on the bench." Ferguson recently complained that United were lagging behind the likes of European rivals Real Madrid and Milan in terms of squad numbers, but he was unable to bring in any reinforcements during the January transfer window. And last month Ferguson hinted he was prepared to off-load players like Ryan Giggs to help finance another splurge in the transfer market. Kenyon said he did not regret the Ferdinand transfer. "Hindsight is a wonderful thing but we are now seeing transfer prices come down. Buying Rio was the right decision at the time and it remains so," he said. "He fitted into the right age profile and we look upon him as a long term investment. "We made the decision to buy him in light of our overall wage structure and transfer budget we set ourselves and we achieved those targets," he added. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-transfers
