All sides in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war agreed Tuesday, at the final session of talks aimed at ending the country's four-year conflict, to set up a transitional government to lead to the first democratic elections in 40 years. "You are making history," the chairman of the talks, Sir Ketumile Masire, told delegates as the parley opened at the luxury casino resort of Sun City, some 150 kilometres (90 miles) northwest of Pretoria. The approximately 360 delegates attending the final session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue adopted by acclamation agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year, providing for a two-year transition government culminating in the DRC's first democratic elections since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. They also adopted a constitution, which was agreed on March 6. Delegates from the DRC government, rebel movements and political opposition on Tuesday morning went into the final plenary session of the marathon peace process, which began 14 months ago, and within ten minutes had approved the new constitution and transition government. The approved documents constitute the final act of the DRC peace process, which will be officially signed here on Wednesday at the closing ceremony of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue -- the talks' official name -- in the presence of some 10 African state leaders. The signing will be televised to viewers in the DRC, where the four-year war has claimed some 2.5 million lives, either directly through fighting or indirectly through famine and illness, according to United Nations estimates. str/jhe/hn/kdz DRCongo-talks
