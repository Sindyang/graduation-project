India alerted all its international airports Tuesday to screen passengers for symptoms of a deadly respiratory virus which has killed more than 60 people across the globe, officials said. "An alert has been issued to all immigration authorities and airlines to spot passengers with symptoms of the disease and quarantine them," Sudhir Kumar, director of the airport in India's financial capital Bombay, told AFP. "All passengers arriving from the 15 identified countries are being monitored and anyone spotted with the symptoms will be segregated," he said. The steps were taken following a directive from the health ministry in New Delhi Kumar said. "Close monitoring of all the international airports, especially Bombay and New Delhi is being done," he added. The mystery illness -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- has infected more than 1,900 people across the world. SARS first erupted in southern China in November but has now spread to possibly more than 20 countries, mainly by airline passengers. On Monday, a meeting of health, aviation and transport ministry officials convened by Health Minister Sushma Swaraj decided air and sea travellers coming from affected countries would have to fill a special form to help officials identify whether they were infected or not. Anyone suspected to be infected will be reported to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, a health ministry statement said. jds-er/an/cl Health-pneumonia-India
