Turkish and Greek leaders will discuss the divided island of Cyprus on April 8 on the sidelines of a summit between Balkan countries, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. Turkey will not give up its efforts to end the long-running division of Cyprus just because its rival Cypriot Greek and Turkish communities failed last month to agree on a UN plan to reunite their Mediterranean island, Erdogan told parliamentarians from his ruling Justice and Development Party. "We want to make new openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan said. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway Turkish state in the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new steps" ahead of the planned meeting in Belgrad between Greek and Turkish prime and foreign ministers, Erdogan said. "I hope our efforts will make a positive contribution the Cyprus problem," Erdogan added. In Athens, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas confirmed that Turkey had proposed a meeting on the Cyprus question, but said it was not yet certain that it would take place. "Cyprus is an open issue for us. The meeting has not been finalised yet, but we can not rule out that it will take place," Protopapas told reporters, saying that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would not be in Belgrade until April 9. A diplomatic source told AFP that Greece "viewed the proposal favourably," but that the meeting was "not 100-percent sure." The Turkish press has recently reported that Ankara was planning to look for a Cyprus solution outside the United Nations framework, but there has so far been no official confirmation of that. A last-ditch effort by the United Nations to reunify the island failed earlier this month when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash rejected the UN blueprint, to which the Greek Cypriots also had objections. The UN Security Council is expected to pass a resolution on Cyprus in the coming days, after UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reports on the plan's failure. The plan was largely regarded as the final chance to resolve the island's division before the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot side joins the European Union next year. The EU has said that if there is no reunification deal, it will admit only the Greek Cypriots. Cyprus has been divided since July 1974 when Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island in reponse to a Greek Cypriot coup that sought to unite the island with Greece. han/fc/yad Cyprus-Turkey-Greece
