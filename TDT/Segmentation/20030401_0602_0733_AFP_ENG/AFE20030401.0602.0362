David Beckham says England face their biggest match since the 2002 World Cup quarter-final defeat to Brazil when they tackle Turkey in Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier. Sven-Goran Eriksson's side go into the match two points adrift of World Cup semi-finalists Turkey who top group seven with three wins out of three. "We've had some big games since (the Brazil game) but none as big as this one," the England captain told SKY TV Tuesday. "It's the biggest game of the group, especially for us - they've been playing well. They're top of the group and they've got nothing to lose. "We said that at the start of the week - everyone was talking about the Turkey game being the big one and we're all up for it." The Manchester United star admitted England played badly in beating the Liechtenstein part-timers 2-0 last Saturday. "The Liechtenstein game could have been a dreadful banana skin. But we came out of there with three points. We were on a no-win thing," he said. England's displays in group seven have been a fortunate 2-0 win in Slovakia followed by a home draw with Macedonia and a 2-0 win over Liechtenstein. Turkey beat Slovakia 3-0, Macedonia 2-1 and Liechtenstein 5-0. bur/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Beckham
