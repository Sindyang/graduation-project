Textured insoles in sports shoes could prevent many ankle injuries, according to Australian research published Tuesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Physiotherapists at the Canberra Hospital designed knobbly rubber insoles to fit the boots of 17 players from the Australian Women's soccer team. The players were then tested for "movement discrimination" -- the ability to move the ankle appropriately for the required conditions -- under three conditions. They were first tested barefoot; then using their own football boot with a smooth conventional insole; and then using the same boot with the replacement, textured insole. Unwanted ankle movement was worst of all with the smooth insole. Next best was to be barefoot. But best of all was the knobbly insole. The doctors believe that conventional insoles can smother important feedback signals from the extremely sensitive soles of the feet. These signals are designed to relay information to the brain about pressure differences in areas beneath the feet. The signals then help the brain to ensure that the feet and ankle are in the right position relative to the rest of the body. If the positioning is wrong, the delicate bones of the ankle and feet can be wrenched. Air-filled and gel-filled insoles, designed to dampen shocks, may make the problem even worse, especially in fast-moving ball games such as basketball and soccer, the doctors believe. "The insole is one aspect of football boot and sport shoe design that could be modified to provide the sensory feedback needed for accurate foot positioning," they write. ri/ds Health-sport
