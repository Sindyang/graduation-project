Pakistan on Tuesday demanded evidence from the United States to back allegations that it exported nuclear technology to North Korea, following Washington's announcement of sanctions on North Korea and a Pakistani nuclear facility. "There is no evidence about what the US is saying," Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri told AFP, after the US imposed sanctions on the A.Q.Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), a uranium enrichment plant considered the hub of Pakistan's nuclear program. "We have already told them (US) that if they have any evidence...against KRL they should bring it forward." The sanctions -- a two-year ban on trade with US firms -- were imposed because of KRL's "contributions" to efforts by an unnamed foreign "country, person or entity of proliferation concern" to develop weapons of mass destruction, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. Sanctions have also been slapped on North Korea for exporting missile technology, Boucher said. US officials have not publicy linked the two countries, but KRL is at the center of months of allegations by unnamed US intelligence officials that Pakistan helped North Korea develop its controversial nuclear weapons program in exchange for missiles from Pyongyang. Pakistani officials have vehemently denied the charges, and on Tuesday repeated their insistence that Pakistan has never proliferated its nuclear know-how. "Pakistan has neither imported nor exported this sensitive technology. What we have indigeously developed is solely for our defence," Information Minister Sheikh Rashid told AFP. He accused the US of "cold-shouldering a friend." "We are strongly committed to the fight against terrorism," he said in reference to the 18-month US-led campaign to wipe out the Taliban and al-Qaeda, in which Pakistan has played a crucial role. The sanctions were interpreted by some politicians and analysts as indications that the US was planning to deal with Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction after dealing with Iraq and other "axis of evil" countries. "The US and UK have invaded Iraq because it possesses weapons of mass destruction and both North Korea and Pakistan have them too, which means the next war to destroy these weapons will be fought in these countries," Senator Farhatullah Babar of the opposition Pakistan People's Party said. "I fear Pakistan might be targeted because its (nuclear) command and control system is not responsible," Babar said in an upper house debate. Rashid and Kasuri said Pakistan would not be deterred by any international pressure to roll back its nuclear program. "While continue to play our role in the international camapign against terrorism, we cannot be oblivious to our national security requirement keeping in view the inimical designs of a hostile neighbour," Rashid told AFP. The New York Times reported last year that a Pakistani aircraft arrived in Pyongyang as recently as July to pick up North Korean missile parts -- the payoff in what it said was a "deadly barter," raising questions about US-Pakistan relations. US Secretary of State Colin Powell later said he was assured by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf that "there are no further contacts" between Islamabad and Pyongyang. But Powell and White House officials have left unanswered questions over alleged links in the past. bc-mmg-rj/rcw Pakistan-US-NKorea
