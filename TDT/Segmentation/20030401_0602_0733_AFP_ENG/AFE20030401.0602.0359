Thai drugs war estimated to have killed more than 2,000: police by Thanaporn Promyamyai ATTENTION - ADDS rights commission quote, attorney-general's complaint /// BANGKOK, April 1 (AFP) - The estimated death toll in Thailand's brutal drugs crackdown has risen to more than 2,000, police said Tuesday as the kingdom entered the third month of a self-declared war on methamphetamines. A total of 2,052 people have been murdered across the country since the drugs war began February 1, including 46 people who police have shot dead in self-defence, national Thai police spokesman Pongsapat Pongcharoen said in a statement. Six police officers were killed over the same period, while 15 were injured, he said. "The police chief is satisfied with the results over the past two months," Pongsapat said. While police are unable to say precisely how many of the killings were drugs-related, the national murder tally has been widely used as a proxy figure for the number of deaths resulting from the no-holds-barred drugs war. Authorities have repeatedly said that the remainder of the murders were carried out by drug gang members in a bid to protect themselves from prosecution. Drug-related arrests over the period now totalled 46,776, while police seized 12.51 million methamphetamine tablets and 641 million baht (14.94 million dollars) worth of property belonging to suspected traffickers, Pongsapat said. Separately, 182 arrests of murder suspects had been made, he said. "For the third month, police will focus on the arrests of big drugs traders and investigate further to see whether they can seize property believed to belong to those involved in the drugs business," he added. Thirapat Assawasangsit, secretary to the National Human Rights Commissioner who oversees drugs issues, told AFP the new toll showed that the situation in Thailand was "very scary". "In any particular country if there are over 2,000 murder cases in two months, then that is something horrible," he said. "And police so far haven't come up with anything solid -- they haven't arrested (many of) the culprits yet. It's a very scary situation." Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is spearheading the war on drugs, aimed at stamping out the rampant methamphetamine trade here, most of which flows in from neighbouring Myanmar. The crackdown has attracted criticism from a range of rights groups concerned about allegations of extra-judicial killings and questionable official blacklists of suspects. A report Tuesday cited the deputy attorney-general Praphan Naiyakowit complaining that police had not passed any case details on to a committee he heads which is charged with overseeing extra-judicial cases. The committee was set up by the government in response to the criticism it received in the early days of the blitz. "Until now I have not received any murder reports for February and March. The attorney-general has set up ten smaller committees (to investigate this) but they have not been able to investigate anything because they have to wait for details of the cases," he told the Thai-language Thai Post newspaper. The national police office was supposed to submit details of the cases by March 28, he reportedly said. Thailand is the world's largest per capita consumer of methamphetamines, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. tp-sb/hw/ds Thailand-drugs
