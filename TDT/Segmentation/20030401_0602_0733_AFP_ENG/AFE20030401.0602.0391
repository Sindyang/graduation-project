A director with Indonesia's central bank was jailed for three years here Tuesday after being found guilty of failing to properly monitor the liquidity of insolvent banks during the regional financial crisis. Hendro Budianto was guilty of "negligence in carrying out his job" as the director of banking supervision with Bank Indonesia and had caused 9.793 trillion rupiah (1.10 billion dollars) of losses to the state, said Judge Panusunan Harahap. Budianto had failed to freeze the accounts of 18 now-dissolved banks and had instead allowed these banks to continue their daily operations, Harahap told the Central Jakarta district court. Prosecutors had asked Budianto to be jailed for six years. He has one week to appeal. At the height of the Asian economic crisis in 1997-1998, BI had given 144.5 trillion rupiah (16.26 billion dollars) of emergency liquidity support to numerous private and state banks to stop the banking system from collapsing following massive runs on deposits. State audits have shown that more than 95 percent of the liquidity credits had been misused. Many of the loans were used for foreign exchange speculation, for lending to affiliated businesses and for repaying subordinate loans. Many other banks spent them on funding branch expansion, acquiring fixed assets and even for lending through the interbank market. str-vt/rcw Indonesia-graft
