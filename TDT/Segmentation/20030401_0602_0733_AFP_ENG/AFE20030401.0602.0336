Two women now being treated in Indonesian hospitals are suspected to have Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Health Minister Achmad Suyudi said Tuesday. The cases, if confirmed, would be the first within the country. Suyudi said one woman had been transferred from a hospital at Pluit in North Jakarta to another hospital which he has designated to treat SARS patients. "We suspect that she might be suffering from SARS but we have to wait for the incubation period," he said. The minister said the woman had been in contact with someone from Singapore but gave no details. Suyudi said hospital doctors at Batam island near Singapore were monitoring the condition of an Indonesian woman who had worked in the city-state as a domestic helper. "We are waiting for the 10-day incubation period. She is now in her second day of treatment," the health minister said. He said he would issue an order Thursday forcing people either suffering from SARS, or suspected to be infected, to undergo hospital treatment. Two Indonesians outside the country are known to have contracted the disease. A 17-year-old Indonesian student in Singapore has contracted SARS after visiting the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and Hong Kong with his brother and parents. And a female Indonesian worker is in hospital in Hong Kong. Suyudi was speaking after a meeting at the office of top welfare minister Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially deadly infection. Suyudi said the government was importing face masks from China and the United States. Indonesia has no confirmed cases so far despite its proximity to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases including four deaths. The immigration department said its staff, who were wearing masks, were watching arriving passengers at air and sea ports for any symptoms. Incoming passengers must fill in a health form. "Any suspicious cases will be set apart by quarantine officials and if they are ascertained to be carrying the disease, we will deport them to their country of departure as the law stipulates," said department spokesman Ade Endang Dahlan. The number of ferry passengers between Batam and nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 percent, the state Antara news agency said. Authorities and hoteliers in Batam distributed thousands of masks. The health ministry has opened special phone lines for inquiries and briefed hospitals across the country on the disease. bs/vt/sm/cl Health-pneumonia-Indonesia
