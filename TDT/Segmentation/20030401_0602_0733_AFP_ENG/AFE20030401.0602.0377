A state prosecutor requested a life sentence Tuesday against the man who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader Pim Fortuyn, describing the assassination as an attack on the democratic process. "This was a murder of freedom of speech," said prosecutor Koos Plooy in his closing argument on the third day of the trial. "This assassination is without precedent and must never happen again," Plooy said. The murder happened just days before a general election last year in which Fortuyn's party was to score impressive gains. "Whoever hits the heart of the democratic process must be severely punished," the prosecutor told the court. Fortuyn supporters in the public gallery cheered when Plooy announced he would seek life imprisonment. Fortuyn's brother Marten, also present in court gave the prosecutor the thumbs up sign. Van der Graaf, a 33-year-old animal rights supporter and vegetarian, confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. The assassination of the populist, anti-immigrant politician last May stunned the country, which had seen no other political murder in its recent history. In his confession Van der Graaf said that he shot Fortuyn because he was "a danger to the weaker groups in society"; namely Muslims, asylum seekers, immigrants and animals. Van der Graaf, has been charged with premeditated murder, threatening Fortuyn's driver with a weapon, illegal possession of arms and ammunition. The prosecution said Tuesday that it would drop a fourth charge of possession of explosive chemicals because Plooy felt he had not presented enough evidence to support the charge. A psychiatric report ordered by the court and presented on Monday concluded that the suspect had some mental problems but was fit to stand trial and could be held responsible for his actions. Fortuyn was shot five times at close range as he left a radio studio in the central town of Hilversum on May 6, 2002, just 10 days before the Dutch general elections. He had rattled the Dutch establishment with his open homosexuality and fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric. But he also won broad favour with many voters who felt there was finally someone who spoke frankly and addressed their concerns. In his closing argument the prosecutor cast Van der Graaf as a cold-blooded killer who liquidated Fortuyn because he did not approve of his political ideas. Plooy reminded the court that Van der Graaf had only expressed regret over the killing in so far as it affected his girlfriend and daughter. "With the rise of a new political figure in whom he sees another danger to society I estimate that the chances that (Van der Graaf) will re-offend are quite high," said the prosecutor. After Fortuyn was killed, his LPF party went on to score well in the election and to take part in a coalition government. However that administration collapsed in September last year, and Fortuyn's party crashed in the ensuing elections, held in January. But despite the LPF's fall from grace, Fortuyn's outspoken views and anti-immigrant stance, vigorously attacked before by mainstream politicians, are now openly debated in parliament. The hearings in Amsterdam's high security courtroom known as "the bunker" will continue Tuesday with the closing arguments of the defence. The judges are expected to deliver their verdict in two weeks. gdh-sb/ds Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial
