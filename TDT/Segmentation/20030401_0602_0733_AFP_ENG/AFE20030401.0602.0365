Governor Gul Agha of southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province has ordered all Taliban to leave the war-torn country's south within 10 days or face "severe punishment." "In the coming 10 days all Taliban who are here in Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul and Oruzgan (provinces) must leave, except those who get a guarantee from someone that he is not going to harm the government or security," he said late Monday. Agah was speaking on his return from Shah Wali Kot, north of Kandahar city, where pro-government troops backed by US forces have been fighting suspected Taliban. "I promise the people of Kandahar that none of the Taliban can create problems for stability in the future. "I have ordered my commanders not to allow any Talibs in the villages; if they are caught they are to be punished severely." He said all Taliban working in the government or army must leave their posts or face punishment. "I will fill the prisons with them," he said. The governor did not say where the former Taliban should go, nor whether other provinces would be willing to admit them. Agha described as "baseless" Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah Akhund's claims in a BBC interview to have killed two Afghan soldiers, and arrested 65 other Afghan and US troops. "This claim is baseless. He did kill one (person), but that was an innocent ICRC worker and he did not arrest 65 people," he said. Salvadoran-born International Committee of the Red Cross worker Ricardo Munuia was last Thursday killed by unknown attackers in neighbouring Oruzgan province. Agha launched his military operations following the murder. Kandahar commander Khan Mohammad, who returned from battle with the governor, questioned where the estimated hundreds of thousands of former Taliban lingering in the four southern provinces would go. "Due to his anger he made this speech," Mohammad said, before holding talks with the governor. Mohammad said 13 Taliban arrested during the operation around Shah Wali Kot included former Taliban trade and commerce minister Mullah Abdul Rajaq. The eight killed included Taliban commander Mullah Gul Mohammad. Among those believed to have escaped was Mullah Zahir, described by Mohammad as a close friend of the Taliban's spiritual leader Mullah Omar, who has so far eluded capture despite an international manhunt. Three more Taliban were arrested near where the Red Cross worker was killed and Kandahar police arrested another 27 over the past two days, he said. Kandahar was the heartland of the Taliban regime until the hardline Islamist militia was ousted by a US-led coalition after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Taliban and al-Qaeda remnants continue to launch attacks against US and government forces. str-mtp/bc/rcw Afghanistan-fighting
