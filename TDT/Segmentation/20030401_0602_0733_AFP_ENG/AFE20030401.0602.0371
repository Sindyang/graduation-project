Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will go ahead with an official visit to India next week despite a pneumonia outbreak here, the Singapore foreign ministry said Tuesday. The Hindustan Times of India earlier reported that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) problem in Singapore and other East Asian countries could result in a postponement of the visit starting April 7. "The prime minister has confirmed that he will be visiting India next week," a spokesman for the Singapore ministry of foreign affairs said in reply to media queries. "The Indian government has been alerted of the SARS problem in Singapore but would like the visit to proceed as scheduled," the spokesman added. The mystery illness first erupted in southern China in November but has now spread to 22 countries after being transported by air travellers, although it is largely concentrated in East Asian countries. In Singapore, four people have died out of more than 90 cases reported. SARS has now left at least 63 people dead and infected over 1,900 people worldwide, reaching as far as Europe and North America. It is transmitted by close human contact althrough there are fears it could be airborne as well. The Hindustan Times had reported that as a precautionary measure, the Singapore government had asked New Delhi to consider a postponement of Goh's visit. It quoted an unidentified Singaporean official as saying that Singapore did not want the Indian hosts to be afraid of contracting the disease from their visitors. India alerted all its international airports Tuesday to screen passengers for SARS and quarantine those showing symptoms, airport officials said in the financial capital Bombay. rc/bh/rcw Health-pneumonia-Singapore-India
