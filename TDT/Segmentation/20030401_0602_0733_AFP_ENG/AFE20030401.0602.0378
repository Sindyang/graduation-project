Asian stock markets were trapped in a tight range Tuesday due to on-going investor concerns about a deadly pneumonia virus and the Iraq war. Japanese share prices closed slightly higher on fresh demand associated with the new fiscal year, but with the upside capped by uncertainty over the duration of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 index ended the first day of the new Japanese financial year up 0.18 percent or 14.01 points at 7,986.72 and the Topix index of all first section issues closed up 0.96 points at 788.96. "Yesterday, the local stockmarket was pressured by selling related to the end-March fiscal year account closure. But such selling eased today, the first day of the new fiscal year," said Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Hinode Securities. But Karikomi said the market failed to extend its gains because fears the US-led war in Iraq would be prolonged were still overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets continue to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," he said. Dealers said the release of the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing a marginal deterioration in business confidence in the three months to March had little impact on the market as it was within expectations. "There was no surprise in the Tankan survey. Rather, investors were reacting to growing uncertainty over the war," said Hiroichi Nishi, senior market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities. HONG KONG: Share prices in Hong Kong closed 0.44 percent lower due to continued fears about the rapid spread of a killer virus. The key Hang Seng index lost 37.56 points to close at 8,596.89. Dealers said the downside narrowed at the market close after the government rejected rumours it will declare Hong Kong an infected area. "Market sentiment was very weak because of the fears over SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)... there were also rumours that the government may declare Hong Kong an infected area," said Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities. SYDNEY: The Australian sharemarket was largely unmoved by falls in global markets, with brokers saying strength in the banking sector offset ongoing concerns about the war in Iraq. The SP/ASX 200 index closed down 3.0 points or 0.10 percent at 2,882.2, while the All Ordinaries index was down 4.4 points at 2,844.2. Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri said the defensive nature of the Australian share market was helping steady sentiment, enabling the index to shrug off falls in New York and London. "In these uncertain times the money tends to be directed towards the more conservative area of the market," Spiteri said. SINGAPORE: Share prices in Singapore closed 1.16 percent higher after recent sharp falls as investors looked to amass bargain stocks, but worries of the protracted war in Iraq remained. The Straits Times Index gained 14.76 points to 1,282.58, off its intraday high of 1,292.24 as profit-taking set in, and All-Singapore Equities index rose 3.51 points to 344.37. "Overall, the market is looking good. Although volume has not been high, movements have been rather slow," a dealer at a local brokerage said. "It is probably a 'slow and steady' uptrend, rather than one of those strong spikes," the dealer said. SEOUL: South Korean share prices rose 0.53 percent as retail bargain-hunting offset early weakness triggered by losses on Wall Street amid concerns over the Iraq war. The composite index closed up 2.86 points at 538.56. "It was just a brief break on the steep downhill slope," Sejong Securities market analyst Yoo Ji-Sang said, referring to the rebound from the 3.71 percent plunge on Monday. Yoo noted that foreign investors continued to curtail down their holdings in the local bourse. burs/dv Stocks-Asia-daily
