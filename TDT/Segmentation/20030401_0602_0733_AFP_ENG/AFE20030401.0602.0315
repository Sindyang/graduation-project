Six Germans have gone missing in Algeria's Sahara desert, diplomats said Tuesday, bringing to 17 the number of tourists reported to have disappeared without a trace in the north African country since late February. The six Germans, four men and two women, were touring the southern Algerian desert in three four-wheel-drive vehicles. Their relatives have said they were "very worried" about the group after they had no word from the six tourists since a phone call on March 17, the diplomats said. The last phone call from the German tourists was made from the southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset, 1,900 kilometers (1,140 miles) south of Algiers, the diplomats said. On February 21, 11 European tourists -- six Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- went missing in southern Algeria. Those tourists were travelling in three distinct groups: the Germans in two groups, one with four motorbikes and the second using two bikes and including the Dutch national, and the Swiss in a separate group travelling in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The two groups travelling on motorcycles were last seen in Djanet, some 1,500 kilometres (930 miles), southeast of Algiers, and were travelling north to Ouargla, via Illizi about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Djanet. The four Swiss were travelling in the opposite direction, heading south from Ouargla to Illizi close to the Algerian-Libyan border. Despite the use of helicopters equipped with heat-seeking equipment to scour the vast, remote desert, where it was feared the tourists could have been buried with their vehicles in a sandstorm, no trace has been found of the three groups of tourists. "Eleven people with vehicles and all their stuff, that leaves traces. They can't just vanish into thin air," said a diplomat of the first disappearances. bb/kdz/nb Algeria-tourism-missing
