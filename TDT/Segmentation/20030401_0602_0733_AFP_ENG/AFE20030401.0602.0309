International football federation FIFA on Tuesday postponed the Vietnam-Iraq 2004 Olympic qualifier due to have been played Saturday in Damascus. The game was originally scheduled in Baghdad but Vietnam had proposed to organise it in Vietnam or in a neutral venue like Malaysia, Singapore or Thailand. It was later changed to Damascus by FIFA. The return leg had been set for April 19 in Vietnam. FIFA would consult the Asian Football Confederation about new dates for both matches. rw/ak Fbl-VIE-IRQ-FIFA-Oly-2004
