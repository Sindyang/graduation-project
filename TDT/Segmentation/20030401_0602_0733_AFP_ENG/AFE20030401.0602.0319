Following is a snapshot of medical knowledge about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the term given to the form of pneumonia that originated in Southeast Asia and has triggered a global health scare: (Sources: World Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control, France's Pasteur Institute) WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF SARS? The main symptoms are similar to flu: high fever (more than 38C, 100.4 F), headache, sore throat, dry cough, muscular stiffness and wheeziness. Some patients develop pneumonia, and a number of them swiftly require artificial respiration. The mortality rate is about four percent. Many of those who die have other health complications, such as heart disease or diabetes. WHAT CAUSES SARS? The likely suspect is a coronavirus, a member of the same family as the cold virus. But an unrelated virus, called a paramyxovirus, which is part of the same viral family as the agents that cause mumps and measles, has been found in some samples. Some experts speculate the two viruses may work together to make a patient more vulnerable to infection. Incubation is short, between two to seven days, but jet travel means that cases can rapidly spread around the world. HOW CONTAGIOUS IS SARS? One of the biggest unknowns. At first, it was thought that the infective agent was borne in large droplets and spread only by close contact with an infected person, who for instance sneezed or coughed. This was because the epidemic was at first limited to hospital staff and relatives of people who fell sick. But a cluster of cases in an apartment block in Hong Kong has bred worries that the virus could also be airborne or waterborne -- in other words that it could spread through a water or sewage system or, like the flu virus, be inhaled in a fine droplet that is hanging in the air. These fears are being investigated -- there is no evidence yet to support them. WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR SARS? There is no known cure yet for SARS. Antibiotics have not worked, and an anti-viral drug called Ribovirin has had disappointing results. WHAT PRECAUTIONS CAN BE TAKEN? At home or at work, simple hygiene measures are advised, such as washing one's hands. Coronaviruses are often spread when an infected person touches a surface, leaving a virus that can survive for two or three hours; it is picked up by another person, who then infects himself by touching his or her nose or mouth. Keeping windows open and wearing a facemask may help prevention transmission in a SARS "hotspot" location. Patients with SARS have to be kept in strict isolation, and health care workers and visitors should wear filter masks, goggles, aprons, head covers and gloves when in close contact with the patient. WHERE DID SARS COME FROM? The first case came to public light in Hanoi on February 26, involving a 48-year-old American businessman, who was taken sick following a trip to Shanghai and Hong Kong. He was flown back to Hong Kong for treatment but died. There is also evidence that the first identifiable case of SARS surfaced in the city of Foshan, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, on November 16. One theory is that the pathogen mutated in livestock before leaping the species barrier to humans. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO COMBAT THE SPREAD? An international effort to brake the epidemic is yielding good results, says the WHO. A joint initiative to pool the expertise in 11 top labs in 10 countries was launched on March 17 and has already identified the coronavirus as the likely cause. In developed countries, health monitoring systems to detect and isolate SARS victims seems to be working well. There are also international guidelines for vetting air travellers with the suspected disease, but the rising toll of infections, notably in Europe, suggests some are slipping through the screening process. ri/yad Health-pneumonia-medical
