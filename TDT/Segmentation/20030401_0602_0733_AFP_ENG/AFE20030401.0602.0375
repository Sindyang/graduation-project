Attack fighters from this US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf bombed a yacht belonging to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the southern port of Basra Monday, a navy spokeswoman said Tuesday. It was the second such attack reported in a week. Aircraft also bombed an Iraqi naval vessel, the Ibn Khaldoon, Lieutenant Junior Grade Nicole Kratzer told reporters. She said both vessels were in Basra but could provide no other details. Damage was still being assessed, she said. Iraq described the naval craft as a frigate, but according to Captain Michael Mahon, who is responsible for surface warfare within this carrier's battle group, Iraq had only one missile patrol boat and a handful of patrol craft at the start of the war. On Friday the captain of the British frigate HMS Chatham, Michael Cochrane, said warplanes of the US and British coalition sank Saddam's yacht Al Mansur in Basra the previous Tuesday. "There are reliable reports indicating that in a blow to Saddam's presidential pride, the huge presidential yacht is among the ships sunk," Cochrane told reporters. British officers said that attack also wiped out most of what remained of the Iraqi navy, two large patrol boats and a supply ship. Cochrane said one other Iraqi patrol boat was already sunk and six others captured. it/mb Iraq-war-Saddam-yacht
