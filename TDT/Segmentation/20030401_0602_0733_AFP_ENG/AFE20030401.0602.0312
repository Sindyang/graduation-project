Oil prices slipped on Tuesday after a strike in producer Nigeria was called off, though continuing disruption of the country's exports and worries about the war in Iraq contained losses. The price of reference Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery dropped 39 cents per barrel to 26.90 dollars in early trading here. New York's benchmark light sweet crude contract for May delivery advanced 88 cents to 31.04 dollars a barrel on Monday, but was showing a loss of 76 cents in out-of-hours electronic trading. GNI trader Kevin Blemkin attributed the fall to news that Nigeria's principal labour movement had suspended a strike over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on workers' demands. The three-day stoppage was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. More than 800,000 barrels of oil per day, 40 percent of Nigeria's production, has been slashed from exports because of violent civil unrest ahead of general elections on April 12. Analysts noted that even though the strike had been called off, exports from Nigeria are unlikely to recover yet. Commerzbank analyst David Thomas said the end to the strike "won't have any impact on production for those areas where Western oil companies withdrew their staff." "You still have Nigerian oil production below normal because of the situation there ahead of the election," he added. There was little sign of an end to the violence at the weekend, when political thugs attacked an opposition rally in Nigeria's troubled Niger Delta, driving activists into a river and hacking them with machetes, eye-witnesses said. Jitters over the situation in Iraq subsided slightly, though traders were still concerned by the prospect of the conflict dragging on for weeks or even months longer. "As the conflict continues for an extended period, the oil market is likely to be pretty steady... But you obviously get volatility within a day according to whatever news come from Iraq," said Thomas. "Some oil fields are under US and UK control, but that doesn't mean that they actually started to control production. I don't perceive that we will see any sizeable exports from these areas in the near term," he added. pf-dr/pw/hd Oil
