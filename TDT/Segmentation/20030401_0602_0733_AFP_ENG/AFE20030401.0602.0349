Zimbabwe's opposition, which gave President Robert Mugabe's government until Monday, to take urgent steps to resolve political and economic crises, has yet to decide how to act now that the ultimatum has passed unheeded, the party spokesman said Tuesday. Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Paul Temba Nyathi said that given that the government has ignored 15 demands it made, warning of mass action, party officials would meet to decide on when and how to respond. "We as a party will choose our time, place and mode to respond to that failure," Nyathi said. The MDC issued an ultimatum to Mugabe two weeks ago after it organised a widely followed anti-government strike, calling on the long-time leader to take concrete steps towards political and economic reforms in Zimbabwe by March 31 or face more protests. Nyathi said the pressure is on the government to respond to the demands in the ultimatum, hinging on political and economic reform. The MDC said at the weekend his party's supporters had the right to protest peacefully and warned the government to soon expect a "final push that will restore our sovereignty, liberty and freedom." Meantime, the MDC vice president Gibson Sibanda, who was arrested Monday for alleged trying to "subvert" a constitutionally elected government arising from his role in the two-day national strike last month, spent the night in jail. He was to appear before a magistrate court Tuesday. sn/stb/nb Zimbabwe-opposition
