BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, a diplomatic source in the Belgian capital told AFP. In Athens, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas, whose country holds the EU presidency, confirmed that Powell had asked to formally meet the EU's foreign policy chiefs, followed by an informal gathering with the foreign ministers of the Union's 15 member states and those of NATO. According to Protopapas, Powell asked to formally meet EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana, the EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. "We do not object to that meeting, it will most likely take place," Protopapas said. "It would have been better if it had taken place before the war began, but it's never too late." Powell is set to arrive in Turkey later on Tuesday for discussions on the US-led war on Iraq. He will then travel on to Brussels for talks on Thursday with NATO and EU officials. He will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to the Russian foreign ministry. The US State Department has said Powell hopes to discuss issues related to the invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the post-war future of the oil-rich country. He could raise in Brussels the possibility of involving countries other than the United States and Britain in stabilising Iraq and maintaining order after the end of the war. Washington's strategy in Iraq has deeply divided its European partners and put strains on transatlantic relations. But the 15 EU members agreed at a summit on March 20-21 that the United Nations should play a central role in Iraq during and after the war. European calls for a UN-supervised administration in Iraq are becoming more strident, amid concerns that Washington may cut non-US companies out of reconstruction contracts in Iraq. phv-pap/yad Iraq-war-US-EU-Powell
