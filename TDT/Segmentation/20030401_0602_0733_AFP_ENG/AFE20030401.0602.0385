Thailand will need to reassure skittish European investors it will safeguard rights of foreign businesses or risk failure as a regional investment hub, the European Union trade boss said Tuesday. EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, concluding a two-day visit here, said European investment had flattened in Thailand after restrictive measures by the government. "During 2002, foreign investment has continued to decrease, with European investment stagnating" because business once bound for Association of Southeast Asian Nations members now flows into China, Lamy said in a speech to Thai and European business communities. Approved EU investment in Thailand has plunged from a high of 2.89 billion euros in 1998 to 579 million euros in 2001, and just 348 million euros in 2002, according to the Thai Board of Investment. "If Thailand wants to achieve its goal of becoming a trade and investment hub within ASEAN, I would urge the Thai government to consider how to attract new FDI (foreign direct investment), and how to reassure its existing investors," he said. Government initiatives aimed at restricting foreign business activities "undoubtedly had a negative impact on the overall foreign investment climate," he added. Debate in Thailand has rumbled on over whether the government should repeal 11 laws adopted at the time of the 1997-1998 regional financial crisis that were pushed by the International Monetary Fund to encourage foreign investment here. Investors in the telecommunications sector were particularly worried, Lamy added. "EU companies investing in the telecommunications sector have expressed strong concerns regarding possible reductions to the currently permitted levels of FDI. Furthermore, the liberalisation of the telecom market in Thailand is not proceeding at the pace which it should." Lamy said he addressed the concerns in talks with Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire whose family controls Thailand's largest telecommunications firm. Today's investors, he said, were seeking broader choices in the region with the pending implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, under which most countries in the 10-member ASEAN grouping, including Thailand, must cut import tariffs to a maximum of five percent by 2003. Thailand would benefit from having a multilateral framework on investment, as proposed by the EU, which would highlight transparency and further induce FDI, he said. mlm/sb/dv Thailand-EU-investment
