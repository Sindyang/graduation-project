Lenders to the 2.9 billion-dollar power plant built by collapsed US giant Enron in the western Indian state of Maharashtra started a meeting Tuesday to work out a proposal to revive the project, officials said. The two-day meeting is due to discuss a plan to start the 2,184-megawatt power facility, Dabhol Power, which has been shut for more than 20 months after a payment dispute with its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The meeting is between the Indian and overseas lenders to the project such as Industrial Bank of India, ABN Amro, Citibank, ICICI and others. "Our top officials involved with the project are in Singapore for two days starting Tuesday to discuss as to how the project can be revived," a senior official with one of the key lenders said. "The plan is to revive the project as soon as possible. Initial discussions will also focus on raising the immediate requirement for working capital to start the project." The bankrupt US energy giant Enron holds a 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power, while Bechtel and General Electric Co. each hold 10 percent. MSEB holds the remaining 15 percent. Last year's bankruptcy of Enron compounded the problems for the project, with Indian financial institutions who have lent 60 billion rupees (1.25 billion dollars) to help build the plant, going to court to try recover their dues. Earlier this year US Ambassador to India Robert Blackwill urged Indian authorities to reopen the project that has the country's single largest foreign investment. He said a speedy solution would revive the inflow of stagnating US investment in India. India's leading industrial group, the Tata group, and British energy major BP, are jointly planning to revive the project and have signed a memorandum of understanding with each other to assess the business prospects. jds/bm/dv India-Singapore-electricity-Enron-company
