China Tuesday lashed out at Taiwan for blaming the mainland for hastening the spread of the global outbreak of a deadly atypical form of pneumonia. "The Chinese government is a responsible government. The Chinese government has also spent a lot of effort to control the spread of the disease," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "I believe some parties want to use the issue to make malicious attacks. I think that is irresponsible and unacceptable," Liu said. Liu, who was speaking at a regular briefing, was asked to comment on Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian's comment Friday alleging that China tried to cover up the extent of the epidemic within its borders -- hence hastening the spread of the illness, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). "SARS first broke out on the Chinese mainland, but they (Chinese authorities) covered up the information, leading to a global epidemic that has also affected Taiwan severely," Chen said. Asked by a Taiwanese reporter Tuesday to respond to "President Chen Shuibian's" statement, Liu jokingly tried to correct the reporter's reference to Chen as "president." China does not use that title for Chen, as it considers Taiwan a renegade province awaiting unification. Taiwan has banned visits by civil servants to SARS-affected areas including mainland China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control puts the number of local "probable cases" at 13, most of them reporting the illness following trips to mainland China and Hong Kong. The mysterious illness has now infected some 1,900 people in 22 countries and territories and killed at least 63, including 34 people in mainland China. cs/th Health-pneumonia-China-Taiwan
