The US-led war against Irag is likely to push North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, a Russian deputy foreign minister said Tuesday. "Unfortunately the Iraqi situation is driving the North Koreans to strengthen their defences," the Interfax news agency quoted Alexander Losyukov as saying. Asked if he meant that North Korea would seek to acquire nuclear weapons, Losyukov replied that "this is absolutely clear, and the absence of a negotiating process significantly increases this danger." bb/hm/yad Iraq-war-Russia-NKorea
