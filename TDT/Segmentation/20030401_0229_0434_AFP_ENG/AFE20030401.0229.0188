Ireland's main opposition party Fine Gael plans to ask the country's parliament to fund more humanitarian aid in Iraq, a spokesman said Tuesday. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny has written to the leaders of all political parties seeking support for a parliamentary motion for new funding, the spokesman said. The motion, which does not specify how much extra cash should be given, also calls on the government to ensure that the United Nations plays the lead role in dealing with the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the spokesman said. The Irish government last week allocated five million euros (5.3 million dollars) in aid for Iraq from the country's 23 million euro (25 million dollars) global humanitarian assistance budget. ab/pk/yad Iraq-war-Ireland-aid
