South African newspapers took advantage of April Fools Day Tuesday to offer their readers some lighter coverage of the war in Iraq, including a report that Saddam Hussein has been offered asylum in South Africa. Johannesburg-based newspaper Beeld reported that President Thabo Mbeki had offered Saddam asylum and a senior post in the South African fuel industry, which would see the Iraqi leader administering South Africa's fuel prices. As part of the package Saddam would be offered a luxury game farm near the fuel producing town of Sasolburg in the Free State province, the Afrikaans-language daily wrote. Saddam would be flown from Iraq in Mbeki's presidential jet. Coalition aircraft would escort him to the edge of Iraqi airspace, but Saddam had insisted that a missile defence system be fitted to the jet, the paper wrote. The report said the Iraqi government would foot half the bill for the missile system. The US government was said to be excited about the offer because it would make Saddam "someone else's problem". The Sowetan newspaper, meanwhile, reported that South Africa was Saddam's "preferred destination" and Iraqi officials were in the country seeking suitable accommodation for their leader. "It is believed that several government guest houses in South Africa, normally reserved for visiting dignitaries, have already been examined by Iraqi protocol officicials as possible homes for their president," the newspaper said. Other newspapers jested about a change in the law that has forced South African motorists to convert their conventional drivers' licences into credit card form. The Pretoria News and the Johannesburg-based Star reported that cyclists now had six months to get a riding licence. "They (cyclists) will have to undergo an eye test as it is just as important for a cyclist to see a motor vehicle driver," a Transport Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying. The Johannesburg-based Citizen reported that all South African dogs would have to be licenced and registered within six months under a draft Canine Registration Bill. "Howls of outrage are anticipated as several cities, including Johannesburg, also plan to ban dogs from all public places," the newspaper said. Meanwhile, an SABC radio news bulletin reported that South African world number two golfer Ernie Els was quitting golf to take up boxing. srg/kdz SAfrica-media-AprilFool
