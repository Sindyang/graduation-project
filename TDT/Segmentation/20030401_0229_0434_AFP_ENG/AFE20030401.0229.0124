Munich Re, the world's biggest insurer, is planning to issue a 20-year bond in mid-April to bolster its financial position, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. The spokesman did not reveal any details regarding the size of the issue, but the newspapers Sueddeutsche Zeitung and Financial Times Deutschland reported it would raise an estimated three billion euros (3.3 billion dollars). The spokesman said it would be denominated largely in euros, but Munich Re was also considering issuing part of it in other currencies. Munich Re would have the right to call in the bond after a minimum of 10 years. The reinsurance giant urgently needs to bolster its finances after it was forced to write down its share portfolio to the tune of 5.7 billion euros last year. However, the stock markets seem to be sceptical that a bond issue will be sufficient to replenish the group's financial reserves and Munich Re shares have lost about a third of their value in about a week. On Tuesday, however, they were enjoying a technical rebound, notching up gains of 5.41 percent to 55.20 euros in a slightly firmer market. spm/hd Germany-insurance-company-finance-bonds-MunichRe
