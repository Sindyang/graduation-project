Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon appears to have ruled out manager Alex Ferguson making any big buys this summer. Kenyon, who announced reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the six months to the end of January, said United were unlikely to match the 30 million pound (47 million dollar) fee they paid Leeds United for England defender Rio Ferdinand last July. Ferguson has spent almost 80 million pounds (126 million dollars) on Ferdinand, Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy over the past 18 months. And last month he hinted he was prepared to off-load players like Ryan Giggs to help finance another splurge in the transfer market. But Kenyon said Tuesday any more mammoth buys were out of the question. "Certainly from Manchester United's perspective we believe these kind of sums to buy players are a thing of the past," he said. "Hindsight is a wonderful thing but we are now seeing transfer prices come down. Buying Rio was the right decision at the time and it remains so. "He fitted into the right age profile and we look upon him as a long term investment. "We made the decision to buy him in light of our overall wage structure and transfer budget we set ourselves and we achieved those targets," he added. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-transfers
