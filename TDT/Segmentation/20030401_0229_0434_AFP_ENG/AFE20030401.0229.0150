The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTA) has decided to suspend overseas advertisements meant to bring tourists to the city after the outbreak of a deadly pneumonia that has made hundreds sick in the former British territory. "We have deciced to suspend most overseas advertisement as the climate is not right to promote Hong Kong abroad" Simon Clennell, HKTA spokesman, said, citing fears of Severe Acute Respiratory Sydrome (SARS), known commonly as atypical pneumonia. With the onset of SARS, which is blamed for at least 62 deaths worldwide, several countries issued travel warnings to steer clear of the city. "It is not cost effective to do active overseas promotion at the moment. Atypical pneumonia has changed everything," Clennell told AFP. "When time is right, which will not be too far ahead, we will resume the promotion." The disease has so far claimed 15 lives in Hong Kong and infected 610 in this city of 6.8 million. Hong Kong has been at the centre of a worldwide alert over SARS since an American businessman, who had visited China and Vietnam, succumbed to the illness here on March 13. The authorities have already taken the extraordinary step of isolating an entire housing block for 10 days after around 200 residents there were found to be infected. The outbreak of the killer pneumonia virus in Hong Kong has devastated the key tourism sector. Travel agencies have reported that new bookings have decreased as much as 90 percent, with hotel occupancy dropping some 30 percent. Hong Kong-based carriers Cathay Pacific and Dragonair have also cancelled some regional flights due to a drop in bookings. Hong Kong had been looked upon with envy at the start of 2003 after it announced tourist numbers soared 20.7 percent to 16.6 million in 2002 on the back of a surge in mainland Chinese visitors. The local tourism industry also suffered another severe blow with the cancellation of concerts in Hong Kong by rocker Carlos Santana and pop star Moby just days after The Rolling Stones axed shows in Hong Kong over the weekend. Clennell also said overseas advertisements for Hong Kong would not be effective because of the war in Iraq, athough this had been anticipated earlier. pl/sdm/rcw Health-pneumonia-HongKong-tourism
