Jordan supected Iraqi diplomats whom it expelled last month of plotting to poison water supplies serving military bases near the Iraqi border used by US service personnel, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. "The Iraqi diplomats expelled on March 23 were conspiring to poison water mains serving the east of Jordan," where most of the US forces deployed in the kingdom are based, one of the sources told AFP, declining to be identified. The source did not elaborate on the nature of the poison said to have been involved in the plot. Jordan originally expelled five embassy staff but later lifted the expulsion order against two of them. King Abdullah II also made clear the following day that Jordan was ready to allow Iraq to name replacements for those kicked out. rh/kir Iraq-war-Jordan-diplomats-poison
