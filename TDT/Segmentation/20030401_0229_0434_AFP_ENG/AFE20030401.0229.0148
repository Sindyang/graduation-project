Bangladesh has posted doctors at the country's two major airports to screen passengers for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a health official said here Tuesday. "We have no report of any SARS cases, but vigilance has been increased," a government health official told AFP. "One doctor has been posted at each of the country's two major airports in Dhaka and in Chittagong along with a nurse from the government public health office," he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed Singapore, Toronto, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanxi and Guangdong as affected areas. The mysterious illness has infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62 people. nq/gt/an/cl Health-pneumonia-Bangladesh
