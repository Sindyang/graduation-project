Four Islamic militants and an activist of India's main opposition party were killed in separatist-related violence in restive Indian-administered Kashmir overnight, a police spokesman said Tuesday. He said Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh of the Congress party was shot dead at his home by suspected Muslim rebels in the Kreeri area of the northern Baramulla district late Monday. Sheikh is the second political activist to have been shot dead in the last two days in Baramulla. A ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) worker was shot dead by suspected rebels on Sunday. The PDP and Congress swept the long-ruling National Conference from power in state elections in September-October last year. Rebels have targeted activists of both parties since the polls. Meanwhile, Indian troops shot dead four militants in two gun battles in the southern district of Anantnag late Monday. Three of the four militants were killed in Kapran village, near Kulgam township, 70 kilometres (44 miles) south of the summer capital Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding some arms and ammunition were also recovered. The Indian security forces say over 38,000 people have died in Kashmir since the eruption of anti-Indian rebellion in 1989, but separatists put the toll twice as high. str/an/sdm/pch India-Kashmir-unrest
