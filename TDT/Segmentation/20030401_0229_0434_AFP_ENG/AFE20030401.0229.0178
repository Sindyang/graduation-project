Shares in French engineering, energy and ship-building group Alstom surged by 15.6 percent in early trading here on Tuesday on rumours that a Dutch businessman might make a takeover bid. The shares in the company, which recently announced a change of strategy to strengthen its finances, rose 15.6 percent from the closing price on Monday to 1.62 euros (1.76 dollars), having shown a gain of 18.0 percent. Brokers CDC Ixis said in a note to its customers: "A Dutch financier is reported to have made an offer valuing the share at 2.0 euros (2.17 dollars) which the Alstom board has rejected. He is believed to be about to offer 2.5 euros (2.72 dollars) per share." The board has not commented on the rumours. Alstom is expected to report a loss of about 1.3 million euros (1.4 million dollars) for the year to March, is weighed down by debt of 5.0 billion euros (5.45 billion dollars) and intends to raise 600 million euros (654 million dollars) in new capital to strengthen strained cash resources. The new chief executive Patrick Kron has also announced that the group will raise 3.0 billion euros (3.27 billion dollars) through asset sales by 2005. hz/hd/yad France-engineering-energy-company-takeover-Alstom
