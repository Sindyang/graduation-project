Veteran AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini said Tuesday he wants to win the Champions League as a captain before hanging up his boots. On Monday Maldini, a European Cup winner in 1989, 1990 and 1994, signed a one-year extension to his existing contract that will keep at the Serie A club until June 2005. "I would like to raise the cup up to the sky because as captain it would mean something very special to me," said the 34-year-old former Italy international. "It's true I've been a winner three times before, but to win it as the skipper would be particularly significant." Maldini has taken a 30 per cent pay cut to remain at Milan, but insisted it was a small price to pay to stay at the club he joined as a schoolboy. "For the love of Milan I will earn less," he said. "I've extended my contract and my salary is lower. "I'm happy to do so in these difficult times and at my age it's perhaps easier to be flexible. "I'm not sure I would have been able to accept it if I were 28." Maldini said he had no desire to play abroad, despite reported interest from several European clubs. "To play my last years at a club inferior to Milan's level would not have made sense," he said. "Don't forget I was born in Milan, I've always lived here and I'm not sure how easy it would be for me settle in elsewhere. "Sometimes I think it would have been nice to move to a different country and experience new things, but I'm coming to the end of my career and I don't think I could find somewhere that is better for me than Milan. "I have a special relationship with the Milan shirt. My father was Milan captain many years ago and the Maldini story is tied to this club." Maldini made his debut for Milan on January 20, 1985 at the age of 16 against Udinese and has since spent 19 seasons at the San Siro. He has made 501 league appearances and scored 25 goals in Serie A. Maldini has played in 120 European Cup (Champions League) matches, an Italian record. In his time at Milan he has won six Italian league titles, three European Cups, four Italian Cups, three European Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups. Italy's most capped player, Maldini made 126 appearances for the Azzurri before retiring from international football after last year's World Cup in Japan and South Korea, his fourth appearance in the finals. Milan play the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final away to Dutch giants Ajax on April 8 before hosting the return on April 23. sb/ak Fbl-ITA-ACMilan-Maldini
