South Korea posted a trade deficit for the third straight month Tuesday, signalling lean times for the economy as growth targets succumb to a rising tide of gloom. The Commerce, Industry and Energy Ministry said the country's customs-cleared trade account was 362 million dollars in the red last month, due to higher oil import costs amid the war in Iraq. The deficit was in a sharp contrast with the same month a year ago when South Korea reaped a trade surplus of 1.26 billion dollars. For the three months to March, the trade account showed a 840 million dollar accumulated deficit with the shortfalls of 375 million dollars of February and 102 million dollars of January. "The trade account has recorded three straight months of shortfalls as imports are growing at a faster rate on higher oil prices," the ministry said in statement. "But it could turn to a surplus again should oil prices fall to below 30 dollars, even if the US-led war against Iraq is prolonged." A third month of trade deficit is the latest in a catalogue of bad news affecting South Korea's economy. Stock prices continue to fall, consumer confidence tumbled to a 18-month low on Monday, consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in March. Economists say this year's economic growth will fall well below four percent, compared with last year's performance of 6.2 percent. The economists warned that even a quick end to the war in Iraq might not lead to an early rebound of the South Korean economy. They cited the mounting stand-off over North Korea's nuclear programme and looming labor confrontations as factors that could undermine investment. To make the matters worse, a high-profile accounting fraud case involving SK Global, a trade arm of the country's third largest business group, the SK Group, has brought further instability to financial markets. The accounting fraud compounded the liquidity crunch faced by the country's credit card companies, many of which are owned by banks. Maturing bonds and commercial papers issued by the card companies are not being rolled over amid mounting redemption calls on bonds as most credit card firms reported losses this year due to a sharp rise in delinquencies and a cut in commissions. A senior official of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the government will convene a meeting of policy makers from later this week to address concerns over a liquidity crunch faced by credit card companies. Mounting debts owed by credit card companies, including bonds issued by them, which stood at 89 trillion won (7.1 billion dollars) as of December last year, have emerged as a main source of jitters in the financial markets. Byeon Yang-Ho, director of financial policy division at the Finance and Economy Ministry, said the government will convene the meeting to discuss measures aimed at easing concerns over credit card companies. "Of the debts owed by credit companies, there are little problem debts," Byeon said, adding that the companies have run little risks of going insolvent. "We need to take some measures to assure the markets that these companies are viable, to enhance their profitability and ease the short-term liquidity crunch," he said. ckp/cw/dv SKorea-economy
