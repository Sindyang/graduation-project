Five people are confirmed dead and 22 are missing after a mudslide triggered by heavy rain hit homes in the eastern Indonesian island of Flores, police said Tuesday. The residents were asleep when the mudslide -- triggered by a day-long storm -- swept through the Roworeke area near the town of Ende early Monday, a local policeman said. "The fifth body was found today and we fear the other 22 people are no longer alive," Brigadier Pius told AFP from Ende. He said the mudslide also destroyed a bridge on the road between Ende and Maumere. Another five people were killed last week when a cliff collapsed on them in the island after they fled their homes during an earthquake. vt/sm/sdm/th Indonesia-landslide
