Alexander Chivadze will stand as Georgia's coach after Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier against Switzerland, the Georgian Football Association chief Merab Zhordania said Tuesday. "Chivadze told me he decided to step down from his post immediately after the qualifying clash with Switzerland regardless of the result of the match," Zhordania said. Chivadze found himself on the receiving end of a heavy wave of criticism following his side's second consecutive defeat in qualifying campaign at the hands of Ireland on Saturday. Georgia are currently anchored bottom of the Group 10 table with two defeats in two games. nt/af/ak Fbl-Eur2004-GEO-Chivadze
