Muslim separatist guerrillas have launched fresh attacks in the southern Philippines, killing one person, wounding four others and burning a chapel, officials said Tuesday. More than two dozen MILF guerrillas raided the town of Sapad, located 780 kilometers (484 miles) south of Manila, late Monday, killing one resident and clashing with government militiamen. The rebels looted and burned some houses, as well as torched a village chapel, the military report said. Another MILF band fired rocket-propelled grenades at dawn Tuesday at the quarters of a military engineering battalion in Matanog town, located 850 kilometers (527 miles) south of Manila, Major General Generoso Senga said. The attack wounded a captain, two soldiers and the wife of a soldier, Senga said. Eid Kabalu, spokesman of the 12,500-strong MILF, confirmed that Muslim guerrillas attacked Sapad and Matanog but denied that they burned the chapel. He also said the MILF forces had been targeting the government militiamen in Sapad and that the villager had been killed in the crossfire. The new MILF attacks came despite an announcement on Sunday that the government and the rebels had agreed to resume formal peace negotiations toward a political settlement to the 25-year conflict. Kabalu downplayed the new agreement, saying, "That is nothing but cosmetics. They should halt offensives against the MILF first," before peace talks can proceed. He demanded that the military withdraw from areas recently captured from the MILF if the talks were to resume. strs/mm/jvg/sdm Philippines-Muslim
