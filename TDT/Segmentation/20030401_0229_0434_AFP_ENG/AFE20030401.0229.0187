Vietnam's finance minister has proposed the National Assembly should add motorcycles to a list of goods subjected to taxes of between 20 and 50 percent, a ministry official said here Tuesday. The proposals threatens to raise protests from foreign motorcycle makers, some of whom had to stop local production last year due to a sudden change of government policy on the importation of parts kits. Nguyen Sinh Hung told a conference of full-time National assembly deputies in Hanoi on Monday that raising tax rates for motorbikes should enable Vietnam to pledge to the tariff reductions set by the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement. It would also allow the government to keep the number of motorbikes in the country to around 13 million in the coming years, he added. Hung was quoted in Vietnam News Agency (VNA) as saying the National assembly Standing Committee suggested a tax rate of 50 percent be applied on luxury motorbikes and 20 percent for popular motorbikes. The new parliamentary session is due to open on May 3 in Hanoi. If adopted, the decison is likely to intensify protests from motorcycle producers, who have been at loggerheads with the authorities for six months. The stand-off began in September last year when the trade ministry announced it was slashing the number of parts kits that bike assemblers could import during the year from 2.5 million to 1.5 million. Assembly lines at Honda's plant ground to a halt in September and Yamaha followed suit in October after running out of parts kits. The government ended the dispute in November by allowing the importation of another 185,000 motorcycle kits. But the government upset the industry again early January, when it changed it import tax system on motorcycle component parts to levy a flat 50 percent for motorbike parts and 100 percent for fully-assembled bikes. dla/ltl/bro Vietnam-auto
