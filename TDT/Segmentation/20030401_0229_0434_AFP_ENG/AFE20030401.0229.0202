India-based Myanmar activists asked New Delhi Tuesday to withdraw a long-pending case against a journalist from Myanmar who allegedly hijacked a plane. Around 150 people held a demonstration here to pressure the government to scrap the case against Soe Myint, the founder of Internet news agency Mizzima News, who is accused of commandeering the plane to draw attention to the plight of his people under Myanmar's military regime. The case is due to open Wednesday in the eastern state of West Bengal. In 1990 Soe Myint, along with another activist, diverted a Thai Airways Bangkok-Yangon flight to Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal. The activists say the two did not use violence during the incident and gave themselves up to the Indian authorities. No charges were made against them at the time and they were freed soon after. But 13 years later, the West Bengal government suddenly decided to revive the case against Myint last month and charged him with hijacking. Activists had previously claimed the charges were brought under pressure from Yangon. "If he is found guilty, he could get life imprisonment," said demonstrator Ko Moe. "Free Soe Myint; We need India's support," the protestors shouted. The other activist had left India long ago. In 1998 hundreds of thousands of people from Myanmar fled the country, then called Burma, during a crackdown by the regime after an uprising against 30-year-old military rule. According to estimates, there are more than 50,000 people from Myanmar living as refugees in India. pg/an/sdm/th India-Myanmar
