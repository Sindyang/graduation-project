A Japanese and a European company have been shortlisted for a six billion ringgit (1.6 billion dollar) contract to build a coal power plant in Malaysia, an industry source said Tuesday. "We have shortlisted two companies. We are negotiating with the two parties and seeking some clarifications," the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. The official declined to name the two companies, saying a final announcement of the winner would be made "quite soon." Four companies had been in the running for the project -- Japan's Mitsubishi and Sumitomo, Germany's Siemens and France's Alstom. Malaysia's SKS Power, which plans to develop a 2,100 megawatt coal-fired power plant in the southern Johor state to supply electricity to state utility Tenaga Nasional, had earlier said it would announce the winner by the end of March. The Tanjung Bin power station will comprise three plants of 700 megawatts each. The first plant is expected to be operational in August 2006 and the other two plants should be completed in the following year. At present there are only two coal-fired power plants in Malaysia while there are over a dozen gas-fired plants. Three-quarters of Malaysia's electricity is generated from gas while coal provides only 12 percent. jsm/lb/bro Malaysia-energy
