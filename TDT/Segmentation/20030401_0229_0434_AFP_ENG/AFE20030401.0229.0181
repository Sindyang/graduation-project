Nigeria's central labour movement said Tuesday it has suspended a strike over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on workers' demands. The three-day strike was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. "The government has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the issue of the 12.5 percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will honour the agreement this time," he added. He said the NLC took the decision to embark on what it called a warning strike because the government has repeatedly reneged on previous agreements to award workers pay hikes. Lakemfa said the central labour movement was also concerned about the forthcoming elections. "We do not want to heat up the system ahead of the general and presidential polls in April. There are lots of bad things going on such as political assassinations, long queues for petrol, that it will be unreasonable to add to the sufferings of the masses," he added. The spokesman said the NLC believes in dialogue as means of resolving trade disputes. "The NLC is always harping on dialogue because it is the only viable option to industrial peace and harmony," he said. On March 12, the NLC threatened to call a national strike from April 1 because of the government's failure to honour a pay agreement. But on Sunday, its leaders said they were backing down on the general strike for now because of the April elections in the west African country. "We have limited the strike to three days in order to ensure that the forthcoming elections are conducted peacefully," NLC's president Adams Oshiomhole told reporters. Nigeria is to hold local, governorship and presidential elections this month -- the first since the west African country returned to democracy in 1999 after more than 15 years of military rule. He said an indefinite and general strike would be launched later if the Nigerian government failed to implement a 12.5 percent pay rise for the workers. In May 2000, the government pledged a 25 percent pay rise would be awarded to workers in January 2002, but the agreement was never implemented. The government cited a flagging economy as its reason for not honouring the agreement. A joint committee of government officials and labour reduced the increase to 12.5 percent in 2002, but the government still failed to implement the agreement. joa/kdz Nigeria-social-strike
