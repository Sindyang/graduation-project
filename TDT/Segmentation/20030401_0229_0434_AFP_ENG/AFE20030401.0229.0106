A Cambodian court on Tuesday charged 13 Vietnamese with human trafficking and conspiracy in the sex trade following the dramatic rescue of 37 girls from a notorious brothel village over the weekend. Phnom Penh Court Deputy Prosecutor Khut Sopheang said 13 alleged traffickers, six men and seven women, were formally charged by the prosecutor and will have their cases transferred to judges for further investigation. "If the court finds them guilty, they will be in imprisoned for 10 to 20 years," Khut Sopheang told reporters. "They will be temporarily sent to jail, awaiting trial in the next four to six months," he said. Sopheang said one of the 13 would face an additional charge of drug trafficking, for which he could face an extra one to five years in jail, because police had found amphetamine pills in his house. The suspects were arrested and the girls rescued in a weekend operation in Svay Pak village, 11 kilometers (seven miles) north of the capital Phnom Penh, by dozens of Cambodian and American police. The major raid followed several months of investigations by a US Christian humanitarian group, International Justice Mission (IJM). Ten girls aged between five and 10, and 27 girls aged between 10 and 16 were rescued. Police had earlier said more than 20 were aged under ten, but their age had been determined after interviews, Sopheang said. The girls were being treated as victims of trafficking for sex and had been handed to the IJM, who were working closely with a coalition of non-governmental organisations on assessing their situation. Svay Pak, often dubbed K11, has earned a horrific reputation as a black hole of child-trafficking and sexual exploitation. The collection of concrete houses along a dirt road is home to hundreds of sex workers, the majority of them Vietnamese who service foreign and Cambodian clientele for as little as three dollars each. In January, police conducted a similar raid on the infamous area, aiming to shut it down for good, but no arrests were made and brothel operations quickly resumed. rs/sb/sdm Cambodia-childsex
