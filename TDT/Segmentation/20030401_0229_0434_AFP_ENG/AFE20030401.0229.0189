Finnair, Finland's state-controlled flag carrier, warned Tuesday it would post a full-year operating loss, saying an extensive cost-cutting program launched last week would not begin to take effect before 2004. Finnair said it would look for short-term savings with maximum six-week temporary layoffs, beginning at the earliest in May. It said it aimed to implement the layoffs as quickly and widely as possible without significantly cutting the level of operations. "The warning was not a big surprise as (the) market situation is very weak for airlines, in addition the second quarter is decisive for Finnair's full-year result and we are already in April," analyst Bengt Dahlstroem at Conventum Securities told AFP's financial news subsidiary AFX News. Airlines worldwide have been hard hit as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 and the slump in air travel due to the global economic downturn, a situation further exacerbated by the Iraq war. Last week, Finnair announced it would cut 10 percent of its costs, some 160 million euros, and over 10 percent of its staff, about 1,200 employees, but added that these measures would not begin to take effect before next year. In 2002, Finnair registered a net profit of 36.8 million euros, up from 7.1 million the year earlier, on sales of 1.63 billion euros, unchanged from 2001. Following the news Finnair's share price slid 4.49 percent on Monday's closing price, selling at 3.44 euros on the Helsinki stock exchange. paa/po/hd Finland-air-company-results-Finnair
