Corruption cost Bangladesh 44 billion taka (745 million dollars) in 2002, with the police heading a list of professional groups involved in graft, a watchdog body said here Tuesday. Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB), an affiliate of the Berlin-based Transparency International (TI), said the amount was equivalent to 10.38 percent of the Bangladesh's total annual budget and 67 percent of the foreign aid received in the fiscal year that ended in June 2002. TIB said its findings were based on 2,778 graft cases reported in newspapers and the 44 billion taka came from 1,047 of them. It could not find losses in the rest of the cases. Police topped the list of professionals involved in graft, followed by local government and education officials, TIB said. The watchdog said there had been a drop in graft in 2001 compared to previous year, but it increased in 2002. TIB said "political will" was the most important factor to stop corruption in Bangladesh. Setting up an anti-corruption commission and ombudsman, ensuring freedom of the press and separation of the judiciary from the executive were other important measures needed, it said. The private News Network group, in a study entitled "Endemic Corruption in Bangladesh" released last week, said at least 75 percent of foreign aid received by Bangladesh does not reach its intended target because of corruption. Last year, TI said in its annual report that Bangladesh for the second time finished bottom of the heap in an index on perceived public sector corruption. nq/gt/an/sdm/rcw Bangladesh-corruption
