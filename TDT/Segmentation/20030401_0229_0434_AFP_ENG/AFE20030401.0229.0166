Indonesia's consumer price index fell 0.23 percent in March from the previous month due to declines in food prices and rose 7.12 percent from a year earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. "Historically, March inflation is normally low. And this year food price falls were the key factor because of a good harvest supported by good weather conditions," said bureau chief Sudarti Surbakti. Food prices fell by 2.26 percent in March. The government target for inflation up to nine percent this year. bur/sm/bro Indonesia-inflation
