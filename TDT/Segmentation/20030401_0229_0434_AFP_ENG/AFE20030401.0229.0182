The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ordered US carriers to resume payments to their Philippine telecoms counterparts after a row about payments for inbound rates, the local firms said Tuesday. The FCC had previously ordered US carriers to freeze payments to six Philippine carriers for allegedly pressuring the US firms to accept higher rates. The regulatory agency had charged that the Philippine telephone firms disrupted the US-Philippine networks of the AT and T and Worldcom in retaliation for their refusal to agree to the local demand for rate increases. In retaliation, FCC's Philippine counterpart, the National Telecommunications Commission, ordered local carriers to reject calls from their US counterparts that refuse to pay them for services rendered. But Bayan Telecommunications Inc. (Bayantel) and Digital Telecommunications Philippines Inc. (Digitel) on Tuesday said they had received an order from the FCC instructing US carriers to resume payments. "With the lifting of the order, we can now resume more normal business arrangements," said Tunde Fafunwa, a financial consultant for Bayantel. "With the new ruling, it clearly indicates that all those... payments are due and that normal settlements can resume now," he added, without giving an amount on how much the US carriers owed. He said it was not clear if the FCC ruling also applied to other local carriers such as Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. and its unit Smart Communications, and Globe Telecom Inc. Digitel said it also received a copy of the ruling. Fafunwa said the dispute had "created uncertainty in the industry as a whole and between the relationship of carriers both large and small both in the US and the Philippines." But he said the carriers must "continue discussing the matter and try to settle the dispute amicably." Local carriers increased their termination rates, or share of the revenues from long-distance calls, in February, citing the need for them to be competitive. They claim that most international carriers have agreed on the rate increase, but the US firms resisted the payments leading to the dispute. jvg/cgm/dv Philippines-US-telecom
