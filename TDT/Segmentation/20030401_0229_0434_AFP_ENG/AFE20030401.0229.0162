Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand has been banned from driving for six months and fined the maximum 2,500 pounds (4,000 dollars) after notching up a string of driving offences. The 30-million pound (47 million dollar) England defender was found guilty of clocking 92mph (150kmh) on the M1 motorway last year, the Manchester Evening News reported Tuesday. He had been ordered to appear in person at a Leeds court but a district judge accepted that the 24-year-old, on international duty with England, did not have to appear and imposed the fine and restrictions in his absence. Ferdinand, who was also ordered to pay 3,000 pound costs, already had nine points on his licence from two previous speeding offences and was automatically disqualified through the "totting up" procedure. Rio, who earns 70,000 pounds (100,dollars) a week, has just signed a lucrative three-year deal with shirt-maker Ben Sherman. Manchester paid Leeds United a world record 30 million pounds for a defender for Ferdinand last July. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-PR-ManUtd-Ferdinand
