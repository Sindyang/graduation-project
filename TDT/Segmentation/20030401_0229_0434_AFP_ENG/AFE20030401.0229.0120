American Airlines has reached deals with three main unions that would allow 1.8 billion dollars in contract cost reductions, staving off a threatened bankruptcy. "By taking these decisive actions, the union leadership and our employees have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the future of the company, and have enabled us to avoid an immediate filing with the bankruptcy court," the company's chairman Don Carty said in a statement late Monday. The world's largest airline asked all employees, including management, for a total of 1.8 billion dollars in permanent, annual savings to help save the struggling and debt-ridden company and position the airline to compete more effectively in the future. The results of that effort came a day after the Allied Pilots Association announced its proposal meeting American Airlines' targets for 660 million dollars in contract cost reductions. Additional cuts in costs for the airline amount to 340 million dollars from flight attendants, 620 million from workers represented by the Transport Workers' Union, 80 million dollars from agents, representatives and planners, and some 100 million dollars from management and support staff. American Airlines had said in a statement Sunday that, "Face-to-face negotiations continue around the table, around the clock with the mechanics, flight attendants and pilots." The company also said that company chairman Carty would take a 33 percent base pay cut, decline a bonus for the third year, and ask the board of directors to significantly reduce the value of his and his senior officers compensation packages. American employees will have access to a new stock option and profit sharing program. The deal still needs approval from the unions' memberships. The company also needs to secure "meaningful concessions" from its vendors, lessors and suppliers, Carty said. "The financial condition of American is weak and its prospects remain uncertain," the company said in communications with its employees. "Particularly given the impact of the continuing war in Iraq and the different general economic conditions that are negatively impacting the industry, the days ahead will be difficult and the success of our joint efforts is not yet assured." "I would not ask for these sacrifices if I weren't convinced that they were absolutely necessary to achieve our restructuring goals," Carty said. American Airlines is only one of many US airlines in severe financial difficulties amid a general economic downturn and a slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks. The number two carrier United Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. And US Airways announced Monday its emergence from seven months of bankruptcy, after slashing 1.9 billion dollars a year in annual costs under bankruptcy court superviusion. US Airways had secured 1.24 billion dollars in financing to boost its liquidity, allowing it to meet its goals. But the airline went on to immediately warn of a new airline crisis triggered by the Iraq war. "We have taken very difficult -- some would even say impossible -- steps to restructure our company and lower our costs," US Airways president and chief executive David Siegel said in a statement. "But government imposed costs continue to strangle this industry, and the war's direct impact has been substantial," he warned. "I am very hopeful that Congress will respond with appropriate relief for the losses airlines are suffering because of the war and more stringent security requirements," he said. The US airline industry last week appealed for some four billion dollars in government aid, saying the outbreak of the Iraq war and terrorism fears had pounded air travel. bur/jlp/fgf US-air-American
