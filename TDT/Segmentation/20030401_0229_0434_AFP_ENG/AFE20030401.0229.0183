Beijing wants Manila to free 62 Chinese alleged poachers ahead of the scheduled visit next month of National People's Congress chairman Wu Bangguo, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. Wu is set to make a week-long visit to Manila from May 6 to turn over the leadership of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Union to Jose de Venecia, the speaker of the Filipino House of Representatives, the foreign department said. A diplomatic source said Beijing is seeking to have the Chinese fishermen released ahead of Wu's visit. The fishermen were arrested in two batches early last year off the northern town of Aparri and near the western island of Palawan. "It's not categorical, (but there are) hints that the visit would be more definite with a resolution of the cases of the Chinese fishermen," one source said. The sources said Manila has limited leeway because the cases of the fishermen have been filed in court. The judiciary is an independent branch of the Philippine government. "We have to see how we can facilitate their release within our laws. Enforcement of laws should always take precedence over bilateral relations," one source said. The two neighbors are rival claimants to several small islands in the South China Sea. In previous cases Manila has tried Chinese fishermen but then freed them rather than force them to serve their jail terms. str/cgm/mm/th Philippines-China
