A bomb exploded under a gas pipeline in the Indonesian city of Medan early Tuesday -- the second blast in the city in less than 24 hours -- but there were no casualties, police said. North Sumatra police spokesman Amrin Karim said the bomb was placed under a gas pipeline across a bridge over the Deli river but the explosion only dented the steel pipe and twisted its protective cage. The pipeline belongs to state energy giant Pertamina. An earlier report said the blast occurred 700 meters from the pipeline. A second bomb, which failed to explode, was found at the other end of the bridge, Karim told AFP, describing the blast as a "terror" act. On Monday afternoon a strong explosion rocked the parking lot of the Medan city administration's offices, shattering windows and damaging two cars. No one was hurt. That bomb was attached to a bicycle parked between the cars, police said. National police are investigating whether the blasts are linked to earlier explosions in Indonesia, including the Bali terror bombings last October 12 which killed 202 people. Sources quoted by the state Antara news agency said the Medan municipality had received threats from a caller related to entertainment activities held in the complex. Police said Tuesday's bombs were similar to the one that exploded on Monday. North Sumatra governor Rizal Nurdin said Monday the attack on the local government building was "an act of terror and aimed at creating restlessness." Provincial police chief Inspector General Dewa Astika said the attacks on Monday and Tuesday were related but police had yet to determine the motive. "We have increased security at vital installations and asked the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious things to police," Astika was quoted by the Detikcom online news service as saying. Indonesia has been hit by a series of bombings over the past few years. The Bali nightclub blasts were blamed on regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah. Asked if the Medan attacks were related to previous bombings, national police spokesman Edward Aritonang told AFP: "We are still gathering information. We're analysing it and we haven't come to any conclusion yet." tn/sm/rcw Indonesia-blast
