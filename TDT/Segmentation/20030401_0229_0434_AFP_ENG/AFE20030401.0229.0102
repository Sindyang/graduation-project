Japanese share prices closed slightly higher Tuesday on fresh demand associated with the new fiscal year, but with the upside capped by uncertainty over the duration of the war in Iraq, dealers said. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 index ended the first day of the new Japanese financial year up 0.18 percent or 14.01 points at 7,986.72 and the Topix index of all first section issues closed up 0.96 points at 788.96. "Yesterday, the local stockmarket was pressured by selling related to the end-March fiscal year account closure. But such selling eased today, the first day of the new fiscal year," said Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Hinode Securities. But Karikomi said the market failed to extend its gains because fears the US-led war in Iraq would be prolonged were still overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets continue to fall due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," he said. Dealers said the release of the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing a marginal deterioration in business confidence in the three months to March had little impact on the market as it was within expectations. "There was no surprise in the Tankan survey. Rather, investors were reacting to growing uncertainty over the war," said Hiroichi Nishi, senior market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities. "The market took very calmly the outcome of the Tankan which contained no surprises," Kazumasa Fukushima, strategist at Toyo Securities said. But after the survey failed to provide fresh trading leads, "we had effectively no trading of any sort before us," Fukushima added. Banks ended lower due to the recent sharp decline in share prices leading to rising latent losses in their portfolios, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group down 11,000 yen at 201,000 yen, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group 11,000 lower at 439,000, UFJ down 6,000 at 112,000, and Mizuho Financial Group losing 7,800 to 89,000. Karikomi said he did not expect banks' shares to be pressured much by concerns they will post further net losses for the year to March 2003 as such worries had been factored in. "The majority of the market participants knew that the latent securities losses of Japanese firms will increase -- that has been digested by the stockmarket," he said. Hi-techs were flat to lower, with Advantest 90 lower at 4,130 and Tokyo Electron down 60 at 4,580. Kyocera was flat at 5,880. Volume was estimated at 848 million shares. Decliners led gainers 711 to 634, with 161 stocks unchanged. bur-ja/dv Stocks-Japan
