Five thousand Thai prisoners convicted of drug offences are to build their own accommodation at rehabilitation boot camps run by the army, a military spokesman said Tuesday. "It forms part of their rehabilitation programme and aims to make them unite and learn how to work and live together," army spokesman Somkhuan Saengpattaranetr told AFP. "We also get good results for our budget," he added. Boot camps are already run by the army for teenage drug addicts, while army vocational camp programmes are also in place for prisoners who are either drug-addicts or convicted on drugs charges. Such camps are partly aimed at reducing chronic overcrowding in Thailand's jails, which is largely a result of the huge methamphetamines addiction problem the kingdom faces. The idea of getting inmates to build their own bunk-houses arose after Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra told the army that expensive accommodation should not be built in the new camps due to a lack of funds, Somkhuan said. The army was currently surveying suitable sites for the rehabilitation camps, he added. Thailand is in the midst of a three-month drugs blitz targeting methamphetamines, of which the country is the world's largest per capita consumer, according to the International Narcotics Control Bureau. Last September, then-Justice Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng said the jail system was on the brink, with just over a quarter of a million inmates behind bars despite capacity for only 150,000 people. More than 102,000 of the inmates were jailed on drug-related crimes. tp/sb/rcw Thailand-drugs-prisoners
