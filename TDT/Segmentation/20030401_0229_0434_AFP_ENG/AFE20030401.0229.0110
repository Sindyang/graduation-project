Radical student organisers vowed Tuesday to stage an anti-war rally in central Sydney on Wednesday, despite a police ban imposed after a similar protest last week turned violent. The Books Not Bombs (BNB) national coalition said its members would "defend to the death their fundamental democratic right to march the streets". Police refused to grant a march permit, fearing a repeat of last week's violence which ended with 33 youths arrested and four police injured after they were pelted with chairs, bottles and marbles. The march was organised for high school students opposed to the war in Iraq but police said "a large group of Middle Eastern males" turned up intent on causing trouble. BNB spokeswoman Kylie Moon said her organisation wanted a peaceful protest and was determined to exercise its right to free speech under international laws. "They threaten our right to speak out against the war but we will not be silenced," Moon said. Mainstream peace groups have distanced themselves from BNB, which the New South Wales (NSW) state government claims has links to anarchist and socialist organisations dedicated to violent direct action. But the group has blamed heavy-handed police tactics for last week's violence and threatened to launch a class action against authorities in NSW. Moon said legal observers and marshalls would be posted throughout the protest route tomorrow to monitor police behaviour. ns/rcw Iraq-war-demos-Australia
