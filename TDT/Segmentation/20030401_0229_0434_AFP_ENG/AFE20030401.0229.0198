AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops shot dead seven women and children at a checkpoint in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, as Baghdad came under a fresh wave of bombing targeting Saddam Hussein's hold on power. The shooting came after a night of intense bombardments on Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his 24-year rule, came under fresh bombardment on Tuesday for the second consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. The palace grounds have been a frequent target in the bombing. US forces meanwhile stepped up military operations south of Baghdad ahead of an expected major push on the Iraqi capital. The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said at operational heaquarters in Qatar. The incident was thought likely to undermine efforts to win over the Iraqi people and counter international concern over the war. Owens said the victims, seven women and children, were in a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. The Washington Post reported that 10 civilians had been killed in the incident and quoted a US Army captain as saying that the casualties were sustained because US troops "didn't fire a warning shot soon enough." "You just (expletive) killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough," US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny Johnson was heard shouting over the radio to his men after the shooting stopped, the daily reported. In Qatar, Owens countered that: "As a last resort, they (US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," adding that an investigation had been opened. US forces have been on an increased state of alert following Saturday's suicide car-bombing, also near Najaf, that killed four US soldiers. A written statement issued by US Central Command said "initial reports indicate the soldiers responded in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life," it said. The shooting was expected to fuel vocal international opposition to the 13-day-old war, which the United States says it is waging with a constant eye on keeping civilian casualties to a minimum. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments on Baghdad saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing late Monday. Villagers on the edge of the capital reported 20 more civilians dead, 11 of them children, from the blitz. A plume of smoke rose into the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the presidential compound Tuesday. AFP reporters said the raids on Baghdad were growing more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. In Kuwait, air raid sirens sounded for the first time since Saturday. A defence ministry spokesman later said an Iraqi missile had been shot down over southern Iraq. The US Army's elite 101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign around Najaf after killing several opposition fighters and taking another 20 prisoner, military officials said. The "Screaming Eagles" began the third day of their campaign to secure the areas south and north of the Shiite Muslim holy city by sending in another battalion of Apache attack helicopters to support infantry troops. The 101st began its campaign around Najaf on March 30, with the primary aim of securing the area for communication and supply lines in the US military's push towards Baghdad. Najaf and Karbala, another Shiite pilgrimage city a further 80 kilometres closer to Baghdad, are considered vital to securing major routes to Baghdad. South of the capital, US troops massing for a decisive push towards Saddam's seat of power reported their first serious fighting with the Republican Guard, considered Iraq's most determined military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came as US armoured units finalised plans for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near Najaf, to the south. In Basra, seen as key to controling the southeast, British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making a final push to take the city. British commanders said 600 soldiers backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers to the southeast of Basra, as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London said a British soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war. US authorities say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. In Amman, diplomatic sources said that Jordan supected Iraqi diplomats whom it expelled last month of plotting to poison water supplies serving military bases near the Iraqi border used by US service personnel. Jordanian authorities meanwhile arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting to blow up a luxury Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign journalists, diplomatic sources told AFP. Asian stock markets and the dollar paused to catch their breath following their latest slump but oil prices edged higher as worries over the impact of war continued to shake confidence. In Brussels, a diplomatic source said that US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers on Thursday. In Russia, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said the war was likely to fuel North Korea's nuclear ambitions. burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap
