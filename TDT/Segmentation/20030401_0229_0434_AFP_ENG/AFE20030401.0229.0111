South Korean share prices rose 0.53 percent Tuesday as retail bargain-hunting offset early weakness triggered by losses on Wall Street amid concerns over the Iraq war, dealers said. The composite index closed up 2.86 points at 538.56. Volume was 519 million shares worth 1.7 trillion won (1.35 billion dollars). "It was just a brief break on the steep downhill slope," Sejong Securities market analyst Yoo Ji-Sang said, referring to the rebound from the 3.71 percent plunge on Monday. Yoo noted that foreign investors continued to curtail down their holdings in the local bourse. "As the Iraq war is unlikely to end soon, investors have begun to be concerned about a very late economic recovery." Yoo said, adding that support at the 500-point level appeared vulnerable again. Rising stocks led falls by 449 to 292 with 76 unchanged. Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth 190.2 billion won, institutional investors net sellers of shares worth 83.0 billion and retail investors net buyers of shares worth 269.0 billion. Samsung Electronics closed unchanged at 284,000 won. SK Telecom added 5,500 to 158,500 and KT closed up 950 at 44,200. bur/jkw/dv Stocks-SKorea-close
