A court in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan Tuesday handed out stiff jail sentences to the leaders of an uprising against the country's autocratic government. Four men were imprisoned for between five and nine years after being found guilty of last year leading clashes with police in the town of Nardaran, which left one local man dead and dozens injured. Another 11 defendants also charged in relation to the clashes in Nardaran, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Baku, walked free from the court after being given suspended sentences. The case has attracted attention from western diplomats and human rights groups, who allege that Azerbaijan's government cracked down fiercely on those involved because Nardaran is an opposition stronghold. "This is an unjust decision and a violation of the constitution," Hadzhiaga Nuriyev, a village eleder from Nardaran, said outside the court. "We will use all legal means available to get this overturned." One of the convicted men, Alikram Aliyev, is the chairman of Azerbaijan's outlawed Islamic Party. He was given nine years in a penal colony. sab-clo/hm/yad Azerbaijan-protest-court
