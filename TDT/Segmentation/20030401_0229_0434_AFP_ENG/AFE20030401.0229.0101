Jordanian authorities have arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting to blow up a luxury Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign journalists, diplomatic sources told AFP Tuesday. "Four Iraqis were arrested in Amman last week for their involvement in an attempt to blow up the Hyatt Amman Hotel", one of the sources told AFP asking not to be identified. Nearly 70 foreign journalists were staying in the hotel at the time of the plot, along with many Americans staying in two adjacent tower blocks. The reason for the Americans' presence in the Jordanian capital remains unclear. rh/kir Iraq-war-Jordan-attack
