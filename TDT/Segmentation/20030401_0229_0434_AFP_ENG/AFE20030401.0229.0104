A killer pneumonia virus spreading around the globe and the US-led war against Iraq have caused a 20 percent fall-off in tourist arrivals to Cambodia, a senior government official said Tuesday. "So far, the number of tourists has decreased by around 20 percent compared to previous months," the tourism ministry's secretary of state Thong Khon told AFP. "This has been caused by the Iraq war and SARS leading to tourists worrying about their security and health," he said, referring to the atypical pneumonia, dubbed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which is sweeping the globe. SARS was causing greater unease than the war, Thong Khon said. The virus has killed at least 62 people and infected some 1,700 in 15 countries. Deaths have been recorded in mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Canada, Singapore and Thailand. There have been no reports of SARS infections in Cambodia. A number of tourists this month have cancelled their plans, said Meng Phala, secretary general for the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents. "Three or four out of every group of 15 or so tourists are cancelling their trips to Cambodia," he said, adding that his clients were mainly afraid of catching SARS by travelling in planes. The Grand Hotel d'Angkor in Siem Reap, the gateway town to the famed Angkor Wat temple complex, also reported cancellations. "Just 34 out of 131 rooms at the hotel have guests," receptionist Hong Paun said, adding that normally at this time of year 50 to 60 rooms would be filled. Health Minister Hong Sun Huot said at least three doctors were screening arrivals at Phnom Penh International Airport, with an ambulance standing by to carry anyone with SARS symptoms to Calmette Hospital for treatment. Screening was also taking place at other port and border checkpoints. Impoverished Cambodia is harbouring high hopes for tourism bringing in much-needed foreign exchange this year, targetting arrivals of one million on the back of a global "Visit Cambodia Year" campaign. Tourist arrivals jumped 30.6 percent in 2002 to 790,000. suy/sb/mlm/sdm/cl Iraq-war-health-pneumonia-Cambodia-tourism
