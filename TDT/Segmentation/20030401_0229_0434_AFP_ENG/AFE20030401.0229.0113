France's Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre says players have become pawns in the hands of the football money men out to exploit them. Silvestre, in Sicily for France's Euro 2004 qualifier against Israel on Wednesday, says the Confederations Cup in France in June denies players their one chance in the year to take a break. "There comes a time when the body cries 'Stop'," he told l'Equipe sports daily. "It's the only period where we can really rest." But he said a potential battle between clubs and national federations over releasing players for the tournament was out of the hands of players. "If the clubs, to protect their players, want to take on the federations, they will," he said "But the international players will be suspended. For us, what's important is the French national team. The players won't rebel but the decision-makers are more important than us. "We're the pawns of the managers and administrators. We're just merchandise. It's as simple as that. Everybody tries to get as much as they can for their own interests." Arsenal chief executive David Dein warned last month that if there was not a radical re-drawing of the international calendar within the next 12 months the simmering club-versus-country row would degenerate into all-out conflict. "We pay the players. We are in command of the players' salaries. They work for us first and foremost," Dein told BBC TV. "We're happy to release them but it's a question of balance. There has to be a total revolution in the fixture calendar. Otherwise the clubs will say we're not going to release our players." The first big test comes in the Confederations Cup in France. FIFA has called on Europe's top clubs to release their players for the June 18-29 tournament But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has already said his French stars Thierry Henry, Silvain Wiltord, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira need a break from football. And Real Madrid president Florentino Perez said that if Real was still in the running for their domestic title then he would not release Brazil World Cup stars Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos and French stars Zinedine Zidane and Claude Makelele for the start of the tournament. rw03 Fbl-FRA-Silvestre
