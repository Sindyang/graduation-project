French household confidence fell further in March for the third month in a row and to the lowest point for six years, official data showed on Tuesday against a background of concern about weakness in the economy. An indicator by the statistics service INSEE showed that household confidence had fallen to minus 32 from minus 26 in February. INSEE said that pessimism about the outlook for unemployment was at a "historic high point" but that households were slightly more confident than previously about their ability to save. The data was collected from March 1 to March 19 just before the outbreak of the war in Iraq. The government has shown increasing concern in the last week that prospects for growth this year, already reduced sharply at the beginning of March, are fading and that tax cuts have stimulated savings rather than consumption which was the main pillar of growth last year. od/hd/yad France-economy-consumer-confidence
