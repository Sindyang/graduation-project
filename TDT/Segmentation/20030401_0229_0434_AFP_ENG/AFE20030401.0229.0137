Britain might wait until 2006 before holding a referendum on whether to join the euro zone, European Commission vice president Neil Kinnock was quoted as predicting on Tuesday. Kinnock, a former leader of Britain's governing Labour Party who maintains close ties with Prime Minister Tony Blair and other top figures, told the Financial Times that a referendum was likely in the current parliament. However it might not happen until shortly before the latest possible date for a general election, June 2006. The British government's five self-imposed economic tests seen as necessary to join the euro, due to be completed by this June, were likely to be met, Kinnock told the newspaper. However it was likely that more time would be taken to assess the overall economic and fiscal situation. "I think the answer to the tests will be: 'Yes, but when certain things have been accomplished'," he said. "I think the assessment will be positive. But what we won't have in June is: 'Yes, and here's the date for our referendum'." Kinnock, 61, dismissed the idea that Blair might take advantage of any post-Iraq war euphoria to push through a referendum, saying this notion showed a "complete misunderstanding of the psyche and politics of Tony Blair." The most likely date was late 2005 or early 2006, he told the paper. "It would give you just a bit of extra time to focus public opinion on the facts," he said. Blair's government is pushing for Britain to join the European single currency, but is moving very cautiously against a thus far strongly negative public, which is showing great resistance to scrapping the British pound. The opposition Conservative Party strongly opposes euro membership and is keen to exploit any electoral advantage that might occur through a swift timetable towards euro accession. Kinnock added that in his opinion Blair had perhaps not done enough to begin preparing public opinion in what has generally been quite a shrill debate in Britain. "Not enough opportunities have been taken to provide dispassionate and objective information," he said. pw/hd Britain-forex-EU-eurozone-referendum-Kinnock
