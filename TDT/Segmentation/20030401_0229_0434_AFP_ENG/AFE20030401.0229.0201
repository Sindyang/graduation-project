The US-led war against Irag is likely to push North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, a Russian deputy foreign minister said Tuesday. "Unfortunately the Iraqi situation is driving the North Koreans to strengthen their defences," the Interfax news agency quoted Alexander Losyukov as saying. Asked if he meant that North Korea would seek to acquire nuclear weapons, Losyukov replied that "this is absolutely clear, and the absence of a negotiating process significantly increases this danger." Russia is trying to organise direct talks between North Korea and the United States over the crisis concerning North Korea's nuclear programme. Washington has rejected such talks, saying that an agreement must be found jointly by all regional powers. "The North Koreans have already said that if they feel threatened, they will do whatever is necessary for their protection, including the creation of certain powerful weapons," Losyukov said. "North Korea clearly sees events in Iraq as a threat. I fear that the present situation in Iraq is pushing them in a direction that will harm the interests of stability and security," he said. On Monday Losyukov called on South Korea to provide a "sobering influence" on the United States in the nuclear standoff with the Communist North. Speaking after talks in Moscow with Ra Jong-Yil, the senior advisor for national security to South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun, Losyukov said that only direct negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington could resolve the crisis. bb/hm/yad Iraq-war-Russia-NKorea
