The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTA) on Tuesday suspended its tourism advertisements overseas due to the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory disease. HKTA spokesman Simon Clennell said the decision was taken because "the climate is not right to promote Hong Kong abroad". "It is not cost effective to do active overseas promotion at the moment," Clennell told AFP. "Atypical pneumonia has changed everything." "When the time is right, which will not be too far ahead, we will resume the promotion," he said. Hong Kong is at the centre of the global outbreak Severe Acute Respiratory Sydndrome (SARS), which has infected some 1,700 people in 15 countries and killed at least 62. The disease has so far claimed 15 lives in the former British colony. Hong Kong authorities have taken the extraordinary step of isolating an entire housing block for 10 days in an attempt to control the epidemic after about 200 residents were found to be infected. Clennell said Hong Kong's tourism industry was also hit by the US-led war in Iraq. Travel agencies have reported that new bookings have slumped up to 90 percent, with hotel occupancy rates also dropping some 30 percent. Hong Kong-based carriers Cathay Pacific and Dragonair have also cancelled some regional flights due to a drop in bookings. The territory had been looked upon with envy at the start of 2003 after it announced tourist numbers soared 20.7 percent to 16.6 million for 2002 on the back of a surge in mainland Chinese visitors. The local tourism industry also suffered another severe blow with the cancellation of concerts in Hong Kong by guitarist Carlos Santana and pop star Moby just days after The Rolling Stones axed shows in Hong Kong over the weekend. pl/dv Health-pneumonia-HongKong-tourism
