Nigeria's central labour movement said Tuesday it has suspended a strike over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on workers' demands. The three-day strike was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. "The government has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the issue of 12.5 percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will honour the agreement this time," he added. He said the NLC took the decision to embark on what it called a warning strike because the government has repeatedly reneged on previous agreements to award workers pay hikes. Two weeks ago, the NLC threatened to order a national strike from April 1, but its leaders said Sunday they were backing down on the general strike for now because of the April elections in the west African country. joa/kdz Nigeria-social-strike
