Hundreds of police and paramilitary troops patrolled the southern Pakistani town of Kashmoor Tuesday as tensions simmered over the killing of 14 people in a tribal feud, police said. Most shops and markets remained closed in Kashmoor, a remote town at the junction of Punjab, Sindh and Baluchistan provinces, where over a dozen gunmen killed 14 people and injured 20 on Monday. "The situation is tense and police and rangers are patrolling the city as part of preventive measures," local police officer Tahir Nasir told AFP by telephone. A long-standing feud between the Mazari and Bugti tribes erupted on Monday when more than a dozen heavily armed Bugti tribesmen drove up to the home of an elder of the Mazari clan, Sohrab Khan, and opened fire, killing Khan and several associates. As they fled the assailants also fired at a nearby bus stand, causing more casualties. Among the dead was a child shot dead at the bus stand, provincial police chief Syed Kamal Shah said. Witnesses said hundreds of angry Mazari tribesmen were prowling the streets late Monday demanding the arrest of the attackers. They blocked the national highway and burnt tyres on the road. Fighting between Mazaris and Bugtis, influential tribes from Baluchistan, disrupted key gas pipelines and severed gas supplies to northern and eastern Pakistan in January and February when rockets used in the battles ruptured the pipelines. mz/bc/sdm/th Pakistan-clash
