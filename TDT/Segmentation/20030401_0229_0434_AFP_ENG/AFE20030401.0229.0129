Some 400 police launched a series of raids Tuesday in the northern German city of Hamburg aimed at dismantling a people-smuggling racket, the interior ministry said. In a communique in Berlin, it said the Algerian-led network is believed to have set up in Hamburg in October last year. It said the group also had links in Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as Algeria and Germany. km/yad Germany-immigration
