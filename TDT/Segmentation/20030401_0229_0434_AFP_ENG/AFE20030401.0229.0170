An American business group on Tuesday urged the US Congress to normalise trade ties with Laos, stressing the importance of Southeast Asia to US political, economic and security interests. Establishment of normal trade relations (NTR) with Laos would be in the United States' national interest as it could stem the illegal export of narcotics, the US-ASEAN Business Council said. It could also lead to lowering of tariffs by Laos, which has the highest rates in the world averaging 45.3 percent, exceeding North Korea's 35 percent, and help the impoverished Southeast Asian nation gain entry into the World Trade Organisation, the council said. ASEAN is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations which groups Laos along with Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The council represents 150 US firms doing business in ASEAN, a market of 500 million people. Council president Ernest Bower has written to Philip M. Crane, chairman of the subcommittee on trade, committee on ways and means at the US House of Representatives to voice the group's support for the normalisation of trade ties with Laos. The subcommittee has been soliciting comments before Congress moves to ratify a US-Laos bilateral trade agreement negotiated in 1997. Bower said in his letter that "the importance of the ASEAN region to American political, economic and security interests is increasing and there is a lot that needs to be done to increase our engagement of ASEAN and its member nations." Normalising trade ties with Laos is achievable within this year, he said in the letter, a copy of which was received by AFP here. "Laos now exports garments, gems and jewelry, agricultural products, hydro-electricity, timber, labor and narcotics (illegally)," Bower said. "As a matter of US national interest, if we would like Laos to export less in the last three categories, we have to help them export more in the first four. NTR is key to that," he said. Laos however must provide US firms and their own companies with the "legal framework and operational authority" for successful trade and investments. The Lao government must also continue efforts to stem the illegal flow of narcotics and address issues related to prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action during the Indochina war. mba/bh/bro ASEAN-Laos-US
