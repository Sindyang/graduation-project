A British bomb disposal soldier has died while on duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war on Iraq 13 days ago, the defence ministry announced on Tuesday. The soldier died on Monday "in the course of his duties," a ministry spokesman told AFP. A message on the ministry of defense's website said: "A soldier was killed in southern Iraq on March 31 during an explosive ordnance disposal operation. His family have been informed." Twenty five other British soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war nearly two weeks ago, 15 of them in accidents. Five have been killed by friendly fire and five have died in combat. ib-msa/yad Iraq-war-Britain-casualties
