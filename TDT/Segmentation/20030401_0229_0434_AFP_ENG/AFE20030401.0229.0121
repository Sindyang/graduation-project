Scotland's Colin Montgomerie has withdrawn from this week's BellSouth Classic in Atlanta after a poor six weeks in the USA and has returned home to "recharge his batteries". He made only one cut, at the Bay Invitational, and failed by one shot to qualify for the last two rounds at the Players Championship. "He is disappointed to let down the BellSouth Classic, but he just wants to recharge his batteries," his manager Guy Kinnings told BBC Online. "Monty wants to spend some time working on his game. "He has spent a lot of time in America and believes it would be better to be at home for a week, before flying back out for the Masters." His place at the BellSouth Classic has gone to Paul Lawrie. bur/rw03 Golf-USPGA-Montgomerie
