Indonesia's human rights record remained poor last year and serious abuses continued, the US State Department said. "Soldiers and police murdered, tortured, raped, beat and arbitrarily detained both civilians and members of separatist movements," the department said in the Indonesia section of its worldwide human rights report released Monday. It singled out the armys special forces Kopassus and the Brimob police paramilitary unit for particular censure. Abuses by security forces were most apparent in Aceh province where some 898 fighters and civilians were killed during the year, the report said. The State Department also criticised the separatist Free Aceh Movement rebels, saying they had killed, tortured, raped, beat and illegally detained civilians and members of the security forces during 2002. Security force members also committed severe abuses in other conflict zones such as Papua, the Maluku islands and Central Sulawesi "but at reduced levels compared with the previous year." The State Department rapped a human rights court, which was set up following the army-backed militia violence against independence supporters in East Timor in 1999. The court had acquitted 10 security force members and a civilian as of end-March. Five people -- two army officers, a former Dili police chief, the former civilian governor and an ex-militia chief -- had been ordered jailed. All are free pending appeals. "The tribunals performance (as of year-end) reinforced the impression that impunity would continue for soldiers and police who committed human rights abuses," the State Department said. It said the government's failure to meet statutory deadlines in preparing cases for the court "represented a major procedural violation that could provide grounds to overturn convictions on appeal." The report noted a reduced death toll in most conflict zones but said the government "largely failed to deter social, inter-ethnic and inter-religious violence." Mob vigilante action and religious groups purporting to uphold public morality continued to dispense "street justice," it said. Widespread corruption continued throughout the legal system with bribes influencing prosecution, conviction and sentencing. The report noted that the government had passed a child protection act and related legislation. "However, child labor and sexual abuse remained major problems and implementation of the law remained weak." People-trafficking, particularly for prostitution, remained a significant problem, the State Department said. sm/rcw US-rights-Indonesia
