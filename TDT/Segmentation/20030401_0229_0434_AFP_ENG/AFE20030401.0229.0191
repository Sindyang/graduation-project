Hong Kong share prices closed 0.44 percent lower on Tuesday due to continued fears about the rapid spread of a killer virus, dealers said. The key Hang Seng index lost 37.56 points to close at 8,596.89 on turnover of 8.49 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.1 billion US). Dealers said the downside narrowed at the market close after the government rejected rumours it will declare Hong Kong an infected area. "Market sentiment was very weak because of the fears over SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)... there were also rumours that the government may declare Hong Kong an infected area," said Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities. "There was a bit of rebound towards the market close after the government rejected the rumours, but the Hang Seng index should continue to trade on a downward bias," he said. The rumours have also prompted residents to flock supermarkets for food provisions, but Health Secretary Margaret Chan said: "I wish to inform the people that Hong Kong Special Administrative Region categorically has no plan and no need to declare an infected area." The rumours coincided with April Fool's Day. Amsteel Securities executive director Freddie Kwan said he expects the Hang Seng to see near-term support at about 8,200 points. "Sharp declines are unlikely in the near term, given that the local market has been heavily oversold in the previous trading sessions," Kwan said.
