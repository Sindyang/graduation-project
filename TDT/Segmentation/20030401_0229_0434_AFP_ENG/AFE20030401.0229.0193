Croatia's world champion skier Ivica Kostelic and his girlfriend, American racer Caroline Lalive, who is recovering in Croatia from injuries, have gone their separate ways, they said Tuesday. "It's true that Caroline and I have broke up," Kostelic said. The couple have kept their relationship alive from afar, with long phone calls and have been meeting mostly at ski events and during Lalive's visits to Croatia since they started dating 15 months ago. Last week 24-year-old Lalive arrived in the tourist resort of Selce at the invitation of Ivica and Janica Kostelic to recover from the injuries she sustained in the last World Cup race. "I broke up with Ivica and for several reasons. It is hard to sustain a relationship from afar and also I had this serous injury," said Lalive. Lalive is keeping company in Selce with Kostelic's superstar sister Janica who is recovering from knee surgery. str-zbl/ak Ski-CRO-USA-Kostelic-People
