The chief secretary to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has retired from government, state media said Tuesday. Charles Utete, 65, joined the then prime minister's office in 1981 which later transformed into the president's office in 1987, as secretary. He has held the same post throughout his career. "This place is challenging and one does not want to go on until one does not have energy or strength," he said. "I need to rest a bit. I want to take time for a break and reflect on things," Utete was quoted as saying by the Herald. His retirement came as the southern African country faces serious political and economic crises. Mugabe is under increasing pressure to resolve the country's woes, which include more than three-quarters of the population living in abject poverty, triple-digit inflation, and a famine that has affected more than two thirds of the country's 11.6 million people. sn/stb/kdz Zimbabwe-politics
