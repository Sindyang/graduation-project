European stocks regained a little ground in early trading on Tuesday following sharp falls the previous day, bucking a downward trend on Wall Street overnight. The British FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 0.8 percent to 3,642.0 points, the German DAX 30 index rebounded 1.3 percent to 2,454.7 points and the French CAC 40 index rose 1.2 percent to 2,649.9 points. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading euro-zone shares -- which had plunged 4.5 percent on Monday -- edged up 0.6 percent to 2110.7. The rebound comes despite a slide for shares in New York on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones industrials average of 30 top stocks drop 1.89 percent and the Nasdaq index decline just over two percent. Dealers there had taken fright at the prospect of a drawn-out, bloody war in Iraq, as well as a multi-billion dollar legal threat to tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, part of the Altria group. The news in Asia was mixed, with Hong Kong's key Hang Seng index dropping around one percent by Tuesday afternoon trading while Japanese prices closed 0.18 percent higher Tuesday on fresh demand associated with the country's new fiscal year. pw/hd Stocks-Europe
