All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu has been forced to take a four-week break from rugby after a flare-up of his chronic kidney problem. "Jonah's health is paramount and his doctors have recommended that he take a full break from rugby so that he can receive the appropriate medical treatment," New Zealand Rugby Union deputy chief executive Steve Tew said Tuesday. "Our aim is to help Jonah get back to full health and back on the rugby field." He was replaced at half-time in Hurricanes' 24-14 win over the Chiefs last week. The 27-year-old was diagnosed as having nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996 and he has been receiving regular treatment. "This is a chronic intermittent condition which has fluctuated over the last six or seven years," Mayhew said. "We are hopeful that the modifications in his treatment will enable him to return to rugby in the near future. We will re-evaluate the situation after four weeks." All Blacks coach John Mitchell said everyone hoped to see Lomu back soon. "We wish him well in his recovery," he said. Lomu, rugby's biggest star since shooting to fame as a 19-year-old at the 1995 World Cup, missed an entire season after initially having the problem diagnosed. His form has fluctuated since coming back and he has been in and out of the New Zealand All Black and Hurricane Super 12 sides. But he looked to be back to his best on the All Blacks tour of Europe last November, scoring twice in the defeat to England. mjf/rw/ak RugbyU-NZL-Lomu
