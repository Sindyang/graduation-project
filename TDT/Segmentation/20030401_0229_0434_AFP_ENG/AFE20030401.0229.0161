ISLAMABAD, April 1 (AFP) - US sanctions on Pakistan's top nuclear research facility over alleged technology-sharing with North Korea are fuelling a popular theory that Washington plans to deal with Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction once it has finished with Iraq. "It's possible these are signals that Pakistan has to fall in line or it could be the target in the future," A.H. Nayyar, an analyst from the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, told AFP. The US announced Monday it had slapped sanctions on A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), a uranium enrichment plant near Islamabad, and North Korea, following months of claims by intelligence officials that Pakistan had supplied the Stalinist state with uranium enrichment technology for its controversial nuclear program, in exchange for missiles. US officials did not publicy link Islamabad and Pyongyang, but one Washington official said on condition of anonymity the sanctions were because of their alleged bilateral weapons trade, adding: "You connect the dots." "There has already been much talk of Pakistan becoming a target after Iraq," The News daily wrote Monday in response to the KRL ban. "That might be leaping to premature conclusions but Pakistan needs to be wary of the direction of its relationship with the USA." The "Pakistan next" theory has been bandied around for months in newspaper editorials, and politicians have bought into it as anti-US hostility swells among Pakistanis enraged at perceived US aggression and perceptions of ingratitude from Washington for Pakistan's pivotal war on terrorism role. Even President Pervez Musharraf gave it currency when he told businessmen on January 18 "there were chances" that Pakistan would become a target of Western forces after Iraq. "We will have to work on our own to stave off the impending danger," Musharraf said. "Cynics would say the axis of evil includes Pakistan also," Institute of Regional Studies researcher Khalid Mahmud told AFP, referring to US President George W. Bush's description of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. "There are many in Pakistan who say that after Iraq, the US will turn its attention to other countries and on the hit list are Iran, Syria, North Korea and maybe Pakistan also. "So (the KRL sanctions) may be an indicator of things to come." Mahmud said the main factors feeding the "Pakistan next" theory were the combination of Pakistan's possession of weapons of mass destruction and the rise of Islamic fundamentalists. "From the beginning this nuclear program has been branded an 'Islamic bomb' which poses a direct threat to Israel," Mahmud said. "The other irritant is the rise of religious extremist forces. These two irritants could be the basis of the US aggressive posture vis-a-vis Pakistan." Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri brushed off concerns that Washington had Pakistan's nuclear program in its sights. "We are not the next target, as we are a responsible state," he told reporters. Proponents of the "Pakistan next" theory point to the policy of pre-emption embraced by Washington in its attempt to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and its goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction. Musharraf is embraced by the US as a "tight" ally in its 18-month campaign against the Taliban and al-Qaeda and the ongoing hunt for fugitives from the extremist groups. But the spectre of Pakistan's home-grown extremists or fundamentalist Islamists getting their hands on its estimated 30 to 50 nuclear warheads is why the US is paying extra attention to Pakistan's nuclear program and not India's, analysts say. Fervently anti-US Islamic parties surged to power in October polls, winning control of one provincial parliament and almost one-fifth of the national parliament. Islamic militant groups continue to operate despite government efforts to stamp them out. They have executed 11 deadly attacks on Christian and Western targets in the past 18 months. bc/pch Pakistan-US-NKorea
