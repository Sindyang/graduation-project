China's Shanghai B-shares closed 0.27 percent higher Tuesday boosted by positive sentiment on the A-share market, dealers said. The Shanghai B-share index gained 0.33 points to 122.8 on turnover of 9.8 million dollars. The A-share index rose 12.65 points or 0.8 percent to 1,592.45 on turnover of 11.68 billion yuan (1.41 million dollars). Shanghai B-shares recovered from their morning losses to finish fractionally higher, tracking strong gains seen in A-shares, dealers said. "In the wake of the strength of key blue chips in the A-share market, Shanghai B-shares largely ignored the 2002 net loss reported by Shangdong Airlines", said Wang Jun, analyst from Hai Tong Securities. A-shares in Shanghai Tuesday were driven higher by the sustained strength of blue chips such as China Merchants Bank, analysts said. They added that investors believe blue chips will be favored by qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII) who are expected to enter China's domestic markets as early as the first half of this year. Some analysts said that Shandong Airlines dampened B-shares partly after the carrier announced it booked a net loss of 45.58 million yuan for 2002, compared with a net profit of 54.94 million yuan a year earlier. China Textile Machinery led B-share gainers, rising one cent or 1.73 percent to close at 58.9 US cents. Shanghai Matsuoka saw the largest decrease among B-shares, losing 2.1 cents or 1.92 percent to close at 107.4 US cents. The composite A- and B-share index closed 11.97 points up to 1,522.55. bur/dv Stocks-China
