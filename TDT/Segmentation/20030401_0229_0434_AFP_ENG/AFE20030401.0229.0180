Manchester United, the world's richest soccer club, have announced reduced profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the six months to the end of January. Higher media revenues and six more home Cup games lifted turnover in the six months to January 31 by 13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (146 million dollars) while operating profits before player sales rose 32 percent to 31.1 million pounds (49 million dollars). However, pre-tax profits were 34 percent lower because the club raked in less cash in transfer market. In the previous period, the club generated 16.3 million pounds from selling Jaap Stam to Italian club Lazio and Andy Cole to English side Blackburn. "We have significantly improved our operating performance," said chief executive Peter Kenyon. "The strength of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United. "Looking ahead, we have a clear strategy focusing on the development of media rights, the conversion of more fans to customers and the leveraging of our global brand." The club also have a debt-free balance sheet, which they said reflected strong operating cash flow and lower expenditure as a result of the completion of the Old Trafford stadium and academy facilities in the previous year. United's wage bill for the six-month period was 39.7 million pounds (63 million dollars) but at 43 percent of turnover this is still within the club's target of 50 percent. The second half of the financial year includes the close season and United said they expect the percentage to rise to 50 percent later in the year. Commercial turnover lifted 4 percent to 22.8 million pounds with United benefiting from a new partnership with Nike and eight new sponsorship deals. "The strength of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United plc," Kenyon said. He said the company's future strategy would concentrate on the development of media rights and the conversion of more fans into customers. "We're delighted with what we think are a strong set of financial results. Today our shareholders will be very happy that we have a business which sets ourselves apart from the rest of the industry." Recent share acquisitions from racehorse owners JP McManus and John Magnier, which made them the biggest single stakeholders in the club, increased speculation that the duo are planning a takeover at Old Trafford. But Kenyon dismissed the speculation. "There is no evidence of that (a takeover) and what we've seen are people joining our share register on the basis that we are an undervalued asset," he told BBC Radio. "This is not just a football club. It's consistently set itself apart from other clubs and this morning is no different. We can offer shareholders a solid return over a number of years. "Manchester United will always attract huge speculation but what we have to get back to is that it's a well run business capable of giving our shareholders a return." Last month, Kenyon said failure to land a trophy for the second successive season would be unacceptable. United are second to Arsenal in the English Premiership and play nine-times European Cup winners Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals this month. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-profits
