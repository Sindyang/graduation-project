European stocks rallied in early trading on Tuesday following sharp falls the previous day, bucking a downward trend on Wall Street overnight as traders set aside war worries briefly. The British FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 1.1 percent to 3,652.8 points, the German DAX 30 index increased 1.4 percent to 2,456.0 points and the French CAC 40 index was up 1.3 percent to 2,653.4 points. The DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index of leading euro-zone shares -- which had plunged 4.5 percent on Monday -- rebounded 1.5 percent to 2,129.6 points. The euro rose to 1.0911 dollars. The stock market turnaround came despite a slide in New York on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones industrials average of 30 top stocks drop 1.89 percent and the Nasdaq index decline just over two percent. Dealers there had taken fright at the prospect of a drawn-out, bloody war in Iraq, as well as a multi-billion dollar legal threat to tobacco giant Philip Morris USA, part of the Altria group. "It's a see-saw market," admitted Henk Potts, an analyst with Barclays Stockbrokers. "The market is trading very much on the headlines." Given the general market chaos over the Iraq war, It was difficult to pinpoint an exact reason for the bounce-back, he said, beyond individual trading decisions. "People are always interested in looking at the market in volatile times. There is interest in the market, in buying back some of the sold positions," he said. However Potts warned that the rally might not last. "We are still paying the price for the over-exuberant rally two weeks ago," he said. "I still think that the short-term outlook is on the down side." In Asia, the news had been mixed, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropping around 0.4 percent, while Japanese prices closed 0.18 percent higher on fresh demand associated with the country's new fiscal year. Among individual shares, tobacco firms were the big losers following concerns in the United States over the Philip Morris lawsuit. The firm has been ordered to post a 12-billion-dollar bond while it appeals against a March 22 court order to pay huge damages for misleading smokers about the dangers of light cigarettes over the past 30 years. Analysts have warned that the firm could have big problems raising so much money, and may even have to file for bankruptcy unless it can lower the bond. In London, tobacco firms were punished in the light of the decision. Gallagher slipped 2.3 percent to 596.2 pence, Imperial Tobacco fell 1.1 percent to 993.5 pence and British American Tobacco dipped 1.0 percent to 585.5 pence. pw/dr/hd Stocks-Europe
