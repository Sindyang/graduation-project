BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, a diplomatic source in the Belgian capital told AFP. Contacts were being made on Tuesday with a view to setting up the meeting, which has been requested by the US administration, the source said. Powell is set to discuss the US-led war on Iraq with Turkish leaders on Tuesday. He will then travel on to Brussels for talks with NATO and three senior European officials -- EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, European External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten and Greek Foreign Minister Georges Papandreou, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc. The US State Department has said Powell hopes to raise issues about the invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the post-war future of the oil-rich country. phv/gil/yad Iraq-war-US-EU-Powell
