An anti-aircraft shell fired from southern Lebanon landed near a school in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona on Tuesday, without exploding or causing any injuries, security officials said. The sources gave no more details on the sudden attack. On March 15, an anti-aircraft shell fired by Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas operating in southern Lebanon hit the main street in the northern town without exploding. Hezbollah said at the time its gunners had swung into action against "Israeli aircraft violating Lebanese air space close to the border". Hezbollah and Israeli forces dug in along the heavily defended border often engage in brief artillery duels, with Israeli fighter-bombers being used to swoop into Lebanese airspace. str-jlr/jh/dab Israel-Lebanon-Hezbollah
