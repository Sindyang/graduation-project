Israeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz on Tuesday threw down a warning to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad about the might of the Jewish state as tensions between the two neighbours rose. "President Bashar al-Assad knowns the might and the force of Israel in all areas, including the military," said Mofaz. Mofaz was reacting to remarks made by the Syrian leader to the Lebanese daily al-Safir last week that "as long as Israel exists, the threat (against) Israel will exist". "These remarks are all the more serious as they come at a time when it transpires that the Syrians are helping Iraq, as US leaders have revealed," said Mofaz. On Monday, a senior Israeli army intelligence officer charged that Iraqi missiles, possibly armed with chemical and biological warheads, may be hidden in Syria. General Yossi Kupperwasser's remarks came a day after US Secretary of State Colin Powell warned both Syria and Iran to stop what he called their backing for terrorists, saying Syria in particular faces a "critical choice." "Syria can continue direct support for terrorist groups and the dying regime of Saddam Hussein, or it can embark on a different and more hopeful course," Powell said. Last Friday US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned the two states to steer clear of the Iraq war, saying that military supplies allegedly crossing from Syria were a "hostile act". In December, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he had information indicating that Iraq had transferred weapons of mass destruction to Syria. The Israeli daily Haaretz said Tuesday that "in the last few days Damascus has expedited the passge of volunteers wishing to join the Iraqis in their war against the Americans". Despite the US warnings not to align itself with Iraq, a spokesman for the Syrian foreign ministry swore support for the Iraqi people against the invaders. "Syria has chosen to align itself with the brotherly Iraqi people who are facing an illegal and unjustified invasion and against whom are being committed all sorts of crimes against humanity," the spokesman said. Arab League Secretary General Amr Mussa on Monday voiced concern that the Iraq war could spill over and destabilise the entire Middle East. jlr/jh/kir Iraq-war-Israel-Syria
