South Korea issues state bonds to prop up falling money market rates ATTENTION - UPDATES with govt mulling market stabilization measures /// SEOUL, April 1 (AFP) - South Korea's central bank on Tuesday put four trillion won (3.2 billion dollars) worth of bonds on the auction block as part of efforts to shore up money market rates amid slackening economic activity. The central Bank of Korea is believed to have offered extra yields of somewhere between one and two basis points (0.01 to 0.02 percentage points) on top of market rates for the monetary stabilization bonds. "Our survey showed most of the bonds will be digested in the market at the level of the yields we expect to offer," a BoK official said. Three-year benchmark state bond yields on Monday closed down another 0.06 percentage points at 4.62 percent, and the three-year corporate bond yield was down 0.02 at 5.38 percent. Tuesday's issuance of monetary stabilization bonds underscored a new urgency for market stabilization measures as bad news continued to affect South Korea's economy. Stock prices continue to fall, consumer confidence tumbled to a 18-month low on Monday, consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in March, while economists say this year's economic growth will fall well below four percent, compared with last year's performance of 6.2 percent. The economists warned that even a quick end to the war in Iraq might not lead to an early rebound of the South Korean economy. They cited the mounting stand-off over North Korea's nuclear programme and looming labor confrontations as factors that could undermine investment. Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the government would convene a meeting of policy makers this week to address concerns over a liquidity crunch faced by credit card companies. Mounting debts owed by credit card companies, including bonds issued by them, which stood at 89 trillion won (7.1 billion dollars) as of December last year, have emerged as a main source of jitters in the financial markets. Byeon Yang-Ho, director of financial policy division at the Finance and Economy Ministry, said the government will convene the meeting as early as Wednesday to discuss measures aimed at easing concerns over credit card companies. "Of the debts owed by credit companies, there are little problem debts," Byeon said, adding the companies have run no risk of going insolvent. "We need to take some measures to assure the markets that these companies are viable, to enhance their profitability and ease the short-term liquidity crunch," he said. Most credit card firms reported losses this year due to a sharp rise in delinquencies and a cut in commissions. ckp/dv SKorea-economy-bonds
