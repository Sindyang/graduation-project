Nearly two-thirds of Britons think the US-British war against Iraq is going well, according to a poll published in The Times newspaper on Tuesday. The Populus poll, taken last weekend, showed that nearly two thirds of Britons think the war "will have been justified only if it produces proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and more than four in five say that the war will have succeeded only if (Iraqi) President Saddam Hussein is captured or killed," The Times said. Britons also said they were resigned to the war lasting several months. A US poll released Monday found that 70 percent favor the war on Iraq while 27 percent oppose it. The Gallup poll was conducted Saturday and Sunday for USA Today and CNN. In France, a poll published in Le Monde newspaper Monday said that just over half of the French public wants a victory for the US-British alliance. Fifty-three percent of respondents answered yes when asked if they wanted "deep-down a victory for the US and the English," against 33 percent who said they did not and 14 percent who gave no response, according to the IPSOS survey. Seventy-four percent felt that President Jacques Chirac had not "gone too far in his opposition to the US," against 23 percent who thought he had. bur/msa/yad Iraq-war-Britain-poll
