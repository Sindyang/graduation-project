Sol Campbell says England can afford no more slip-ups if they are to book an automatic place in the 2004 European Championships. The fit-again Arsenal defender believes Sven-Goran Eriksson's side must reproduce their World Cup form if they are to dispose of closest rivals Turkey in Sunderland on Wednesday. The Turks hold a two-point advantage in Group Seven courtesy of England's failure to defeat Macedonia last October. "We are really in a situation now where we have to keep on winning. In reality we have to win all our games from this point to qualify as of right. It's as simple as that," Campbell said. "We don't want to go into a play-off if at all possible." "We know that Turkey will represent a big test and we will have to produce the sort of stuff we did against Argentina in the World Cup, but playing such a great side will bring the best out of the players." Eriksson was expected to take a tactical gamble on Wednesday by reverting to the midfield diamnond formation last used in Slovakia in October. But Turkey coach Senol Gunes warned that if it failed he might soon be facing the sack. "A decision could be made about him," Gunes said when asked what he thought would happen if England failed to qualify for the Portugal finals. Eriksson's plan is to give Manchester United star Paul Scholes more freedom. And it has got the backing of Liverpool star striker Michael Owen. "It obviously helps to score goals if Paul Scholes is further up the field," he said. "The best way to create space in between their back line and midfield is to stretch them with someone who can get in behind them, and in situations like that Scholes comes into his own." bur/rw03 Fbl-Euro2004-ENG-Campbell
