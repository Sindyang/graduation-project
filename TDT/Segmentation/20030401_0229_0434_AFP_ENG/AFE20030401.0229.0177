Turkey does not know of any new demands by key ally the United States to help out in the war against Iraq, Turkey's foreign minister Abdullah Gul said Tuesday ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Colin Powell. "What we know right now is that Powell is visiting an ally country. There is nothing planned," Gul told the Anatolia news agency when queried on whether Powell would fly into Ankara with new requests. Several Turkish newspaper speculated on Tuesday that Powell may ask Ankara for the use of airbases in the war against Iraq during his visit. Turkey is currently allowing US warplanes to use its airpsace for raids against Iraq. Gul said that he believed Powell's visit would help "clear up certain doubts" in bilateral relations. Turkish-US ties have deteriorated since March 1 when the Turkish parliament voted against a US request to deploy 62,000 troops here to open a northern front against Baghdad that, according to military analysts, would have shortened the war and minimized casulaties. han/yad Iraq-war-US-Turkey-Powell
