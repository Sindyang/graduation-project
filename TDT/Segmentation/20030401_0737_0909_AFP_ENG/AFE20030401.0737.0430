British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday it was "increasingly probable" that Iraq was behind the attack on a civilian target in Baghdad last month. "It's increasingly probable that this was the result of Iraqi, not coalition action," Straw said in a speech to newspaper editors in London. He was apparently referring to an attack on March 26 in Baghdad in which 14 civilians were killed and around 30 wounded as two missiles fell in a working-class market district. British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon has said the attack may have been caused by the Iraqi military. "Although investigations continue into this tragic incident, it could clearly have been caused by fallout from the regime's anti-aircraft fire or the failure of one of the regime's own missiles," Hoon said. Baghdad has said allied fire was responsible. The United States acknowledged it might have killed some civilians with air strikes. A statement by the US Central Command said coalition warplanes used precision-guided weapons to attack nine Iraqi surface-to-surface missiles and launchers that were placed in a residential neighborhood of Baghdad. "Most of the missiles were positioned less than 300 feet (90 meters) from homes," said the statement. It made no direct mention of deaths in the text, but the headline read: "Civilian damage possible." msa/heg/yad Iraqi-war-Britain-bombing-Straw
