A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Tuesday indicted two Islamic militants over a suicide bombing that killed 11 Frenchmen last year in the southern port city of Karachi, court officials said. Both defendants Asif Zaheer and Mohammed Bashir pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, use of explosives and conspiracy to murder. Zaheer, from the Harkat Jihad-ul Islami militant group and Bashir, of the outlawed Kashmiri militant organisation Harkatul Mujahedin, were asked to stand up before Judge Feroze Mahmood Bhatti read out the charges. "You both are charged that, with connivance of your other companions,...you hatched the conspiracy which killed 11 French engineers and technicians and two other persons," Bhatti said. The charges are punishable by death. Prosecutors told the court that they had eyewitness statements and confessions by the defendants to submit as proof of their involvement in the gruesome May 8 attack which also killed two Pakistanis and the suicide bomber. "We have confessions of the accused as well as statements of eye witnesses who saw the accused at the time of the incident," public prosecutor Maula Bux Bhatti said. "Police recovered explosive material from the two accused at the time of their arrest and the same material was used in the suicide bomb attack which establishes our case," he added. Both Zaheer and Bashir earlier told interogators they mistakenly thought their targets were Americans, and regretted that the victims turned out to be French who had been working on the Pakistan navy's Agosta 90-B submarine. The court in February declared five other militants absconders and in March ordered seizure of the property. The prosecutor said police had identified two of the five absconders as Adnan Qamar Noni and Sohail, but they were unaware of their current whereabouts. The judge adjourned the case until April 3 when the court would listen to doctors who examined the victims' bodies and provided medical treatment to the injured. str/rj/bc/rcw Pakistan-attacks-France
