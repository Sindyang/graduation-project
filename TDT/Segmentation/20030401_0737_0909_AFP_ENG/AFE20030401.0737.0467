English Premiership side Arsenal have made a bid for Werder Bremen's Serb international defender Mladen Krstajic, it was reported here Tuesday. "I'd like to stay in Bremen but if the club doesn't want to retain me I'm happy to talk to others," said the 29-year-old who is under contract to 2004. No transfer fee was reported but Krstajic cost Bremen 1.25 million euro when they bought him from Partizan Belgrade in 2001 and were understood to have asked Arsenal for 7 million euros (4.8 million pounds). bfi/rw03 Fbl-GER-ENG-SEM-Arsenal
