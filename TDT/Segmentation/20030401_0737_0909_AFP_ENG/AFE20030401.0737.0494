Aston Villa have been told they will not face any charges from the Football Association following crowd problems during their derby against Birmingham last month. There were four pitch invasions and one home fan ran the length of the Villa Park pitch to confront Birmingham midfielder Robbie Savage. But Villa said Tuesday the FA had praised them for the way they handled the trouble and because of their previous good record would not be charged. Hoever, both Villa and Birmingham have been charged with failing to control their players. Villa striker Dion Dublin and Birmingham striker Christophe Dugarry have also been charged with misconduct. bur/rw03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-Villa
