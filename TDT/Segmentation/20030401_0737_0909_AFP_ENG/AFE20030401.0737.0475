Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said Tuesday he had extended his contract with the German club to 2005. Hitzfeld, 54, who has won the Champions League with both Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in the past six seasons, is believed to have had offers from several top sides - and has been touted in the past as a successor to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. But Hitzfeld, Bayern coach since 1998, wants another shot at the Champions League with Bayern who failed to survive the first phase this season. Bayern currently have a mammoth 15-point lead over nearest rivals Dortmund as they chase their 18th league title. bfi/rw03 Fbl-GER-Bayern
