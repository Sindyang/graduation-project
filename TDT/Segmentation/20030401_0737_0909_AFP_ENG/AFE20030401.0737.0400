Yoshiyuki Kamei became Japan's new farm minister Tuesday, replacing Tadamori Oshima who resigned a day earlier over a money scandal involving a former aide. Kamei, a former transport minister, immediately pledged cooperation with the European Union in liberalising farm trade, one day after the passing of a deadline for establishing a framework for talks on the issue. "By continuing to closely cooperate with the European Union and other parties, we will strive to seek a realistic and balanced agreement," he said at a press conference. Kamei, 66, is a seasoned member of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party and has been elected to the House of Representatives seven times since 1979. He served as transport minister in 1996 under then prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Kamei's predecessor, Oshima, took the post in a cabinet reshuffle last September but refused to leave the job after the scandal came to light. In February, Oshima admitted that a building owner from his constituency in Hachinohe city in northern Japan gave an aide six million yen (50,000 dollars) for election campaigning in June 2000. The aide frittered away the money without keeping records and hiding the matter from Oshima. He was later dismissed. sps/rcw Japan-politics-scandal-Kamei
