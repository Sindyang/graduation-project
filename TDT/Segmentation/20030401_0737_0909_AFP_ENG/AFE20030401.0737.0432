Singapore on Tuesday reported another three new cases of the killer respiratory virus including a sixth imported infection, raising the city-state's reported cases to 95. The latest Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) index case involved a 56-year-old Chinese national who arrived from China's Fujian province near Guangdong on March 16 to visit her daughter, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. "She became unwell on March 28 and was admitted to TTSH (Tan Tong Seng Hospital) as a suspect SARS case on March 29," the statement said. The woman was "diagnosed as a SARS case," it said, adding home quarantine orders are being issued. Four people in Singapore have died from SARS in Singapore out of the 95 cases reported so far. The city-state is among the worst hit in Asia and authorities have taken tough measures to contain the spread of the virus by closing schools up to the pre-universty level until April 6 and serving mandatory quarantine orders. Of the 95 cases, 13 of them are still in serious condition, the ministry said. There is no known cure for SARS which has now killed more than 60 people and infected over 1,900 globally. bh/rcw Health-pneumonia-Singapore
