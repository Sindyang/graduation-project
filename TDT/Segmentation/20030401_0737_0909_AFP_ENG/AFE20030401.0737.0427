Iraqi authorities have expelled an Australian journalist covering the war from Baghdad, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported in its Wednesday edition. Ian McPhedran, a reporter for the News Limited group of newspapers which includes the Daily Telegraph, was ordered to leave the Iraqi capital on Monday, the organization said. McPhedran told the newspaper Iraqi officials accused him of breaking regulations by travelling from his hotel to the information ministry building in Baghdad. His expulsion leaves Paul McGeough of the Sydney Morning Herald as the only Australian among the foreign correspondants still covering the war from Baghdad. dm/rcw Iraq-war-media-Australia
