Israel and the United States locked horns Tuesday over the implementation of a US-backed peace plan, with Washington reportedly saying it will publish the "roadmap" despite Israeli demands that further changes be made. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stressed after a meeting with US President George W. Bush that the Palestinians had to fight "terrorism" before any implementation of the peace plan. But Bush, facing a tougher than expected campaign in Iraq and with mounting tension in the Arab world, insisted he was "serious" about pushing ahead with the step-by-step plan to forge a Palestinian state, Israeli public radio said. "I said clearly there cannot be two parallel paths: the war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night," Shalom told the radio in Washington. "The end of terrorism constitutes the central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," he said. Shalom, who was making his first visit to Washington since being named foreign minister last month, met Bush late Monday when the US leader dropped in on talks he was holding with US national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney. He also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. The roadmap is a plan setting out the steps to Palestinian statehood by the year 2005. Based on a Bush speech on the Middle East last June, it was drafted by US, UN, EU and Russian diplomats, but Israel has raised a number of objections. Foremost among its complaints is the fear that the plan might progress from one phase to the next without really tackling the problem of powerful militant groups attacking Israel. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's advisor Dov Weisglass has said he would like a US mechanism to judge when the conditions have been met to move from phase to phase, sidelining the United Nations and European Union, with which Israel has cool relations. Israel has reportedly proposed 100 changes to the roadmap as drafted, and convinced the United States to delay its publication, despite European objections, until after its January 28 elections. It has since been further delayed as the moderate new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, forms his own cabinet, in a move meant to sideline veteran Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, seen by Israel and Washington as an obstacle to peace. But Israeli public radio quoted sources in Washington as saying that the US administration did not intend to make any changes to the roadmap and that it would be published "as it was". Palestinian officials have complained at the repeated delays in finalising the much-debated plan, unfavourably comparing the speed with which the United States and Britain went to war with Iraq and the apparent foot-dragging on the peace plan. Chief negotiator Saeb Erakat accused Israel of stalling the roadmap. "The statement by Shalom in the White House is an Israeli rejection of the roadmap," he told AFP. "Israel is working to thwart any efforts to try to bring the peace process back on track. Shalom is challenging the White House and creating the basis for a continuing rejection of the roadmap," he said. Meanwhile, Washington chided both Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) over human rights abuses, noting "problems" with Israel's treatment of Israeli Arabs while accusing the Palestinian administration of having a "poor" human rights record and continuing "to commit numerous, serious abuses." The State Department's annual rights report said members of the Palestinian security forces and Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) took part in anti-Israel violence and terrorist attacks. It said that while there was no proof of official approval of such acts, some endorsed the use of violence in principle in a violation of commitments to halt attacks on Israelis. "The PLO and PA have not complied with most of their commitments, notably those relating to the renunciation of violence and terrorism, taking responsibility for all PLO elements, and disciplining violators," it said. Israeli forces occupying almost the entire West Bank also destroyed the houses of two Palestinian militants, including the family home of an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber who injured some 30 people on Sunday in a seaside resort. Israel has demolished more than 200 homes belonging to militants to deter future suicide attacks, but critics have slammed the policy as collective punishment. bur-jh/mb Mideast
