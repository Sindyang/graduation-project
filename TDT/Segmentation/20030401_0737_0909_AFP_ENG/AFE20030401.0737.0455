Nearly 400 people fell ill, with 60 hospitalized, after they ate bacteria-laden ham at a restaurant in central China's Henan province, Chinese media said Tuesday. The outbreak is one of the biggest in China, which is notorious for its mass poisoning cases. It follows an incident in September when 42 people died out of around 300 poisoned by breakfast snacks laced with rat poison in the Tangshan township of eastern city Nanjing. A rival snackshop owner was later executed for the crime. The Henan ham victims started vomiting and feeling faint after eating at the restaurant in a village on the outskirts of the city of Nanyang on March 24. Most of the victims had eaten at banquets at the restaurant, whose menu included a ham dish. The first victims arrived at hospitals the following morning and by night, 390 patients had been treated for similar symptoms. Investigators later found the ham, which was made by a food processing factory in northern China's Shaanxi province, contained several hundred times the amount of bacteria allowed by national food safety standards. Police have launched an investigation. cs/th China-poison
