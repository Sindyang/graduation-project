Seven people who smuggled 43 Chinese into South Korea were sentenced Tuesday to jail terms ranging from three to 14 years, state media reported. Liu Jie, Wang Zhihong and five others attempted to smuggle 66 Chinese people into South Korea in March 2002, the Xinhua news agency said. Twenty-three of the people who were smuggled were captured by South Korean police. The human-smugglers made a total of one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) from the stowaways. The sentence was delivered by the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court. cs/th China-smuggling
