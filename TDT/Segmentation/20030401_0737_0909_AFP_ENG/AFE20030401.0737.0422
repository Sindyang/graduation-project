The British government admitted for the first time Iraqi civilians may see US-British forces as villains not liberators, only hours before reports early Tuesday that American troops had fired on a civilian vehicles killing seven women and children. "We know that for the moment we will be seen as the villains. We knew that from the reaction before the conflict started," Home Secretary David Blunkett told BBC television. He was speaking late Monday shortly before reports that US troops had shot dead seven women and children after firing on a civilian vehicle at a military checkpoint in central Iraq. The incident was thought likely to fuel vocal international opposition to the 13-day-old war and undermine US efforts to win support from the Iraqi people. But Britain's secretary of state for the armed forces Adam Ingram told Sky News the civilian shooting was "a tragedy that happened due to the heat of war." US media Tuesday also warned of the negative impact that incidents like the checkpoint shooting will have on public opinion in Iraq and the Middle East, with the New York Times saying it is just what the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants. Analysts have said US military planners erred in calculating that the Iraqi population would greet the invaders as liberators, with US and British troops instead facing dogged resistance. Blunkett, however, took the long view, saying once the war is over "and there is a free Iraq ... the population as a whole will say that we want a free country, we want a state to live in where we can use our talent to the full rather (than) as with the Iraqi regime they have been dependent, 60 percent dependent, on food for oil." "What we want from the region is an answer to the question not only whose side are you on ... but what sort of society in the future do you want to see," he said. "Do you want to see functioning states that allow their people to flourish, to produce, to provide scientific endeavour, to feed their own people, do you want states that are actually free enough to be able to speak their minds rather than seek asylum in our country?" "If that is what you want, if you want a free enterprising region where people can speak and act freely, then you are on our side not on theirs," Blunkett said. Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said Tuesday that it has become apparent "that obviously after two-and-a-half decades of (Iraqi President) Saddam (Hussein), fear has been a major factor in the response of the local population. "But where the local population in those areas we control have begun to see we are serious and are going to stay, the fear factor is receding day by day," he said. Officers in southern Iraq said Tuesday that British forces in the region were swapping their helmets for berets as markets and schools reopened in secure areas. They said the berets were a symbolic gesture to the local people. "You can see the guys' faces, so it indicates openness and friendliness," according to a British spokeswoman. British forces spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon admitted in a BBC Radio 4 Today program that incidents like the checkpoint shooting undermined efforts to win the support of the Iraqi people. "If you were a civilian watching that, of course you would interpret it in that way," he said. But he said junior officers had the "full backing" of their superiors to make snap decisions about a situation "whichever way it goes". "If the decision is made that the threat against our soldiers is sufficient, that they have to use self defence, then they will be fully supported. "They will be backed fully whichever way it goes," Vernon said. US officials have said the victims of the checkpoint shooting were in a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. msa/heg/yad/jkb Iraq-war-Britain-perception
