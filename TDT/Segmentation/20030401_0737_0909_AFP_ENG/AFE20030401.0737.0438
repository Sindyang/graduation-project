Swedes, who flock south en masse each winter in search of sunnier climes, were taken for a ride on Tuesday when a leading daily ran an April Fool's story saying that that their bracing capital Stockholm was to get a city-centre beach, complete with desert sand from the Gulf state of Dubai. The newspaper Dagens Nyheter said Stockholm city officials had asked construction group Skanska to transform a portion of the waterfront at the foot of the Royal Palace into a sandy beach in time for summer. The report sounded like music to the ears of sun-craving northerners who live in near-darkness for almost eight months of the year and dream of holidays consisting of white sand, beach totes and a roaring surf. Dagens Nyheter said the idea was based on the success of a similar project in Paris called "Paris Plage". However, contrary to the polluted waters of the Seine, beach-goers in the Swedish capital would be able to take a dip in the clean ,if rather frosty, waters of the Baltic Sea. It said the beach would most likely be called Playa Royal. "The beach will be 150 metres (500 feet) long, which corresponds to the length required by the European Union for a beach to be called Playa," it said, taking a swipe at EU bureaucracy. No expense would be spared in making Swedes' biggest wish come true, the paper said, noting that city officials had insisted that the sandy beach match the colour scheme of the Royal Palace. "We have searched the world over to find the right quality and colour, and now we think we have found it. We are soon going to sign a contract with a sand supplier from the Dubai desert," Skanska director Mats Williamson was quoted as saying. Skanska later issued a press release dashing the hopes of any Swedes who may have believed the story. liu/po/jh/ds Sweden-offbeat-AprilFool
