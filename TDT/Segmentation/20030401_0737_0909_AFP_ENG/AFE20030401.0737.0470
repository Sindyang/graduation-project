Russian oil giant LUKoil has had to delay the 1.375-billion-dollar (1.258-billion-euro) sale of its stake in a Caspian Sea oil field because of disagreements on how much tax it owes Azerbaijan's government on the deal, a LUKoil source told AFP Tuesday. LUKoil announced in December last year it was withdrawing from the consortium developing Azerbaijan's Azeri-Chiraq-Guneshli (ACG) offshore field and selling its 10 percent stake to the Tokyo-based company INPEX. But a LUKoil employee said negotiations over how much tax the Russian company should pay Azerbaijan were dragging on. The Azeri government must approve the sale before the deal can go through. "The Azeri government thinks LUKoil should pay 250 million dollars out of its profits from the sale," said the company employee, who was speaking on condition of anonymity. He said LUKoil Vice President Ravil Maganov was flying into Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Tuesday for talks with Azeri officials. "I think all this will be resolved by the end of April," he added. LUKoil, Russia's biggest oil company in terms of output, is understood to need the cash from the ACG sale to fund major capital investments in oil projects elsewhere in the world. Pending the sale, the ACG field consortium comprises BP, which is also the operator, Azeri state oil company SOCAR, Statoil, LUKoil, Exxonmobil, Unocal, TPAO, Itochu Devon and Delta Hess. sab-clo/zak/hd Azerbaijan-Russia-oil-tax-company-LUKoil
