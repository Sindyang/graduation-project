Deutsche Boerse, the company which operates the German stock exchange, said Tuesday a total 6.7 million transactions were executed on its electronic trading platform, Xetra, in March, 36.7 percent more than in February. The previous record was 6.6 million transactions in October 2002. The strong rise in the number of transactions was attributable to investor nervousness in face of the Iraq crisis. In addition, March had three more trading days than February, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Boerse said. The value of the transactions amounted to 266.8 billion euros (291 billion dollars) in March, compared with 223.3 billion euros in February and 324.6 billion euros in March 2002. The Frankfurt stock exchange accounts for 99 percent of all stock transactions in Germany, with the rest executed by smaller regional exchanges. The futures exchange, Eurex, in which Deutsche Boerse holds a 50-percent stake, also reported a record 106 million transactions in March, 69 percent more than in March 2002. The previous record of 86.6 million transactions was set in October 2002. spm/hd Germany-stocks-finance-services-company-DeutscheBoerse
