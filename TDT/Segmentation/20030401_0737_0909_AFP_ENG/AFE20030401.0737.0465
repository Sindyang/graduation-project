Dubai-owned Emirates airline announced Tuesday it will boost flights to destinations in the Gulf and Iran between now and July despite the conflict in Iraq. "We are boosting our Middle East routes as part of the expansion taking place this summer across the whole network. We will not be deflected from our planned growth by the conflict in Iraq," said Emirates' head of commercial operations Ghaith al-Ghaith. Services to Qatar will be increased to four daily by July, while extra flights to Kuwait and the eastern Saudi town of Dammam were introduced on March 30. Tehran will be served with four additional flights, subject to government approval, from May 3, and services to Muscat in neighbouring Oman will rise to a twice daily service with the introduction of seven more flights. Flights to the Yemeni capital Sanaa, meanwhile, will increase to five week with the introduction of two extra weekly services. lp/bp/hc UAE-air-Gulf
