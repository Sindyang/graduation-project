Everybody who works with Ali Kadi aboard this US Navy aircraft carrier knows he is a Muslim but none of them seem to care. "I don't think borders exist, as far as this guy's Muslim, this guy's Catholic," Kadi, 38, told AFP. Born the son of Yemeni immigrants in the industrial town of Youngstown, Ohio, Kadi says he has been a practising Muslim all his life, including his almost 20 years spent in the US Navy. Kadi is a chief petty officer who supervises about 30 other sailors who control the flow of spare parts for the carrier's warplanes. He says he is one of about 10 followers of Islam among the Kitty Hawk's multicultural crew of more than 5,000. Kitty Hawk's attack fighters are bombing Iraq as part of the US-led war which has drawn strong criticism from Muslims around the world. In Bahrain, where the US Fifth Fleet is based, for example, people have demonstrated against what they see as US interference in their region to conduct a war of aggression against Islam. Many in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, are generally suspicious of US policy in the Middle East. They see it as being unfair to Muslims and Palestinians in particular. Kadi does not see things that way, saying people in those countries "need to taste" freedom and democracy. "Then they'll have different views of the United States and its policies," he said in his cramped office that resembles an automotive parts depot, with components wrapped in plastic and new tires lined up on the floor. "I believe it is the goal of the United States to make the Middle East more democratic, more free than it is right now," he said, echoing arguments used by the administration of US President George W. Bush. "I don't think religion has anything to do with it," Kadi said. Religion does not have much to do with navy work either. "I really don't look at somebody as Catholic or Christian. I look at a sailor as blue," Kadi said, referring to the colour of their uniforms. "It works," he said. "Everybody gets things done as a team." His father worked in Youngstown steel mills for three decades and also ran a variety store. "It was called Sammy's Quick Stop. It was on the corner, not that far from my house," he said. Asked whether he ever faced discrimination as he grew up, he said, "Anywhere you go, to say there's no discrimination whatsoever, zero, would be a lie." After living in Yemen for about six years as a teenager he returned to the US and faced a choice afer high school: join the family business or enlist in the navy. Kadi said he joined the military partly to see the world but also "to do my duty" and to show "that even Muslims are patriotic." After serving elsewhere Kadi joined the Kitty Hawk in May two years ago in time for the ship's support of operations in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks by Islamic terrorists who killed thousands in New York and Washington. Even then, Kadi said he never heard abusive comments about Muslims. "The only derogatory things I heard was from the media," he said. Tacked to the wall above his desk is a photo of his daughter, Sophia, five, wearing a Japanese kimono. The Kitty Hawk is based in Yokosuka, Japan, where Kadi has lived intermittently for seven years between stints in the US and Guam. His wife is Japanese. They are thinking about living in Egypt and then Malaysia when he retires from the navy. "I just want to experience other cultures. We want to travel. We're like Bedouins," he said. But for now there is a war to support, and Kadi says he is backing it all the way just like his fellow sailors, many of whom were raised in other countries. "Our backgrounds, even though they're varied, deep down inside we support whatever the president says," Kadi said. Before the war, he would join a couple of fellow Muslims for prayers on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, in the ship's chapel which serves all faiths. Now his 15-hour workdays make that Friday appointment and even daily prayer obligations harder to keep. "You can always make up for it later on," Kadi said. "Sometimes I'll just pray in my heart." it/hc/tm Iraq-US-navy-Muslim
