Never mind the bombings, here's the veggies -- Iraq's drivers deliver by Sammy Ketz = (PICTURES) = BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - There are duststorms and checkpoints and a steady rain of bombs, but Sadjaj Murteij promises the fresh fruit and vegetables will keep coming to Baghdad. "It's our job to feed the capital," he says, as a crowd of his fellow lorry drivers nod in agreement. Every day, hundreds of drivers like Murteij brave the hazards of war and set out from Iraq's key agricultural areas in the south to deliver the goods to the city's five million residents. The potatoes come from Nasafiyah, the garlic from Kut, the green beans from Yusafiyah -- and the potential for trouble from just about everywhere. "Of course we're afraid of the missiles," says Mehdi Adi, after finishing another hair-raising eight-hour run from the Al-Zubayr region 600 kilometres (375 miles) to the south, where Iraq and US-led forces have been engaged in ferocious battles. "A week ago, a group of eight cars was wiped out," he says, as workers at the Rashid Market in south Baghdad's Dora district process his payload for today -- 10 tonnes of tomatoes. "Even if it falls on the side of the road, the fragments can slash your tyres when you're rolling at full speed," he says. For Adi and his colleagues, time is of the essence. Vegetable traders at the Rashid, and the fruit traders at the Jamila Souk just opposite, close at 2 pm every day. Those who don't get their business done in time stay overnight in Baghdad, which gets heavily bombed after dark. Meanwhile the long road across the Iraqi desert is full of surprises. Murteij says that what happens at the US army checkpoints which have sprung up here and there depends on how stressed out the soldiers are feeling. "Sometimes they just wave us through but when they're tense, they make us get out, search us and then use a metal detector to make sure we're not carrying any weapons," Murteij says. Hussein Ali, 23, says the US troops use Kuwaiti translators just in case. But when he was recently stopped near Nasariyah -- site of some of the most intense fighting of the war so far -- sign language was all it took. "The soldier was pointing at my haul, and then circling his finger to ask what it was. So I stuck a tomato out of my window," he says. Adel Amin Hussein, one of the 54 traders at the Rashid, says that since the war began, business is down and prices are up. "The Rashid was moving 600 to 700 tonnes of tomatoes before the war, and now it's 400 to 450. Prices have gone up from an average of 275 dinars (nine cents) per kilo to 400 dinars (13 cents)," he says. The rise is largely due to the fact that the drivers have increased their prices five-fold, from 100,000 to 500,000 dinars (33 to 155 dollars) a trip. Another trader, Daoud Suleiman, says the price of potatoes has meanwhile gone down a third after initially rising after the war began March 20. "There are too many on the market," he says. That's something Sadjaj Murteij would probably be proud to hear. "I can guarantee you one thing, Baghdad will never die of hunger. We're adventurers," Murteij says. "Sandstorms, war, bombing -- we deliver." sk/mc/bp/hc Iraq-war-food
