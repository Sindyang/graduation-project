The provisional results of a parliamentary election in the small west African state of Benin will be released by Wednesday, the chairman of the national electoral commission, Ibrahima Adam Soule, has announced. People in Benin went to the polls on Sunday to elect a new national assembly, where President Mathieu Kerekou's supporters have said they were keen to win an uncontested and "clear majority". "The centralisation (of ballot results) is already complete," Soule told AFP on Tuesday. "In any event the results will be released tomorrow at the latest. That's the final date." "Some trends will be made public on Tuesday evening," he added. A national polling institute on Monday released estimates indicating that opponents of Kerekou had won a large majority in the two main towns, Cotonou, the seat of government, and the capital Porto Novo, both in the south. Kerekou, a former military ruler who stepped down after the country's first multi-party elections in 1991 but was re-elected a decade later, has traditionally seen most of his support in the north of the country. Around 3.1 million people were registered to vote to pick the 83 members of the new national assembly from 1,162 candidates from 14 parties and political alliances, but apathy reportedly prevailed and voter turnout was low. The outgoing parliament is divided, with the ruling coalition holding 41 seats against 38 for the opposition. Both groups are in a heated race to garner a clear majority in the one-chamber assembly. Kerekou on Sunday urged the electorate to turn up in hordes. "I am appealing to all my compatriots who hold voters' cards to come out massively to choose their candidate," he said after casting his ballot in Cotonou. "In principle, nobody should abstain from voting. It is a duty for everyone to come out once in four or five years to vote." But an AFP correspondent at one Cotonou polling station reported that four hours after voting began, only 20 of the 408 registered voters there had cast their ballots. A local election official said: "This situation does not suprise me. "The Beninese are not used to this tempo to vote three times in about three months," he said, referring to local and municipal elections staged in December and January. "What is important is peace and discipline and these were observed during polling." Some voters gave other reasons. "Some people wanted to vote but they lost their voters' cards. I know many such cases in my area," a man said. Among the political groups fielding candidates were the ruling coalition, the Union for the Benin of the Future (UBF); the main opposition Renaissance of Benin (RB) led by former president Nicephore Soglo; and the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) headed by Adrien Houngbedji, the mayor of Benin's capital Porto Novo. Soglo, a former World Bank official, won Benin's first multi-party polls in 1991 and served as president until 1996, when he lost elections to Kerekou. ek-eg/nb/kdz Benin-vote
