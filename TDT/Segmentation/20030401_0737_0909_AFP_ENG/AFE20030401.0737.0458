Two of Japan's debt-ridden second-tier trading houses, Nissho Iwai and Nichimen, merged their operations Tuesday under a holding company with financial support from US investor Lehman Brothers. The holding company, Nissho Iwai-Nichimen Holdings Corp., vowed to accelerate restructuring efforts with its annual group pre-tax profit targeted at 101 billion yen (856 million dollars) in three years' time. "Our biggest mission is to achieve the numerical targets, which we have shown at home and abroad, as scheduled," Toru Hambayashi, who quit as Nichimen president to become the holding company's chairman, said in a statement. The holding company will also aim for a group net profit of 70 billion yen for the year to March 2006, compared with a combined net loss of 111 billion yen estimated for the year which ended on Monday. Five Japanese financial institutions and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. were in final negotiations to invest more than 260 billion yen in Nissho Iwai-Nichimen Holdings Corp. possibly in May, a business daily said on Monday. UFJ Bank, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc., Resona Bank and Norinchukin Bank will acquire preferred shares to be issued by the holding company, the daily said. Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers plans to acquire five billion yen in preferred shares, in addition to the 10 billion yen in convertible bonds it will buy in the year to March 2004, the report said. This would mark the first time a foreign investor had participated in the restructuring of a Japanese trading house. sps/th Japan-trading-company
