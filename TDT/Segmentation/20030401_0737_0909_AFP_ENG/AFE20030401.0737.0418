The appeals court in Ndjamena on Tuesday freed two Chadian journalists who were jailed in February for libelling a top civil servant. The managing editor of the independent weekly Notre Temps, Nadji Kimo, and a senior staffer on the paper, Mbainaye Betoubam, were freed conditionally, pending the hearing of their case on April 22. The two had been sentenced in early February to six months in prison and had their newspaper shut down for three months, after an article in Notre Temps accused the director of social affairs in the ministry of social action and women, Billy Douga, of avenging the theft of some jewellery by torturing the alleged thieves. One of the suspects allegedly died of his wounds. Police, who arrested three people in connection with the theft, said that the man allegedly tortured to death had died in Ndjamena of an incurable disease, without ever having been detained. The arrest of the two newsmen sparked a protest from the Central African Media Organisation (OMAC) and the Union of Press Editors of Central Africa (UEPAC), which said it was "a serious blow to press freedom". "UEPAC and OMAC denounce and condemn with their utmost vigour this verdict from another age," the two organisations said then in a joint statement released to AFP. The suspension of Notre Temps was a "serious setback to the economic survival of the company and a noteworthy step backwards in the democratic process in Chad," added the statement. aak/mcl/kdz/nb Chad-media-justice
