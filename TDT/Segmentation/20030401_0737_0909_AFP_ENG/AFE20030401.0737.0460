A man with two hand grenades held an airliner with 46 people on board hostage at Havana's international airport and demanded that he be flown to Miami, officials said early Tuesday. The Soviet-made AN-24 airliner had been en route from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker ordered the crew to head for Miami but they had to land at Jose Marti International Airport because the planehad insufficient fuel. It was refuelled at around 7:00 am (1100 GMT) The airliner remained parked on the tarmac, surrounded by police, as authorities "do their utmost to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives of the passengers," the officials added. The hijacker aboard the plane threaten to detonate both his hand grenades if his demand to be flown to Miami is not met, they said. "The individual is at the back of the plane, apparently with two hand grenades, and he could possibly have some accomplices" on board, the statement added. All flights in and out of the airport have been canceled and inconvenienced passengers have been put up at hotels in Havana. The plane was hijacked Monday at around 9:30 pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking off from Nueva Gerona, on the Island of Youth some 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of the capital, the statement said. The airplane is carrying 40 adults, including the crew, and six children, the official statement said. "This act (of piracy) is the direct result of the encouragement US authorities have given hijackers with their incomprehensible behavior in the wake of the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner to the United States by six terrorists armed with knives," the Cuban official statement said. "The responsibility for what will happen (with Monday's hijacking) will fall entirely on the government" of the United States, the statement added. The Cuban statement referred to the March 19 hijacking to Florida of another Cuban airliner with 33 people on board after it also flew out of the Island of Youth. That plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, Florida's southernmost island, where the hijackers were taken into custody. Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum in the United States; the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later ruled that the six hijackers could be released on a 25,000 dollar bond pending trial, but the decision is being appealed. Cuban President Fidel Castro criticized the judge's decision and asked if the United States planned to put the six hijackers in a "gilded cage," wondering how their treatment would compare with the spartan conditions meted out to al-Qaeda and Taliban members confined at the US base in Guantanamo, Cuba. Cuba has also been critical of the US policy of granting asylum to any Cuban who manages to set foot on US soil -- like the 11 passengers on the March 19 flight. Those intercepted on the high seas are returned to the communist island. fgf/jlp/mac Cuba-plane
