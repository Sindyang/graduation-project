The Nepalese government's failure to announce an official negotiating team for peace talks with the Maoists has delayed a preliminary goodwill meeting, rebel sources said Tuesday. "The government has not yet constituted the negotiating team to hold the peace dialogue even two months after the declaration of a ceasefire," a highly placed Maoist source said. The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire on January 29, but a date for talks to end seven years of insurgency has not yet been set. Government negotiator Naryan Singh Pun had said last week a goodwill meeting could take place Tuesday. But Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand said Monday only that the talks would start soon. "I want to assure the peace dialogue will start soon with the objective of restoring peace and order in the country," he said. In March both sides signed a code of conduct for the talks, says both sides are committed to finding a peaceful solution through dialogue, will stop violent activities including strikes and kidnappings, gradually release prisoners and not obstruct the transport of food and medicine. "The government has not strictly followed the code of conduct agreement nor has it been serious about the holding of peace dialogue for over two months," the Maoist source said. The rebels have been fighting for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has claimed over 7,800 lives. kms/an/rcw Nepal-Maoist
