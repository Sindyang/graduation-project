Germany warned the public Tuesday against travelling to Algeria's Sahara desert after several Europeans, including up to a dozen Germans, were reported missing there. Diplomats said on Tuesday that six Germans, four men and two women, who were touring the southern Algerian desert in three four-wheel-drive vehicles had disappeared. Their relatives said they were "very worried" about the group and had not had any word from them since a phone call on March 17, the diplomats said. The disappearances bring to 17 the number of tourists reported to have gone missing without a trace in the north African country since late February. On February 21, 11 European tourists -- six Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- went missing in southern Algeria. bb-loc/jkb Algeria-tourism-Germany
