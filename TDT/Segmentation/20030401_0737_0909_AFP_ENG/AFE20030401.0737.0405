A man suspected of setting off bombs at two prestigious Beijing universities, injuring nine people, has been formally charged and is being tried in court, state media said Tuesday. Huang Minxiang, a 27-year-old who was arrested last month, was tried in the Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court Tuesday, the Xinhua news agency said. The report said Huang confessed to setting off the two explosions, which struck the Beijing University and Tsinghua University campuses within 90 minutes of each other on February 25. The blasts happened days before the start of the National People's Congress session which endorsed China's most profound leadership changes in a decade. Prosecutors alleged in court that Huang came up to Beijing by train on February 21 with the intent of carrying out the explosions. He brought with him gunpowder and other devices and went to the campuses to choose a location to place the bombs. He made the bombs, with timers, at his room at a Beijing hostel and from 11am to 1pm on February 25, placed the explosive devices at Tsinghua University's Heyuan cantine and Peking University's Nongyuan cantine and set off the bombs, the report said. None of the nine injured were seriously hurt. The blasts causes damages of 220,000 yuan (26,500 US dollars) to the cantines. Huang fled, but was later captured in Fuzhou, capital of the southeastern province of Fujian, where he lived. Students at the time said they believed the blasts were carried out by someone with a grudge against the government, not the students or faculty. The first branch of the Beijing People's Procuratorate charged Huang with premeditated bombing "to create influence." Xinhua had previously said Huang told police he carried out the attacks to "achieve fame." The exact reasons why Huang carried out the blasts was not revealed. Chinese authorities have a habit of making no reference to crime suspects' gripes against the government. The court will set a later date for announcing the verdict and sentence. Huang worked at the Hongshan Hongfeng Agricultural Development Company in Haikou city in south China's Hainan province, Xinhua said. cs/rcw China-blast-trial
