Singapore on Tuesday reported a fresh imported case of the killer respiratory virus and announced the closure of a polytechnic school after a student was suspected to have contracted the disease. The latest Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) index case involved a 56-year-old Chinese national who arrived from China's Fujian province near Guangdong on March 16 to visit her daughter, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said. "She became unwell on March 28 and was admitted to TTSH (Tan Tock Seng Hospital) as a suspect SARS case on March 29," the MOH said in a statement. The woman was "diagnosed as a SARS case," it said, adding home quarantine orders are being issued. The 20 year-old male student is the son of a 43-year-old Singaporean woman who died at the National University Hospital (NUH) on Monday from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the mysterious virus that has claimed more than 60 lives and infected over 1,900 people globally. He had developed fever on March 27 and was admitted into the Communicable Disease Centre on March 30, the MOH said. "As he is the son of the patient who died of SARS at NUH on March 31, he was diagnosed as a suspect SARS case," it said. Education Minister Teo Chee Hean said at a press conference that Ngee Ann Polytechic, where the student is studying, would be closed for the rest of the week as a "precautionary measure." The closure involving 13,000 to 14,000 students will "give us time to assess the situation and to contact tracing," he said. Four people in Singapore have died from SARS in Singapore out of more than 90 cases reported so far. The city-state is among the worst hit in Asia and authorities have taken tough measures to contain the spread of the virus by closing schools up to the pre-universty level until April 6 and serving mandatory quarantine orders. Since last week, 977 people in the city-state have been served quarantine orders. Of the 95 cases reported, 13 of them are still in serious condition, the ministry said. mba-bh/rcw Health-pneumonia-Singapore
