The volume of orders placed with companies in Germany's manufacturing sector rose by 4.1 percent in January from the figure for December, final data published by the Bundesbank on Tuesday showed. Manufacturing orders therefore showed a stronger increase than the 3.8 percent originally estimated on March 21 by the Economy and Labour Ministry in Berlin. The sharp increase in January orders therefore offsets the 4.0-percent slump in activity recorded in December from the previous month. Last week the Bundesbank revised sharply upwards German industrial output data for January. spm/vs Germany-economy-manufacturing-orders
