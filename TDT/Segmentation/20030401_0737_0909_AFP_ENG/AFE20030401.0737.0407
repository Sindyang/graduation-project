The Dutch airline KLM announced on Tuesday that it expects to cut thousands of jobs because of the adverse effects on air transport of the War in Iraq and the spreading of the SARS virus. "Based on an interim inventory of longer-term initiatives, KLM expects to cut several thousand jobs," the statement said. According to a KLM spokesman the company was already planning to restructure. "Due to the war in Iraq and the outbreak of the SARS epidemic we are forced to speed up our restructuring plans", he told AFP. KLM announced a general recruitment stop effective immediately, contracts of temporary workers will not be renewed and the hiring of external personnel will be almost completely suspended. In spite of these measures KLM warns that forced lay-offs will also be required. "Part of the job cuts will be effective before March 31, 2004," the spokesman said. sb/hd Netherlands-air-company-jobs-KLM
