Alain Robert, a 40 year-old Frenchman who has made his name by climbing up the outside of the world's biggest skyscrapers, scaled an office tower in Paris Tuesday to protest against the Iraq war. "I have no time for Saddam Hussein who has killed many civilians, but when when it comes to Iraq I can see right from wrong," he said before his ascent of the 180-metre (600 foot) Elf tower in the Defense business district in the west of the capital. "We're dealing with a nutcase who thinks he speaks on behalf of the universe. He's an outlaw. It's easy to act like that when you are the most powerful nation in the world," he said of President George W. Bush. Robert has climbed around 50 buildings around the world since 1994. pb-hs/jfs Iraq-war-France-protest
