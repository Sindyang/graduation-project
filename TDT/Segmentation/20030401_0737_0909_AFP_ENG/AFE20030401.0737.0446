Fearful of possible terrorist attacks or other repurcussions from the war in Iraq and unrest in the Middle East, tourists are looking increasingly to Latin America for a safe holiday destination. Faced with such uncertainty, Europeans and Americans "who were thinking of travelling to north Africa or the Middle East have changed their reservations and are becoming interested in Latin America," said World Tourism Organisation spokesman Rok Klancnik. Additionally, "the currencies of the different (Latin American) countries are weak and they are linked to the dollar, which in turn continues to fall against the euro," said Hugo Gonzalez, director of Latin American Travel Agents Committee. In Argentina, these factors have meant growth of 39.5 percent in the tourism sector during January and February, compared to the same period last year, according to the country's tourism secretariat. In March, the number of tourists visiting Cuba was up 20 percent up on the same period last year, according to the Caribbean News Digital website. The Dominican Republic experienced similar growth, with 149,808 people visiting the country by air in the first two weeks of March, compared with 125,743 the year before. "I have been in contact with all the operators and everything is going very well," said Dominican Tourism Minister Rafael Subervi. After two years of losses, tourism in Chile has also increased during summer in the southern hemisphere, according to the country's national tourism service Sernatur which registered growth of 2.7 percent. Sernatur director Oscar Santelices believes the war in Iraq represents an opportunity for local businesses, a sentiment echoed by Roque Sevilla, head of the chamber of tourism in Pichincha province, Ecuador. German and French tourists who had previously planned holidays in the United States have changed their plans after the bad feeling generated over their governments' opposition to war in Iraq, Sevilla noted. "They want a new destination, and that destination is Ecuador," he said. But not all Latin American tourism professionals are so optimistic. Jean Holder, head of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, told the Financial Times that war in Iraq could have an adverse effect on tourism in the region. The US-led invasion was a new blow to an industry which was just beginning to recover from the severe blow dealt it by the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, he said. Travellers who might normally choose to holiday in the Middle East would not switch to the Caribbean as they did in 1991 Gulf War, because the current conflict with Iraq was perceived to have far greater international ramifications. Mexican Tourism Minister Leticia Navarro meantime felt that the effect of the war on tourism would depend on the duration of the conflict. According to the newspaper Reforma, the flow of tourists to Mexico -- which is predominantly from the United States -- dropped by 17 percent in the first two days of the war. ml/jsl/ch Iraq-war-LatAm-tourism
