Thousands of Austrian school children have thrown themselves into a project to chronicle the fate of 80,000 Holocaust victims after their parents and grandparents for decades chose to ignore a tragic chapter in Austria's history. The Nazis killed some 65,000 Jews, as well as 15,000 gypsies, handicapped people, homosexuals and political opponents in the seven years they ran the country following its annexation in 1938. "Students Write History" was a project launched by two journalists, who say they are surprised by its success. Andreas Kuba, 37, used to write extensively about the country's political far right but says he stopped when he realised that he was in fact helping them to disseminate their views. His partner, the year younger Josef Neymayr, says in a country that long tried to forget its collaboration with Adolf Hitler, the project "is a way to assume responsibility for our past." "We got the idea when we saw the list of the names of the 65,000 Jews who were killed by the Nazis. The figure itself shocked us, but there was something missing -- the human element." Since the project began in January with support by the education ministry, it has simply snowballed. "There are 492 institutions working with us, 11 new schools signed up in just four days. The ministry expected about a third" of that, Neumayr said. Austrian state schools only started teaching the history of Nazism and the Third Reich in the late 1980s and in their enthusiasm the students almost seem to be making up for lost time. "What we are particularly pleased about, is the impact the project has had on Austrian society as a whole," Neumayr told AFP. "Many descendants of those who were deported have contacted us and asked to be put in touch with the youth working on the project," he said, adding that the project was helping to bring the generations together. Sometimes the students search the project's website for a particular individual whom their grandparents remember by date of birth, former home address or place and date of deportation. They also draw on files of Holocaust victims created by the Documentation Center on Austrian Resistance, as well as municipal archives and back issues of newspapers from World War II. History or religion teachers are monitoring their progress, while six historians are working on the project full time. For the past three weeks, 32 pupils at a Vienna school have have been mapping the lives of 16 victims of anti-Semitism and the Nazis' genetic engineering experiments. Lena Opitz, 16, has chosen to write the story of a Jewish woman by the same first name, while her classmate. 16-year-old Sabine Hofbauer tackled that of a presumed distant relative who was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. "You do not just learn the dates and the facts, like in an ordinary class, you start to understand what it all meant," 15-year-old Elisabeth Hafner said. "My mother and aunt are very interested in this because they have always wanted to learn more about this period," she added. So far, the students are working on more than 2,100 biographies. "Of course our aim is to do all 80,000 but it is not really the number that matters," Neumayr said. The project was initially due to finish at the end of 2003 but he said it would "surely carry over into next year" given the enthusiasm of the students and the sponsors. There were originally 10 sponsors but three news companies have recently joined in. For all their fervour, participants sometimes run into roadblocks. Students have had to give up looking for information about certain Holocaust victims because it is too hard to obtain and concentrate on others, said Walpurge Marhold, the headmaster at the Vienna school. "The students are disappointed. They thought they would quickly find information and photographs, but it is not that easy," said Stephan Roth, a historian working on the project. sj/ef/tm Austria-Nazis
