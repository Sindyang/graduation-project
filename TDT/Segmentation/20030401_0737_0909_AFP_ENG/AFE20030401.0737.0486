Welsh Rugby Union struck a deal with the clubs Tuesday in a move that national coach Steve Hansen has called vital if the country is to improve its disastrous Test record. WRU chief David Moffett met the clubs on Tuesday to thrash out a deal to change from a nine-club to five-club structure next season. The deal allows Welsh clubs to play in next season's European Cup competitions. The clubs had been holding out for an extra 500,000 pounds after being offered 7,500,000 pounds. No financial details were announced. Cash-strapped Swansea have already gone into temporary administration this season, and other clubs would have followed if there was no move towards regional rugby. Moffett had said that if the domestic top-flight remained at nine clubs next season, then there would only have been 4.62 million pounds to share. The clubs had threatened not to release their international players for the June tour to Australia and New Zealand if an agreement could not be found. Hansen said after Wales suffered a Six Nations Championship whitewash at Paris on Saturday a weak club competition undermined efforts to improve on the Test level. "We have a weak club competition that doesn't make for a winning culture," he said. bur/rw03 Rugbyu-WAL
