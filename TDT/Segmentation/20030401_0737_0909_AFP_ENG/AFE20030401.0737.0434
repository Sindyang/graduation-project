After marathon struggle, warring DR Congo sides agree on peace govt by Jean-Jacques Cornish = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details /// SUN CITY, South Africa, April 1 (AFP) - All sides in talks aimed at restoring peace in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Tuesday wrapped up 29 months of intense negotiations, agreeing to shape a government to lead to the first democratic elections in the former Zaire in 40 years. The approximately 360 delegates attending the final session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (ICD), which began 14 months ago, went into the talks' final plenary session on Tuesday morning. Within ten minutes they had adopted agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year, that provide for a two-year transition government to take the DRC through to democratic elections -- the first since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. They also adopted a constitution, which was agreed on March 6. "You are making history," the chairman of the talks, Sir Ketumile Masire, told delegates at the luxury South African casino resort of Sun City, some 150 kilometres (90 miles) northwest of Pretoria. "I would like to thank and congratulate you for the work you have done in South Africa," the former Botswanan president told the ICD, which he has chaired since the talks first moved to South Africa in February 2002. The resolutions agreed Tuesday will, together with 34 other resolutions adopted during the previous session of the ICD at Sun City last year, constitute the so-called Final Act in the DRC peace process, to be signed on Wednesday in the presence some 10 African leaders. South African President Thabo Mbeki has invited no fewer than nine African heads of state to witness the proceedings. It remained unclear whether President Joseph Kabila, who has insisted that the climax of the peace process take place in Kinshasa, will attend Wednesday's signing ceremony. His ambassador to South Africa, Bene M'Poko told AFP: "He doesn't need to come. We will have our celebrations back home." Sources close to the mediation insisted however that Kabila was being urged to make an appearance on Wednesday. "It would be a serious miscalculation for him not to come," said a source who asked not to be named. "The delegates are saying: 'We have made him our president and he will not even see the process through'. It would be a disaster if he does not arrive." Senegalese politician Moustapha Niasse, who was appointed as the UN special envoy to the DRC talks after the dialogue appeared to founder last year, told AFP he was not at all surprised at the speed and smoothness of Tuesday's proceedings. "We did our job," said Niasse, who presided over the December and March agreements in Pretoria with South African Provincial Affairs Minister Sydney Mufamadi. "After they had all signed those agreements, they could not contest anything contained in them. "All that remains now is a matter that cannot be resolved by the mediation," said Niasse referring to the military agreement struck in Pretoria last week but which so far had been signed only by the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD). Added Niasse: "The Congolese have to start doing something for themselves. The main problem in that (military) agreement is deciding who should become head of the army, which comprises 98 percent of the military." The five other belligerents have contested the attribution of the post of army chief to the RCD, which already has the ministry of defence in the transitional government. "The Congolese must talk on their own and solve this problem themselves," said Niasse. "The mediation cannot deal with it." Preparing for Wednesday's closing ceremony, delegates from the unarmed opposition and civil society still have to decide on their candidates for the vice presidency and the follow-up committee that will run the DRC until the transitional government comes into force, between two weeks and two months from Thursday. War broke out in DRC in 1998, and has since then killed some 2.5 million people, either directly through the fighting or indirectly through famine and illness, according to United Nations estimates str/jhe/hn/kdz DRCongo-talks
