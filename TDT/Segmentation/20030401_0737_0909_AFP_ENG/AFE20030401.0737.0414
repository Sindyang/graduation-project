Polish Health Minister Marek Balicki resigned Tuesday in a further blow to the leftist government of Prime Minister Leszek Miller. The resignation, announced officially by the government press service, came on the same day that a program reforming the central European country's health care services took effect. Public radio said Balicki had resigned to protest Miller's nomination of a former deputy health minister Aleksander Nauman to head a central agency that will manage a health fund. Balicki has opposed Nauman's nomination. Miller accepted the resignation and asked Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski to nominate Ewa Kralkowska of the socialist Democratic Labour Union, a coalition member, to replace Balicki. Balicki's resignation further adds to the woes of Miller's government, which has been in a minority since dropping the Polish Peasant Party from its coalition in early March. A poll by the OBOP agency published on Tuesday and conducted between March 8-10 showed 75 percent of the population disapprove of the government, while only 17 percent approved. The government's ratings have slipped steadily this year, with 60 percent disappoving of its performance in January and 70 percent disapproving of it in February, according to polls. mrm/jmy/yad Poland-politics
