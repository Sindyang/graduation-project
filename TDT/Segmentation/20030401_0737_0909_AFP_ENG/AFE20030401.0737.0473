Amnesty International on Tuesday criticised Myanmar's military government for its glacial pace of prisoner releases and a lack of other steps taken since its first-ever visit there in January. In a statement received here, the rights group said it welcomed some limited improvements in the human rights situation, but was disappointed other urgent steps have not yet been taken by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to improve the rights situation. "The SPDC has told the organisation that political prisoners now have access to reading materials and social contact, which are positive developments," the statement said. "However over 1,200 political prisoners are still held in prisons throughout the country, and the pace of releases has decreased considerably in the last four months... "During our visit, we submitted a number of lists of political prisoners, whose releases should be a first priority for the SPDC. Yet to our knowledge none of these people have been released," it added. The group also noted that arrests of people for their peaceful political activities began again in July last year. "Amnesty International has recently submitted a list of 27 such people to the SPDC, and is seeking further information about them." The junta has freed a few hundred prisoners in the last two years as goodwill gestures, but has failed to release any recently -- with the exception of a group of 45 people released a few days before a UN human rights envoy arrived there last month. The envoy, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, cut his trip short after he discovered bugging equipment in a room where he was interviewing political prisoners. Amnesty visited Myanmar over January and February this year. Demelza Stubbings, Amnesty's interim program director for Asia-Pacific and head of the mission to Myanmar, said in Bangkok after the visit that Myanmar had shown some improvement in the human rights realm, particularly in the treatment of prisoners. "(But) much remains to be done, and we will continue to point out what it is," she said. The United States Tuesday also slammed the SPDC for its "extremely poor" rights performance in 2002. "The regime's human rights record remained extremely poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," the report said. Myanmar's junta has long been criticised for its poor human rights record, which rights groups and western governments have said includes forced labour, censorship and violations of religious freedom. sb/rcw Myanmar-Amnesty
