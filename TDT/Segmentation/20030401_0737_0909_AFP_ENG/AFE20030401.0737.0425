The Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer Tuesday praised the Qatari television station Al-Jazeera and said its freedom of expression should be respected. Al-Jazeera "is an independent channel which makes use of its freedom of expression. The freedom of expression and independence of al-Jazeera must be respected by players in the international community," he said. Schwimmer criticised a decision taken by the New York Stock Exchange last week to suspend the accreditation of two journalists with the Qatari channel. An official confirmed on condition of anonymity that the decision was made because of the war against Iraq. US officials have criticised the television station -- increasingly popular in the Middle East -- for representing a one-sided version of the Iraqi war and for broadcasting pictures of coalition dead and prisoners of war. The Council of Europe was set up after World War II to promote democracy and human rights and now comprises 44 member nations. bur/hs/yad Iraq-war-Europe-media
