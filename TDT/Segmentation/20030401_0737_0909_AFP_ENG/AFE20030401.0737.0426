A leading ally of a Nigerian state governor was shot dead after returning from a day's campaigning, a state official said Tuesday, the latest in a series of murders in the run-up to key general elections. Gbenga Ogunremi, spokesman for Governor Adeniyi Adebayo of the southwestern state of Ekiti, said that businessman Yemi Oni was shot dead in his home late on Saturday by unidentified gunmen. "On Saturday he went for a rally in his home town with the governor," he said. "Afterwards he visited some friends before returning home. Fifteen minutes later they came in and shot him." No-one else was hurt in the attack and nothing was stolen from the house, he said. "I've just met with the police, they are still investigating," he added. "Yemi Oni was not really a politician, he was more of a businessman and a friend of the governor," he said. Nigeria's first elections since the end of military rule four years ago are due to begin on April 12 with legislative elections. Presidential and state gubernatorial polls are to be held a week later. As campaigning heats up a wave of political violence has gripped the country, with ethnic unrest in the Niger Delta hitting oil exports and the murders of a series of leading politicians. Ogunremi said that Ekiti, where Adebayo is campaigning for re-election under the banner of the opposition party Alliance for Democracy (AD), has so far been spared the worst of the trouble, except for one other attack. "In December last year there was a women's leader of the AD who was splashed with acid. She died a few weeks ago and by coincidence will be buried on Saturday on the same day as Oni," he said. More than 10,000 Nigerians have been killed in mob violence since President Olusegun Obasanjo's 1999 election heralded the end of 15 years of increasingly brutal military rule. That poll was organised and tightly controlled by the the military regime and this month's elections have been billed as the first key test for the young democracy in Africa's most populous country. Already observers have raised fears that the violence and instability in the country could prevent many voters from getting to the polls. dc/nb Nigeria-vote-unrest-killing
