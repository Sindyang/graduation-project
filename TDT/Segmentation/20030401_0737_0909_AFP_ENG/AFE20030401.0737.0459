The general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, Nong Duc Manh, will pay an official visit to China from April 7 to 11, China's foreign ministry said Tuesday. The visit comes at the invitation of Chinese President Hu Jintao, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters at a regular briefing. "China hopes the visit will further promote Sino-Vietnamese relations," Liu said. Relations between China and Vietnam have maintained a good momentum over the past few years, Liu said. The two sides have settled their border issues and have maintained frequent exchanges of high-level visits, Liu said. Trade and economic cooperation is also recording new progress, he added. Ideological soulmates but historical rivals, China and Vietnam fought a brief but bloody war along their common border in 1979 following a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. They subsequently clashed over territorial claims in the South China Sea in 1988 and 1992. But the relationships between the two countries have improved significantly recently, with Vietnam congratulating China's new leadership last year. cs/rcw China-Vietnam-FM
