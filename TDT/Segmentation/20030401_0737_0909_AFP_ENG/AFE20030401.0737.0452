Two coalition warplanes on Tuesday dropped laser-guided munitions on an Iraqi radio relay facility near the western desert outpost of Rutba, the US Central Command said. "The Coalition targeted the station to erode the command and control capabilities of regime leaders," a statement said, restating part of the strategy of US-led forces to try to bring down President Saddam President. "A full assessment of the strike's effectiveness is in progress," Centrol Command added. Rutba lies 125 kilometres (75 miles) east of Iraq's border with Jordan and 320 kilometres (200 miles) from Baghdad. bp/mb Iraq-war-US-radio
