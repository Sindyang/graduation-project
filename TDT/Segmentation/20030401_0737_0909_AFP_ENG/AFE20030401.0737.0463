Athens has called in Frenchman Pierre Bideau, the lighting effects designer at the Eiffel Tower, to illuminate the Lykavittos hill overlooking Athens ahead of the 2004 Olympics, newspapers said Tuesday. Bideau, who designed the spectacular millennium firework display at Paris' towering monument, was to arrive in Athens on Tuesday to hammer out details. The project, provisionally budgeted at 600,000 euros (641,000 dollars), was masterminded by Michalis Kakoyiannis, director of the 1960s cult movie "Zorba the Greek". The city of Athens has secured funding for its long-term maintenance. pap/hb/jkb Greece-France-offbeat
