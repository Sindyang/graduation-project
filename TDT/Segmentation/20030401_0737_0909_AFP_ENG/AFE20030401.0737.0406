Oman on Tuesday introduced an exit toll for vehicles crossing its borders in a bid to boost non-oil revenues in the face of reduced crude output. Cars, taxis and minibuses will have to pay two rials (six dollars) on leaving the sultanate, while vehicles weighing 7 tonnes and more will be charged eight rials. Trucks transporting agricultural, livestock and fish products for marketing outside Oman will pay an annual fee of 20 rials and stone quarry lorries operating near the border 100 rials. The toll will be automated from July 1. Citizens in border areas who travel daily and buses hired by the education ministry to carry students have been exempted from the fee. Oman, which is not an OPEC member, is currently producing about 763,000 barrels a day, down from 850,000 in 2001. str/lp/bp/mb Oman-oil-travel-toll
