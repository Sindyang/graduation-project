ROME, April 1 (AFP) - AC Milan's veteran Brazilian midfielder Leonardo said Tuesday he is retiring from football early so that he concentrate on his duties as the Italian club's assistant vice-president. The 33-year-old, who played in the 1998 World Cup final defeat by France, returned to Milan last October having left them in the summer of 2001 to play back home in Brazil. Originally he said he was going to quit at the end of the current season when his player contract expires, but has decided to hang up his boots now so he can focus on boardroom duties. "I have chosen to stop my football career before the end of the season because I have so many things to look after apart from playing that it becomes impossible to combine training with all my other engagements," he said. "I am looking forward to working for the club which has shown great respect and love towards me." Leonardo last played for Milan on December 22 against Brescia. sb/ak Fbl-BRA-ITA-Leonardo
