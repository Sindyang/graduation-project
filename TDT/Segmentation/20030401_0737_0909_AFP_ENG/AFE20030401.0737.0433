Nigeria's main labour movement said Tuesday that two weeks before the start of key national elections it had reached an agreement with government to halt a threatened public sector pay strike. A three-day warning strike was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension until after polling day, labour and government officials said. But the last minute decision to call off the action did not filter down to all government employees, AFP found, and some staff in federal offices in Lagos failed to turn up to work. Nigeria has been gripped by fuel shortages and a rising tide of ethnic and political violence in the run up to the elections, and the Nigeria Labour Congress's (NLC) decision will come as a relief to government. The news will also be welcomed on the world oil markets, which are already nervously eyeing ethnic unrest in the south of the country which has seen Nigeria's crude exports slashed by 40 percent. "We held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo ... and the labour minister, and we agreed to suspend the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," NLC spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "The government has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the issue of the 12.5 percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will honour the agreement this time," he added. The deal would directly affect Nigeria's legions of federal government workers, including those in state oil production, telecoms and power firms, but will also be seen as a benchmark for state governments and the private sector. A statement released by the presidency signed by President Olusegun Obasanjo and NLC president Adams Oshiomhole confirmed that an interim agreement had been reached. "At the instance of the federal government, the leadership of the NLC met leadership of the federal government to deliberate on the issue of a 12.5 percent salary increase for workers," it said. "It was agreed that both sides shall work out the modalities for implementing the salary increase as it affects all grade levels. A joint committee to work out this has already been set up," it said. It said a supplementary budget on the pay hike will be sent to parliament for approval, and called on workers to show patience. But at the Federal Office of Statistics in Lagos a security guard turned an AFP reporter back at the gate. "You cannot find anybody. Aren't you are aware that we are on strike?" he said. He said the decision to stage the walkout passed to them by officials of the Trade Union Congress, a sister union of the NLC. On March 12, the NLC had threatened to call an indefinite national strike from April 1 because of the government's failure to honour a pay agreement, but by Sunday it was scaling back its threat. "We have limited the strike to three days in order to ensure that the forthcoming elections are conducted peacefully," Oshiomhole told reporters. Lakemfa said Tuesday that the impending poll had influenced the union's decision. "We do not want to heat up the system ahead of the general and presidential polls in April," he said. "There are lots of bad things going on such as political assassinations, long queues for petrol, that it will be unreasonable to add to the sufferings of the masses." Nigeria is to hold legislative, governorship and presidential elections this month, in the first test of the troubled west African nation's experiment with democracy since the 1999 return of civilian rule. A series of assassinations, riots and protests has raised fears that -- in a country which has seen more than 10,000 people killed in less than four years -- the polls could be marred by violence. In the Niger Delta region of the south, a violent uprising by ethnic Ijaw militants has forced oil multinationals to evacuate facilities producing more than 800,000 barrels per day, more than a third of normal output. joa-ola/nb Nigeria-social-strike
