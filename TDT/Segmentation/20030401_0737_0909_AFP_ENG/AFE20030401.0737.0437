Four Russian soldiers were killed and another wounded when a landmine exploded in the southern republic of Ingushetia, bordering war-torn Chechnya, on Tuesday, the defence ministry said. "A mine was found near the village of Ali-Yurt during an inspection mission prior to the passage of a military convoy. The mine exploded as the sappers were approaching," spokesman Nikolai Deryabin said, as quoted by the Interfax news agency. "As a result of this terrorist act, four soldiers were killed and another was wounded," he said. Russian officials routinely describe actions by Chechen separatists, whom they have been fighting since Moscow sent troops into the republic in October 1999, as "terrorists." meg/bb/ds Russia-Chechnya-Ingushetia
