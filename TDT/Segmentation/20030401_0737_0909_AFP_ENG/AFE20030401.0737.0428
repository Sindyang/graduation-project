Some 20 young Russians stripped off naked in a smart Moscow shopping street Tuesday to win a free mobile phone in a promotion to mark the first day of spring. The Euroset chain had posted a large sign outside its shop-window promising: "Anyone who comes naked between 9.50 am and 10.15 am will get a Motorola phone." Hoardes of people descended on the store, located a stone's throw from the Kremlin, from seven in the morning, hoping it was their lucky day. "A crowd of curious onlookers and girls and young men hungry for freebies created chaos outside our shop, glued to the windows and trying to force their way through the closed doors," spokeswoman Tatyana Gulyaeva said. But with the number of free handsets restricted, only the first 20 visitors willing to bare their bodies for the photographers' flashlights got their prized possession. "When we opened, the 20 telephones were snatched up in 15 minutes. There turned out to be more volunteers than phones. Happy spring!" said Gulyaeva. via/hm/jkb Russia-offbeat
