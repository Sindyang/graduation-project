Civilian losses are regrettable but unavoidable in war, a senior US commander said here Tuesday a day after US troops killed seven women and children in a van at a military checkpoint. "Our efforts may result in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result in the loss of Iraqi military lives," Brigadier General Vincent Brooks told a press briefing here at the US Central Command's forward planning base. "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they remain unavoidable as they have been throughout history." Brooks had been asked if the checkpoint shooting, which took place near Najaf in southern Iraq, would affect the coalition's efforts to win "the hearts and minds" of the people of Iraq. US military officials said US troops opened fire on the vehicle after it ignored two warnings to stop. Four civilians were injured in the attack, according to US officials. Iraqi officials claim more than 600 civilians have been killed in air bombardments on Baghdad and other attacks across the country since the start of the US-led war against President Saddam Hussein on March 20. nh/mb Iraq-war-US-civilians
