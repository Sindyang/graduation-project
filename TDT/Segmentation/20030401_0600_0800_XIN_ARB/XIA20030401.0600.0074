The  people  enjoy  the  Chinese  selection  of  the  workplace and  place  to  live,  and  to  take  individual  decisions  on  the way  of  life,  freedom  of  travel  within  and  outside  China and  these  freedoms  to  change  the  face  of  Chinese  society. Similarly,  Australia  welcomes  the  efforts  made  by  China  to push  ahead  with  economic,  social  and  cultural  rights  of  its people,  and  actions  taken  to  protect  the  rights  of  women and  children.  It  also  is  being  done  considerable  work  to implement  the  concept  of  the  rule  of  law  in  China.  Some of  China's  commitment  to  human  rights  such  as  those  relating to  freedom  of  speech,  assembly  and  association  pact  has  improved compared  to  pre-reform.  However,  compared  with  a  lot  of  states, there  is  continued  work  to  be  done  practices  in  China  in accordance  with  all  universally  accepted  norms  of  human  rights and  that  Australia  was  pleased  with  the  government  and  the people  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  in  such  cases. Mr.  Ali  Hussam  Edin,  ambassador  of  Egypt  :  In  general,  the current  situation  of  human  rights  development  in  China,  together with  the  positive  development  for  society  as  a  whole.
