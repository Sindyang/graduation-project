Mr.  Bayer,  the  Hungarian  Ambassador  :  Change  the  situation of  human  rights  in  China  over  the  past  decades.  Thanks  to the  legal  reform,  which  has  been  its  inception  in  1978, the  Chinese  law  has  witnessed  remarkable  growth  in  terms of  quantity  and  quality.  During  the  quarter-century  since the  end  of  the  Cultural  Revolution,  began  the  People's  Republic of  China  in  terms  of  the  most  well-coordinated  effort  individual national  legal  development  in  the  history  of  China.  The  results were  impressive  and  returned  would  benefit  the  Chinese  society as  a  whole.  Hungary  monitors  efforts  Chinese  great  sympathy is  ready  to  provide  its  experience  gained  during  the  past decade  during  the  transition  to  democracy  and  the  rule  of law  and  a  market  economy.  The  recent  history  of  China,  Hungary, traditional  friends  and  the  challenges  that  they  had  to  be overcome  in  the  past  many  common  features.  That  is  why  State began  a  dialogue  on  human  rights  in  2000.  We  believe  that the  open  and  constructive  exchanges  of  views  on  human  rights issues  with  China  to  benefit  the  two  sides.  Experience  has shown  that  the  Hungarian  market  economy  is  acting  as  well and  the  rule  of  law  are  linked  closely  connected  to  their respective  market  mechanisms  can  only  operate  in  a  climate of  systematic  legal  reliable.  I  am  convinced  that  China  on track  towards  full  implementation  of  these  ideas,  even  if they  were  quite  different  historical  and  cultural  background of  the  background  of  Hungary.  Mr.  a  ambassador,  ambassador of  Indonesia  :  With  most  developing  countries  to  make  progress in  human  rights  situation  in  the  country,  especially  China's economy  has  developed  rapidly  in  recent  years.  The  Chinese people  enjoy,  enjoyed  by  the  peoples  of  the  developed  countries. They  are  free  to  travel  to  any  place  Liberals  to  prefer them  as  long  as  they  are  committed  to  the  law  and  regulations in  the  country.  Mr.  Jose  be,  Mexican  minister  :  China  and Mexico  to  take  the  same  situation  with  regard  to  the  subject construction  to  explore  further  ways  and  means  of  cooperation in  the  payment  of  positive  support  human  rights  forward. In  September  of  2001,  visited  the  vice-minister  of  human rights  Mexican  Acosta  China  very  fruitful  and  a  series  of meetings  with  Chinese  organizations  in  China  on  human  rights. To  move  forward  in  making  this  dialogue  a  priority  for  us. During  the  visit,  expressed  his  admiration  for  the  Mexican side  of  the  great  progress  achieved  by  China  in  the  protection of  the  right  to  subsistence  and  development  and  promotion and  protection  of  ethnic  minorities  ad  hoc  effective  ways to  grant  them  self-government  at  different  levels  of  self-rule, as  well  as  broad  religious  freedom.  On  the  other  hand,  it is  important  to  note  that  the  two  countries,  as  two,  adopt the  same  position  and  that  there  should  be  human  rights as  a  pretext  to  interfere  in  internal  affairs  of  any  country. We  are  fully  aware  of  the  efforts  to  build  a  society  pleasant untiring  efforts  of  China  in  a  comprehensive  manner,  including the  further  development  of  the  economy,  and  the  improvement of  democracy,  science,  education  and  pushing  forward,  enrich culture,  and  the  promotion  of  social  harmony,  and  the  upgrading of  the  composition  of  the  people's  lives,  as  well  as  the rule  of  law  and  the  rule  of  virtue  in  accordance  with  approved by  the  National  Conference  of  the  Group  of  16  of  the  Communist Party  of  China.  This  solid  foundations,  China  has  seen  constant improvement  in  human  rights  as  compared  with  the  situation before  the  year  1949.
