China  expressed  strong  dissatisfaction  with  the  unreasonable charges  and  resolutely  opposed  by  the  United  States  on  human rights  situation  in  China.  This  was  stated  by  the  foreign ministry  spokesman  Liu  Jian  Chau  today,  Tuesday.  In  response to  a  request  to  comment  on  the  part  of  China's  special report  on  human  rights  practices  of  2002,  which  has  just published  by  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  of  America, Liu  said  that  the  report  disregards  the  facts  and  deplores China  without  cause.  Liu  added  that  the  Chinese  government has  always  devoted  itself  to  the  promotion  and  protection of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  and  recorded  achievements in  this  respect,  them.  He  pointed  out  that  the  Chinese  government and  people  of  all  ethnic  groups  from  all  walks  of  life are  building  a  bright  future  with  full  confidence.  He  said in  reply  that  it  is  advisable  to  the  American  side  to  reflect more  of  its  problems  and  the  cessation  of  interference  in internal  affairs  of  other  states  under  the  pretext  of  human rights  as  well  as  to  abandon  double  standards  in  the  field of  human  rights  in  order  not  to  continue  to  ruin  its  credibility to  the  world.
