The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) asked the Venezuelan government on Tuesday to ensure the safety of a humanitarian mission to a strife-torn region along its border with Colombia, from which hundreds of civilians are reportedly attempting to flee. The UNHCR wants to send an evaluative mission to the isolated Rio de Oro region in northwest Venezuela, where the arrival of Colombian paramilitary forces two weeks ago has forced at least 200 civilians, including 90 children, to leave their homes, a spokesman said. Unconfirmed reports say that another 600 people, including members of the indigenous Bari community, have fled the mountainous zone. Colombian left-wing rebel groups are fighting right-wing Colombian paramilitaries in the area, occasionally engaging the Venezuelan army. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that he had ordered aerial bombing in the frontier zone to prevent an incursion by an armed Colombian group, without specifying which side in the conflict they represented. jlv/co/ds UNHCR-Venezuela-Colombia
