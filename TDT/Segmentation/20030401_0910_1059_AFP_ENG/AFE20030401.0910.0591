Three Afghan border guards, including a commander, were killed in an ambush by suspected Taliban in the southwest Afghan province of Nimroz, bordering Pakistan, a local offical said. "Yesterday (Monday) at 9:30 in the morning five men armed with Kalashnikovs and machineguns attacked the car of a border commander who was on his way from Kang district to the centre of Nimroz," said Aminullah, secretary to the governor of Nimroz. "Commander Najibullah himself, and two of his men were killed. He was head of a detachment of border guards in Kang district, bordering Pakistan," he told AFP by telephone. "The car was stolen and later found in the neighbouring province of Farah, but the attackers had fled," said Aminullah, who like many Afghans has just one name. "It is a political act, it is the Taliban or fighters of (former premier and renegade warlord) Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who carried out this assassination," he claimed. Armed attacks have risen in recent days in south and southeast Afghanistan, homeland of the Pashtun tribes, from whom the majority of the Taliban came. wm-hba/mtp/rj/th Afghanistan-attacks
