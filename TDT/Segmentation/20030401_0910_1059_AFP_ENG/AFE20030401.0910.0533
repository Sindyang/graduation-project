Five firms have opened talks with the Bulgarian government over plans to build a nuclear power plant at Belene, on the Danube river, the Bulgarian energy ministry said on Tuesday. Russia's Atomstroieksport, US firm Westinghouse, France's Framatom, the Czech company Skoda and Atomic Energy of Canada have each briefed the ministry on which technology they propose to use. The ministry is due to decide on the basis of this information and to open a tender process for the nuclear power station, which would be Bulgaria's second, before the end of the year. The Bulgarian government began building a nuclear plant at Belene in 1987 but suspended it three years later under pressure from environmental groups. It decided at the end of 2002 to resume construction. The nuclear plant should become operational in 2008, and will cost an estimated billion dollars (920 million euros) to build, according to the government. So far the state has invested 1.3 million dollars in infrastructure for the plant. It has bought steam generators and a casing for a 1,000-megawatt water pressure reactor from the Czech Republic. Belene lies 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the west of Kozloduy, home to Bulgaria's only other nuclear power station. Two 440-megawatt Soviet-type reactors at Kozloduy were shut down in December and two more are due to be closed down by 2006, under an agreement with the European Union. Kozloduy supplies 45 percent of Bulgaria's electricity and also has two more modern 1,000-megawatt reactors whose future is not in doubt. vs/aro/ef/lmf Bulgaria-energy-nuclear
