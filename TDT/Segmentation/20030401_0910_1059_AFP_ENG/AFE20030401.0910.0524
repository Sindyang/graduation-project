Morocco will beat its tourist drum more loudly to counter a decline in visitors caused by the war in Iraq, Tourism Minister Adil Douiri said Tuesday. The number of tourists visiting Morocco has fallen less than 10 percent since the beginning of the Iraq crisis, he said, predicting the decline would remain "fairly weak" for now in the context of the war. Douiri said the ministry was launching an "action plan" that includes redirecting promotional budgets toward institutional communication. The Moroccan tourism sector was devastated by the fallout from the first Gulf War in 1991. atl/vs/lmf Iraq-war-Morocco-tourism
