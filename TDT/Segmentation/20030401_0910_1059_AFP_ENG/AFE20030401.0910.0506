WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US President George W Bush has complete confidence in Donald Rumsfeld, White House officials said Tuesday in the face of continuing criticism over the defence secretary's handling of the US military campaign in Iraq. "The president has tremendous faith in secretary Rumsfeld and his generals, secretary Rumsfeld's leadership, secretary Rumsfeld's decisions and that's borne out by what the president views as a successful military campaign," a White House official said on condition of anonymity. The New York Times kept the heat on Rumsfeld Tuesday, publishing several articles on accusations from senior military officers that he has interfered to limit the number of battlefield troops in Iraq. Reporting from the US V Corps headquarters near the Kuwait-Iraq border, the paper referred to "long-simmering tensions" which have "erupted in a series of complaints from officers on the Iraqi battlefield that the Pentagon has not sent enough troops to wage the war as they want to fight it." "Raw nerves were obvious as officers compared Mr Rumsfeld to Robert McNamara, an architect of the Vietnam war who failed to grasp the political and military realities of Vietnam," the paper said. jld/jsl/mac Iraq-war-US-Bush-Rumsfeld
