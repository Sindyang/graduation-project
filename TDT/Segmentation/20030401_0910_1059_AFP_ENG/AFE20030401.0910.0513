Serious disruption can be expected to the Paris transport system Thursday as a result of a national strike by unions over pension reform, the city's transport authority RATP said. Metro, bus and tramway services in the capital will be severely cut, as well as RER commuter trains, it said. The strike at RATP will begin at 3:00 am (01H00) and end on Friday at 6:30 am (0430 GMT), the CGT union said. Unions representing flight-controllers and ground staff at airports are also calling on members to join Thursday's day of action, and the civil aviation authority (DGAC) was due to announce a reduced programme of national and internatiponal flights. Around 85 demonstrations are planned around the country Thursday to put pressure on the centre-right government as it formulates proposals for reforming the country's pension system. bur/hs/ns France-transport-strike
