CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US Marines driving towards Baghdad captured a key canal bridge Tuesday after stiff fighting south of the central Iraq city of Hilla, their officers said. An AFP correspondent traveling with elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force said the troops were backed by artillery and two B-52 heavy bombers in their drive to take the canal. "There was good resistance initially," Major Cal Worth said of the Iraqis. "But again we finished them up. We continue to push on according to schedule." Scores of tanks and armored personnel carriers were seen rumbling towards the canal near Hilla, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) due south of Baghdad. The marines are part of a general push towards the capital to topple the regime of President Saddam Hussein. Further west, the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division and 101st Airborne Division are also gearing for a move against elite Republican Guard units defending the approaches to Baghdad. np/pm/hc Iraq-war-marines-bridge
