Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Tuesday expressed hopes that the United Nations Security Council would reach an agreement on a resolution for the reconstruction of Iraq after the current war. "This should be possible even if the Council disagreed about the military action currently underway," Rasmussen told reporters, adding: "It is in the interest of all countries to come together on the reconstruction of Iraq." "But I must say that if the Council does not reach agreement on this, others will have to take care of it because we cannot leave the Iraqi people to face their destiny alone," he said in a veiled reference to the United States. Concern has mounted in Europe that Washington intends to sideline non-US companies in the process, after the very first reconstruction contracts were awarded to US firms last week. France has repeatedly called for a UN-supervised administration in Iraq to oversee the reconstruction process. Rasmussen, whose country is part of the US-led coalition fighting in Iraq -- although it has sent no ground or airborne forces -- said he believed the UN had to play a central role in Iraq after the war. "This is not just a question of repairing the damage inflicted during this armed conflict, but also the reconstruction of damage inflicted on an Iraqi society hit by 12 years of economic santions and subjected to the tyrannic regime of Saddam Hussein," he said. He said Danish companies had not received any orders for the reconstruction of Iraq. The head of maritime transport and petrol group A.P. Moeller, Denmark's largest company, said last week he saw commercial possibilities for his group in the reconstruction of Iraq. sa/po/ds Iraq-war-UN-Denmark
