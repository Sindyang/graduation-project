European Development and Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Poul Nielson warned Tuesday against involving US and British troops in the distribution of emergency humanitarian aid to Iraqis. In an interview with the Danish daily Politiken, Nielson said the United States and Britain have been keen to show that their troops are in Iraq to help the Iraqi people, but that involving them in humanitarian aid could do more harm than good. Images of heavily armed US and British troops handing out food and water to hungry Iraqis have been cabled out around the world. "To let soldiers distribute emergency aid puts in danger all those who are normally involved in impartial humanitarian aid. The role of neutral aid workers is weakened by this interference, because it will be difficult for them to approach people in need," he said. "People should be able to seek out the aid they need from humanitarian organisations and not from an occupying power," said Nielson, who is currently in Africa. sa/po/ns Iraq-war-EU-US-Britain-aid
