WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US employers, freezing decisions to hire and fire during the Iraq war, announced 38 percent fewer job cuts in March than in February, a survey showed Tuesday. Planned job cuts slid to 85,396 in March, the lowest level in six months, from 138,177 in February, said a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas Inc. "March marked the culmination of the war build-up, and it clearly caused American businesses to put major decisions and actions on hold. One result: job cuts fell to their lowest level since September, 2002," said the firm's chief executive, John Challenger. "Corporate America is stuck in limbo. The one thing we do not expect is significant job creation," he said. The number of job cuts in March was down 17 percent when compared with March 2002. By sector, transportation cut the most jobs in March, announcing 19,397 reductions as airlines weathered a crisis. Electronics came second with 17,051 cuts and the government sector third with 11,493 cuts. Over the first quarter of 2003, employers announced 355,795 job cuts, down 26 percent from a year before. The government sector, which had been one of the bright spots in terms of job creation last year, swung the biggest axe in the quarter with 61,658 job-cut announcements. "As unemployment climbs, revenue from payroll taxes continues to shrink. States are also suffering from a drop in sales tax revenue, as consumers finally appear to be reining in spending," Challenger said. "As a result, government agencies are being forced to make significant cuts wherever they can," he said. The retail sector, suffering from weaker consumer spending, came second, announcing 52,463 job cuts in the three months. Transportation was third with 31,114 job cuts posted in the quarter. djw/rl US-economy-jobs
