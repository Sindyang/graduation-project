Sun City, a casino resort in the South African bush, has been the setting for talks which facilitators say will see it immortalised as the place where Africa's biggest conflict was settled. Nestled under the Pilanesberg mountains, Sun City has hosted some 360 government, opposition, rebel and civil society delegates from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a final session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue. George Ola-Davies, spokesman for Sir Ketumile Masire, chairman of the talks, said he believed that concluding the Sun City negotiations ranked in significance with cities where famous agreements were adopted. "This ranks with places like Lusaka, where several peace accords have been signed, or Rome," said Ola-Davies. "Sun City is magnificent for a big country like the DRC -- it will be so nice to talk of the Sun City agreements," he told AFP. On Wednesday, delegates, in the presence of an expected 10 heads of state, will sign final agreements to end the process towards a transition in the vast central African country that was set in motion here 14 months ago. Some 150 kilometres (95 miles) west of Pretoria, the hotel complex has long hosted world events in entertainment. In 2001, the crowning of Miss World was followed by two annual two-million dollar Sun City golf challenges. But never before has the resort, with its kitsch African "Lost Palace", hosted a massive forum with the political profile of the Congolese dialogue, which started here on February 25 last year. The resort is no stranger to political controversy. Built by hotel magnate Sol Kerzner in the "tribal homeland" of Bophutatswana in the late 1970s, Sun City was a gambling and fleshpot getaway from repressive Calvinistic laws thought up by Afrikaner leaders wearing black homburg hats. Bophutatswana was a so-called independent "bantustan" created by apartheid's architects. Its laws were not heavy-handed when it came to gambling and pornography, treated as dire vices elsewhere in South Africa. It also gave generous tax breaks to anybody willing to invest there. But Sun City's willingness to acknowlege the bantustan in which it was built legitimised "grand apartheid" -- the term used to describe white South Africa's segregationist policies. Many artists refused to play at the Sun City Superbowl in the 1980s because of this association. Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr and others under the banner of Artists United Against Apartheid released a protest song against Sun City in 1985. "Bophuthatswana is far away. But we know it's in South Africa no matter what they say...I ain't gonna play Sun City," the lyrics go. With the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa's laws on gambling and pornography relaxed and the lure of "Sin" City gradually diminished. No more was it necessary to drive for hours for the pleasures of the flesh when they were at the nearest video store, and a gambling casino might be a few minutes down the road. Sun City needed to reinvent itself, and in 1992, Kerzner set new aims to lure people. Instead of going downmarket, he went up, targeting mainly overseas visitors who could pay extravagant prices and enjoy unheard-of luxury at the newly opened Lost Palace, crown piece of South Africa's Las Vegas in the bushveld. An awe-inspiring piece of architecture, it sports live-size statues of elephants and antelope made from copper and other metals. The imitation tusks lining the hotel's roof reinforce the publicity stunt on which the complex is built. "Fleeing the barbarians of the northern deserts, a gentle, cultured people wandered ever southwards," press releases trumpeted. "For years they roamed their wild continent, through steaming jungles and razor-backed mountains until they found it... A valley silvered by crystal streams, cloaked in lush forests." The line is still believed by gullible tourists and local day-trippers who go there to gamble, play golf and catch the African sun on an imitation beach at the Valley of the Waves. Down the road, one finds the Superbowl, the Cascades Hotel complex and the original Sun City hotel, in which the cling-clang of one-armed bandit slot machines never ceases. It is a strange setting for closing deliberations on one of Africa's most complex conflicts. jhe/hn/nb DRCongo-talks-SunCity
