WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US manufacturing activity slumped in March as the run-up to the Iraq war sapped demand and extinguished a four-month expansion, a survey showed Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) purchasing managers' index, based on a survey of supply executives, slid to 46.2 points in March from 50.5 in February. A reading below 50 points indicates an industry contraction. "The manufacturing sector failed to grow in March, marking the end of four consecutive months of growth," the survey chief, Norbert Ore, said in a statement. "Supply managers continue to be challenged by business conditions," Ore said. "The start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization," Ore said. A breakdown of the figures showed: -- The ISM production index crumbled to 46.3 points in March from 55.4 in February, showing the first contraction in manufacturing production in 16 months. -- New orders retreated, with the new orders index sliding to 46.2 points in March from 52.3 in February. -- Employment shrank faster, with the employment index retreating to 42.1 points in March from 42.8 in February. -- The backlog of orders dwindled, with the index slumping to 41.5 points in March from 49.30 in February. "March was not a good month for manufacturing, as the sector appears to have lost its momentum," Ore said. "Employment continues to be a problem as the index has now been below 50 percent for 30 months." Manufacturers liquidated their inventories at a faster rate, the survey showed, with the inventories index sliding to 42.3 points in March from 43.8 in February. Prices paid by manufacturers rose for the 13th month. The index climbed to 70.0 points from 65.5 in February. New export orders rose but at a slower pace. The export orders index fell to 52.0 points from 55.5 in February. djw/tw US-economy-ISM
