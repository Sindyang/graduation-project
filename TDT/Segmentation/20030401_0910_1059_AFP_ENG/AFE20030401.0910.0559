Dora Bakoyiannis, the first woman to become mayor of Athens, testified on Tuesday in the special court trying 19 alleged members of an armed group that claimed reponsibility for killing her husband in 1990. "Why did you kill Bakoyiannis?," she icily asked the defendants from the witness box as the trial of alleged members of the November 17 urban guerrilla group continued. "Read the proclamation," replied Dimitris Koufontinas, the group's alleged top assassin, referring to the reasons given by the group at the time, which related to an alleged financial scandal. Koufontinas has assumed political responsibility for November 17 actions, but denies individual charges. The group, blamed for a wave of political killings over three decades, notably claimed responsibility for the murder of Bakoyiannis' husband Pavlos in 1990. Bakoyiannis is the daughter of Greece's former prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis and also number two in the country's main opposition party. November 17 had accused Bakoyiannis of being involved in a financial scandal that shook Greece in the late 1980s. But his widow testified that the group killed the journalist and conservative MP because he helped engineering the rapprochement between Greece's Right with the country's communist Left. This cooperation led to the overthrow of the country's scandal-tainted socialist government of the day. November 17 is held responsible for 23 political assassinations of Greek and foreign officials between 1975 and 2000. Its members had evaded security forces until last year when Greek authorities -- under pressure to get security under control ahead of next year's Olympic Games -- made their first arrests. On Monday, George Petsos, a former socialist minister who narrowly escaped a November 17 attack, accused the group of trying to kill him, possibly in cahoots with Greek intelligence services, as he said, in order to make him a scapegoat for the same scandal. dk/pap/ds Greece-trial
