Russia on Tuesday accused US authorities of misleading both domestic and international opinion by manipulating media reports on the war in Iraq, which Moscow strongly opposes. "We have all seen the bias in the information provided, the violations of the rights of journalists and the way they deceive the American public and the international community as a whole," a spokesman for the press ministry said in a statement, as quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency. The statement did not cite any examples of the alleged manipulation by US officials. Last week a group of US Congressmen accused the White House of stifling opinion opposed to the US-led invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day. The press media statement came in response to a report issued by the US State Department in which Russia was criticised for alleged constraints on press freedom, RIA Novosti noted. The press ministry "reaffirms the inviolability of the principles of free speech and media independence in Russia and hopes that US statements will be more balanced and unbiased in the future," the statement said. Over the past two years several independent or opposition Russian media organizations have been closed down following alleged pressures or intervention by pro-government structures, giving rise to fears voiced in Washington and elsewhere that the Kremlin was seeking to stifle opposition. ig/bb/hm/jfs Iraq-war-Russia-US-media
