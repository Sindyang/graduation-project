The man accused of masterminding the murder of the Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic is on the run with a Serbian diplomatic passport as well as a fake Croat passport, Serbian police said on Tuesday. Milorad Lukovic Legija "has a false Croatian passport in the name of Vlado Vukomanovic, and in 1996 (under the Milosevic regime) obtained (...) a diplomatic passport," police said, on radio station B92. Legija -- named after his time with the Foreign Legion -- is suspected by police of masterminding Djindjic's murder on March 12. He is also the former commander of the now-disbanded elite police Unit for Special Operations (JSO) and the alleged leader of the Zemun criminal gang, which the authorities have come down hard on since the Djindjic killing. According to a Sarajevo weekly, Legija is hiding out in Bosnia with another former legionnaire, the Croat general Ante Gotovina, currently being sought by the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. Legija was also reportedly seen several times in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar. vs/co/jfs Serbia-attack-Legija
