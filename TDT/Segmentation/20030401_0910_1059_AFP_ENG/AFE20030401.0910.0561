India on Tuesday said it had lost all telephone contact with its embassy in Baghdad following the bombing of a nearby building. "What I understand is that the telephone connections have been cut off. Now our embassy in Amman is trying to contact our embassy in Baghdad," India's foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna told AFP. He said the whereabouts of 14 Indians who had voluntarily stayed back in Iraq was not known. "The 14 Indians have been staying there of their own volition. They were charity workers and Islamic students based in Najaf and nuns in Baghdad. They had been advised to go back," Sarna added. India had shifted most of its staff from the embassy in Baghdad to Amman before the start of the US-led war against Iraq. bm/th Iraq-war-India
