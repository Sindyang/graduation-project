Consumers, glued to television for the opening shots of the Iraq war, sent sales into a slump at major US retail chain stores last week, an industry report said Tuesday. A barometer of sales by retail chain stores drawn up by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg tumbled 1.4 percent in the week ending March 29, the steepest fall since December last year. "The 'CNN effect', which is the tendency for potential shoppers to stay home and watch the war coverage on television, was seemingly instrumental in restraining sales," the survey said. The Iraq war appeared to have a bigger initial impact on chain store sales than in the comparable period of the Gulf War, it said. Sales were generally below expectations, the survey said. Some reports also suggested that stores near US borders suffered as fewer people crossed into the United States to shop. Over February, sales were up 0.8 percent from the same period a year earlier despite harsh weather and the war,according to the tally of 82 retail chain stores. Sales at chain stores in March were expected to be between flat and down 1.0 percent, partly because of the later arrival of Easter, which lands April 20 this year compared to March 31 last year. "The war effect on monthly sales is likely to depress sales as well, but only modestly -- most likely no more than 0.5 percentage points -- since we believe much of that effect already has been depressing sales," it said. Government figures last week showed consumer spending, when adjusted for inflation, fell 0.4 percent in February, the steepest fall since September 2002. Fears of an Iraq war, combined with snowstorms and mass job cuts also sent February retail sales sliding 1.6 percent, the steepest dive since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, government figures showed. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. US consumer confidence, already at a near 10-year low, crumbled again in March in the run-up to the Iraqi war, a survey by the private research group Conference Board showed a week ago. djw/jsl US-economy-retail
