More than 3,000 Arab volunteers in Iraq are ready to carry out suicide missions against the US-led coalition, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Tuesday. He told a press conference in Baghdad that more than 6,000 volunteers had reached Iraq from around the Arab world. "More than half of them, martyrs, are ticking bombs and you will hear talk about them in the days to come," said Ramadan. "This is what we ask of the Arab populations." bur-ml/pad/hc Iraq-war-Ramadan-suicide
