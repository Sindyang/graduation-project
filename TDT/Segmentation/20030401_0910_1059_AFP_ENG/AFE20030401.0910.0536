Luxembourg anti-terrorist police have carried out wide-ranging raids targeting people suspected of links to Islamic extremism, judicial sources said on Tuesday. No one was arrested in the raids on Monday, during which 150 officers searched the homes of some 20 people suspected of having close links with international Islamic fundamentalism, state prosecutor Robert Biever said. Police also raided the offices of a Muslim association which preaches a radical brand of Islam. Documents, video tapes, computer equipment and brochures advocating holy war were confiscated, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. Biever also said the state was considering taking legal action against a group of suspected Islamic extremists. An investigation launched in the wake of the September 11, 2001 extremist attacks has uncovered strong grounds for an indictment on charges of criminal association, the prosecutor's office said. vp/iih/ec/jfs Luxembourg-attacks
