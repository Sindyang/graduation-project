Augusta have scrapped a controversial plan to introduce an age limit of 65 years for past champions to compete in The Masters. Hootie Johnson, chairman of Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, said that the lifetime exemption for past champions will remain a Masters qualification. "After discussions with Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, the Club has decided not to implement the past champions qualification change next year," Johnson said. "Arnold, Jack and I agree that past winners should be able to play as long as they'd like, so long as they feel they remain competitive. We will count on our champions to know when their playing careers at the Masters have come to an end." Palmer, 73, plans to play in next week's Masters and again in 2004, which would bring his years competing in a tournament he has won four times - 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964 - to 50. "I had it in the back of my mind ... that I want to play competitively in the Masters for 50 years," said Palmer. "I am personally very pleased that will be possible now that the matter has been resolved as I hoped it would be. "Jack and I are grateful to Hootie Johnson for his thoughtful consideration of this issue, and thank him on behalf of all of the past champions for retaining this important Masters tradition." The news was also welcomed by German two-time winner Bernhard Langer. "Arnie is welcome wherever he wants to play. I think there will be a time when even Arnie will say, 'It's enough.' Whenever that time is, he will know," said Langer. American golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, a six-time Augusta National champion, confirmed he plans to compete in the 43rd Masters tournament. Nicklaus, 63, skipped the Masters in 2002 with a back problem but said he felt good after a couple of practice rounds last weekend. sg/ea/nr03 Golf-USPGA-Masters
