Defense sources in Monrovia said Tuesday that government troops were "making progress" in the battle to regain control of the northeastern town of Ganta, overrun by rebel forces at the weekend. Liberian President Charles Taylor's private Kiss FM radio, quoting Defense Minister Daniel Chea, said "government troops have encircled rebel forces and were waiting for them to run out of ammunition to launch a final assault on them." The government had said in a statement at the weekend that rebels who attacked Ganta were remnants of a contingent of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) troops who had been repelled from the central city of Gbarnga, near Ganta and about 160 kilometers (96 miles) north of Monrovia. "Government troops attacked the rebels from two fronts with the assistance of traditional hunters using single-barrel shotguns," Chea said. But LURD has denied losing Gbarnga to government forces, in a press statement published in the independent Analyst newspaper. The rebel group also said in the statement that it has forces in several locations throughout Liberia, including Combat Camp, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Monrovia; Klay, 45 kilometers (27 miles) outside the capital, the port city Robertsport, and the towns of Zorzor, Voinjama and Kolahun in northern Lofa County. LURD launched its insurgency against Taylor from Lofa County in 1999. The Liberian government has alleged that the rebels are backed by Guinea, which Monrovia has accused of providing LURD with rear bases. More than 14,000 Liberians have since late last week crossed the border into Guinea, Liberia's northern neighbour, fleeing fighting between government troops and rebels in their own country, according to UN relief workers. Last week, more than 30,000 people were trapped inside Liberia along some 50 kilometres (30 miles) of border territory, between the towns of Ganta and Sanniquellie, UN High Commissioner for Refugees staff said. Refugees have told aid workers that they were on the move because of clashes in the Ganta area. Last week, the Liberian government said it had seized the country's second city, Gbarnga, east of Ganta, back from the rebels. LURD has, meanwhile, denied any involvement in the fighting in southeastern city of Grand Gedeh, home of former Liberian president Samuel Doe, or in Toe or Zwedru, near the eastern border with Ivory Coast. Four WFP workers, all Liberians, were among a group of humanitarian workers kidnapped last Thursday by armed men in Zwedru. Three of them have been released, but the whereabouts of the fourth are still unknown. Two Liberians and one Norwegian working for the US-based Adventist Relief and Development Agency (ADRA) were found dead around a week after they went missing during fighting in Toe on February 28. Monrovia claimed the three ADRA workers had died in a LURD ambush, but the rebels immediately rejected the accusation, saying they did not even operate in southeastern Liberia. In its latest statement, LURD repeated that it "is not operating in Grand Gedeh, Toe Town and Zwedru." "LURD is not a consortium for any group fighting alongside the government of Liberia and insurgents fighting alongside the government of Cote d'Ivoire," Ivory Coast's French name, the statement said. LURD has been waging a three-year war against Taylor, himself a former warlord who came to power in 1997 after a brutal seven-year civil war. tas/kdz/nb Liberia-rebels-unrest
