Life sentence sought for confessed killer of Dutch populist by Gerald de Hemptinne ATTENTION - UPDATES with quotes from defence closing arguments/// AMSTERDAM, April 1 (AFP) - The prosecution on Tuesday called for the man who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader Pim Fortuyn to be imprisoned for life, describing the assassination as an attack on democracy. "This was a murder of freedom of speech," said prosecutor Koos Plooy in his closing argument on the third day of the trial. "Whoever hits the heart of the democratic process must be severely punished," he told the court. Fortuyn was killed in May last year, just days before general elections in which his party was to score impressive gains. On Tuesday, the public gallery of the high security courtroom in Amsterdam known as "the bunker" was packed with Fortuyn supporters who cheered as Plooy announced he would seek life imprisonment. Van der Graaf, a 33-year-old animal rights supporter, confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. In their closing argument his defence lawyers argued that the murder was not an attack on democracy. "Democratic society has not been disrupted," said lawyer Britta Boehler. "It is certain that the elections would have gone differently (without the assassination) but we do not know how," she told the court. The murder of the flamboyant, anti-immigrant Fortuyn stunned the Netherlands which had not seen a political assassination in its recent history. In his confession Van der Graaf said that he shot Fortuyn because he was "a danger to the weaker groups in society"; namely Muslims, asylum seekers, immigrants and animals. According to his defence team Van der Graaf killed Fortuyn because in his mind this was the only way to save democracy. Van der Graaf's attorney Stijn Franken told the court it would be "unthinkable" to sentence his client to life imprisonment for one murder. He pointed out that in the Netherlands the usual sentence for a single premeditated murder starts around 12 years in prison. Van der Graaf has been charged with premeditated murder, threatening Fortuyn's driver with a weapon, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. The prosecution said Tuesday that it would drop a fourth charge of possession of explosive chemicals because Plooy felt he had not presented enough evidence to support the charge. A psychiatric report ordered by the court and presented on Monday concluded that the suspect had some mental problems but was fit to stand trial and could be held responsible for his actions. Fortuyn was shot five times at close range as he left a radio studio in the central town of Hilversum on May 6, 2002, just 10 days before the Dutch general elections. He had rattled the Dutch establishment with his open homosexuality and fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric. But he also won broad favour with many voters who felt there was finally someone who spoke frankly and addressed their concerns. In his closing argument the prosecutor cast Van der Graaf as a cold-blooded killer who liquidated Fortuyn because he did not approve of his political ideas. After Fortuyn was killed, his LPF party went on to score well in the election and to take part in a coalition government. However that administration collapsed in September, and Fortuyn's party crashed in the ensuing elections, held in January. But despite the LPF's fall from grace, Fortuyn's outspoken views and anti-immigrant stance, vigorously attacked before by mainstream politicians, are now openly debated in parliament. The judges are expected to deliver their verdict in two weeks. gdh-sb/gk Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial
