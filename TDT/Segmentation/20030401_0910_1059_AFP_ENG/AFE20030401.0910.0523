President Paul Kagame of Rwanda will not attend Wednesday's signing in Sun City, South Africa, of landmark agreements on post-war transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), his office said. "The invitation only came in on Saturday. The President had other commitments within the country that he was unable to cancel at such short notice," an official in Kagame's office said. On Tuesday, all sides in the peace talks adopted agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year that provide for a two-year transition government to take the DRC through to democratic elections -- the first since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. Rwanda supports one of the largest rebel groups in the DRC, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, and until last year had thousands of its own troops there, saying these were essential to protecting its national security. hv/afm/nb RDCongo-talks-Rwanda-Kagame
