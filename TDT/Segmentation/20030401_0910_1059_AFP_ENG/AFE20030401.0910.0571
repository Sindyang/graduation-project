One of the world's largest aeronautics conglomerates, Bombardier, is planning a massive equity sale combined with a substantial downsizing, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday. The financially troubled conglomerate is planning to sell equity to the tune of up to 680 million dollars (one billion Canadian dollars) and get rid of its recreational products division which produces snowmobiles and jet water-skis. An announcement is expected Thursday and could even include the selling off of the group's troubled Bombardier Capital. The Globe and Mail said CIBC World Markets is organizing the underwriting of the massive restructuring deal which reportedly has the support of more than 125 of Bombardier's top creditors. Bombardier has already faced a major slowdown in purchases of its regional jet range of aircraft and, with the Gulf War continuing at a slower pace than many had believed, cancellations of existing orders are being anticipated. hfw/pfm Canada-Bombardier
