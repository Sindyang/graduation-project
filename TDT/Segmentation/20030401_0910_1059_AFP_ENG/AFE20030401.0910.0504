The head of Iraq's main Shiite Muslim opposition group said here Tuesday the United States was having difficulties in its war on Iraq because it had refused to let the Iraqi opposition take part in operations. But Mohammed Baqer Hakim, head of the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI), said talks between his group and Washington on a post-war Iraq were continuing. "Since the beginning, we advised the Americans to cooperate with opposition groups but they insisted on launching the operation alone, that's why they have so many problems on the ground today," Hakim told AFP. "The Americans, who have a limited knowledge of Iraq and Iraqis, fell into the trap of the Iraqi regime, that has succeeded in leading them into towns and populated areas, which has raised the number of civilian casualties," he said. SAIRI's armed wing, the Badr Brigade, has a trained fighting force estimated to number between 10,000 and 15,000 men, according to diplomatic sources. On Friday, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of allowing hundreds of them to cross into Iraq against US wishes, and said he would hold Iran responsible. "We are neutral in this war but our discussions with the Americans continue," Hakim said, adding his group had told the United States to "limit civilian losses and avoid attacking the population." "We are also discussing with the Americans post-Saddam, stressing the role that must be played by the Iraqi opposition in the transitional regime," he added. "The Badr Brigade forces are Iraqi and independent and have nothing to do with (Iran's) Revolutionary Guards, and that includes brigade forces based in Iran," Hakim said. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi has also dismissed Rumsfeld's charges, insisting that the SAIRI was "completely independent and has nothing to do with the Islamic republic." Hakim, who has been in exile in Iran for more than 20 years, said he would "return to Iraq at an opportune moment, I don't know when exactly." SAIRI's London representative, Hamed al-Bayati, said on March 26 his group -- which has ties to Iraq's Shiite majority -- had opted for "neutrality" in the conflict because it did not want civilians to get involved in a "bruising battle between the allies and the regime." sgh/lal/srj/mb Iraq-war-opposition-Shiites
