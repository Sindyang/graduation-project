The head of the Athens Olympic organising committee (ATHOC) has issued an upbeat bulletin on preparations for next year's Games, but warned that with 500 days to go there wasn't a minute to lose. "We have come a long way in a very short time," Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, president of the Games' Organising Committee, said on Tuesday. But she added: "Even with such progress, we don't have a minute to lose. We have a great deal to accomplish in a very short time. "Despite the pressure we are increasingly confident that our preparations will be completed on time." Angelopoulos-Daskalaki reeled off a number of accomplishments already achieved - top of her list being the near-completion of the Olympic village. The ATHOC boss said a security exercise "with our allies" had passed off without a hitch and she said the Greek government had selected the contractor charged with providing all the technical and communications equipment for the Olypmic security operations. "Operational schedules for all competition and non-competition venues is finalised," she added, "and starting this August we proceed with the test events". "We have a clear plan of what must be accomplished in the 500 days that remain," she concluded. In January International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge praised Athens' preparations as "outstanding" but the Belgian surgeon warned that deadlines were "tight". bur/nr/ea03 Oly-2004-GRE
