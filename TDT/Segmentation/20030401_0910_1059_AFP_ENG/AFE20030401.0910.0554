Italian defence and aeronautics group Finmeccanica said on Tuesday it was preparing a bid for aircraft engine maker FiatAvio with the backing of a US investment fund. Finmeccanica chief executive Roberto Testore said the group had "practically agreed" a deal with US fund Carlyle Group that would form the basis of negotiations with heavily indebted industrial giant Fiat over the possible acquisition of its subsidiary. Finmeccanica chairman Pier Francesco Guarguaglini said his company was "primarily interested in FiatAvio's space activities". FiatAvio is involved in Europe's Ariane space programme, supplying parts of the rocket engines and boosters. Finmeccanica did not say how big a stake it intended to acquire in FiatAvio. ot/lmf/vs Italy-air-company-takeover-Finmeccanica-FiatAvio-Carlyle
