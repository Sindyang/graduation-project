More than 200 would-be immigrants, among them 25 of Iraqi origin, landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa off Sicily by ship, the Italian coastguard announced Tuesday. The ship, spotted by a coastguard airplane patrol, sank 47 miles northeast of the island, after all of its 207 passengers -- 168 men, 17 women and 22 children mainly from Ghana, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Somalia -- had been safely taken to land. They received medical treatment and food at the refugee centre of Lampedusa. Most were transferred to other centres after settling identification formalities, since Lampedusa's facilities are limited to 88 people. African and Asian refugees frequently land on the Italian islands of Lampedusa and Limosa, situated between Tunesia, Sicily and Malta, as they seek access to western Europe. str/ljm/iih/gk Italy-immigrant
