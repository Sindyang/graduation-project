David Beckham revealed Tuesday that he feels "insulted" by criticism of England's lacklustre recent performances and sprung to the defence of under-fire manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. Speaking on the eve of Wednesday's crucial Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey, Beckham admitted he had been hurt by suggestions the current England squad lacked the passion of their predecessors and dismayed by the widespread finger-pointing at the low-key style of their Swedish coach. "I'm the captain so I do feel personally insulted when people say the passion is not there," Beckham said. "I wouldn't say it affects me but it does annoy me." "Whether its on the manager's part or the players, I find it hard that the passion is being questioned within the team." Beckham insisted that Eriksson's dislike of the high-decibel "motivational" techniques traditionally employed in British football, should not be taken as a sign that he cares any less. "He might be different from other managers but to question his passion is wrong. He is a very passionate person and he is a very passionate manager." Eriksson, typically, seemed unperturbed about how he has come to be perceived and the criticism that goes with it. "I am like I am. To change character at my age would be very difficult and I've no intention of doing it." The Swede's cool, unexcitable style was initially hailed as one of the keys to his success in salvaging England's qualifying campaign for last summer's World Cup after he took over from Kevin Keegan. But after reaching the quarter-finals of last summer's World Cup, England have failed to reproduce anything like that early form and Eriksson now finds himself the subject of the kind of intense questioning of his abilities that forced Keegan out of the job. Beckham admitted he did recognise some parallels between the end of Keegan's reign and the current atmosphere surrounding England, but he insisted Eriksson was capable of proving his critics wrong and pleaded for him to be given a chance to do so. "I think what people should remember is that he has got great respect for people over here and I think that should be shown back," Beckham said. "He is doing a great job here to the best of his ability and he has got great ability as a manager and I think he should be appreciated for that. "If we go out and win this game it might be lifted for a short while but then when the next game comes up we have to do it again and again." Beckham was England's best player in their unconvincing 2-0 win over Liechtenstein on Saturday, scoring one of his trademark freekicks. His performance is likely to be critical again on Wednesday, although it could be his defensive ability that counts more this time as he will have the task of shackling Inter Milan's Emre Belozoglu, the virtuoso element in Turkey's impressive midfield quartet. "He's obviously technically very good but we're not worrying about any individuals," Beckham said. "They've got very good technical players in midfield and they are very dangerous if we give them time. But it is up to not to give them time and beat them." Victory on Wednesday would lift England to a point above Turkey at the top of the group and make them favourites to clinch the one automatic qualifying spot for next summer's finals in Portugal. The runners-up in the group can still qualify through a play-off against another second-placed side. Beckham said a draw would keep England's chances of winning the group alive. "If we draw the game, of course we would not be happy but I think we are capable to going to Turkey and winning there." am/ak Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Beckham
