Baseball pushed the Iraq war to the margins of the front pages on Tuesday, as the New York press mourned the prospect of a season without superstar Yankee's shortstop, Derek Jeter. After weeks of non-stop war coverage, the New York Post allowed its focus to switch from Baghdad to Toronto, where Jeter dislocated his shoulder Monday in a season opener against the Blue Jays. "Agony - Jeter's disaster" ran the Post's banner headline. A blow-up photograph of the all-star shortstop lying on the ground, clutching his shoulder, dominated the front page above a compressed report on an attack on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. The same picture -- albeit in smaller format -- also made the front page of the Daily News, Newsday and USA Today. Jeter suffered a dislocated left shoulder in a violent collision at third base with Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby during the third inning. There were fears that the injury could put him out for the rest of the season. The prominence given to the incident was a combined reflection of Jeter's celebrity status and the sense of anticipation surrounding the opening day of America's national pastime. Jeter's good looks have made him baseball's pin-up boy and he is as well known for his romantic liaisons off the field as his sporting prowess on it. gh/mac Baseball-Iraq-war
