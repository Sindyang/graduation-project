Attackers fired automatic rifles at a police post near a train station used by tourists heading to the famed statue of Christ overlooking Rio de Janeiro, police said Tuesday. Police said the attackers fired from a car during the night and fled. They said there were no casualties. But it was the latest incident in a campaign by the Brazilian city's notorious drug gangs. On Monday, two police were killed when their patrol came under fire from some 30 heavily armed drug traffickers, who comandeered vehicles and set them alight, blocking part of a major road running through the Bonsucesso district. At the same time, the Meridian hotel on Copacabana beach and a neighbouring supermarket were attacked with Molotov cocktails, while another gang sprayed the Del Castilho metro station with bullets. Officials said the latest attacks were a response to the imprisonment Friday of traffickers connected to Brazil's principal drug lord Luiz Fernando de Costa, alias "Fernandinho Beira Mar". The rising drug-related violence, including the assassinations this month of two judges and the threatening of as dozens more, have led to fears of the "Colombianisation" of Brazil's until now relatively low-key drug trade. pfm/tw Brazil-violence
