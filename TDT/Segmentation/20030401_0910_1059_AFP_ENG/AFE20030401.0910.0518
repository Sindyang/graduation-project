Two dozen people Tuesday jumped out the rear door of a Cuban airliner held at Havana airport by a man claiming to be armed with two grenades who asked to be flown to Miami, according to AFP reporters at the scene. The group was taken away by bus after escaping the Soviet-made AN-23 which initially had 46 people on board. The plane had been en route from the Isle of Youth to Havana late Monday when the hijacker ordered the crew to head for Miami but it had to land at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport to refuel. cd/pfm/mac Cuba-plane
