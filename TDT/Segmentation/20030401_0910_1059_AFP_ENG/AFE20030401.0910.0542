France has failed to take steps to control its budget and will have a public deficit for both this year and next well in excess of the EU's three-percent limit, according to a highly critical European Commission report obtained by AFP Tuesday. The report -- which is the first stage in the disciplinary procedure launched after France posted a 2002 public deficit of 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- was due to be formally adopted by the commission Wednesday. It predicts a public deficit this year of 3.7 percent of GDP, followed by 3.6 percent for 2004 -- exceeding by a large margin the three-percent limit set down in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. The report says the excess spending cannot be explained only by the deteriorating economic situation and blames France for not taking the necessary measures to bring it under control. It also predicts that France will breach the pact's rules on public debt, which is not supposed to exceed 60 percent of GDP. But France's will hit 61.3 percent in 2003 and 62.8 percent in 2004, according to the report. The commission bases its calculation on a French economic growth figure of 1.1 percent for 2003 and 2.1 percent for 2004. phv/hs/vs EU-eurozone-France-economy-deficit-debt
