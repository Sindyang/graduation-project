Two Palestinians threw stones at the US consulate in annexed east Jerusalem on Tuesday, Israeli public radio said. One of the men was arrested by police and the other managed to escape, the radio said. The US-led war against Iraq has aroused considerable anger among Palestinians, who have drawn parallels between the invasion of Iraq and Israel's long-standing occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have marched in protest at the war across the territories. In Gaza City on Tuesday, some 1,500 Palestinians turned out in front of the parliament building to burn a coffin draped in US, British and Israeli flags, shouting slogans denouncing the war and the silence of Arab leaders in the face of the conflict. In Bethlehem in the southern West Bank, some 1,000 gathered in front of a church marking the birthplace of Jesus Christ to condemn the war. The demonstration also marked the first anniversary of a siege in the Church of the Nativity which started when Israeli troops a year ago raided the town, as they did almost the entire West Bank, to hunt down militants. Around 200 people, including many gunmen, sought sanctuary in the church, starting a six-week siege that ended in the exile of 13 gunmen. The crowd demanded on Tuesday that the exiles be allowed to return. str-chw/jh/srj Iraq-war-US-Palestinian
