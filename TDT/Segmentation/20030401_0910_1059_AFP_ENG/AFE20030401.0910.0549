WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US manufacturing activity slumped in March as the run-up to the Iraq war sapped demand and extinguished a four-month expansion, a survey showed Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) purchasing managers' index, based on a survey of supply executives, slid to 46.2 points in March from 50.5 in February. A reading below 50 points indicates an industry contraction. "The manufacturing sector failed to grow in March, marking the end of four consecutive months of growth," the survey chief, Norbert Ore, said in a statement. "Supply managers continue to be challenged by business conditions," Ore said. "The start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization," Ore said. djw/mac US-economy-ISM
