One person was killed and a dozen others injured Tuesday in a grenade explosion triggered by suspected Muslim militants in Indian-administered Kashmir, a border guard spokesman said. Militants had thrown the grenade at a security force patrol, but it missed the target and exploded among passers by at the town of Anantnag, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer capital. One of the injured was a policeman, a border guard spokesman said. He added that two of the injured were in critical condition. Police have sealed off the site and were searching for the militants responsible. More than 38,000 people have died in Indian Kashmir since the start of anti-India rebellion in the scenic Himalayan region in 1989, although separatists put the toll twice as high. str/bm/th India-Kashmir-blast
