American Airlines appeared Tuesday to have staved off bankruptcy after reaching last-minute deals with three unions to secure 1.8 billion dollars in cost savings for the world's biggest airline. AMR Corp. parent company of the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline, asked all employees, including management, for a total of 1.8 billion dollars in permanent, annual savings to help save the debt-ridden company. The announcement came late Monday, as the company was preparing to file for creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. "By taking these decisive actions, the union leadership and our employees have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the future of the company, and have enabled us to avoid an immediate filing with the bankruptcy court," the company's chairman Don Carty said. Analysts said the deal bought time for AMR, but there is no guarantee it will not follow United Airlines, US Airways and Hawaiian Air into bankruptcy. Morgan Stanley analyst William Greene said he was maintaining a cautious stand and "underweight" rating for the company "until we are convinced of the company's future viability." But JP Morgan said said in a note it was upgrading AMR from underweight to "neutral," based on the company's expected renewed access to capital, improvements in cash burn rates, and materially reduced (Chapter 11) risk." While the broker noted that AMR is "not out of the woods entirely", the airline, along with Delta Air Lines "now enjoys the relative luxury of time." The cost-cutting deal came a day after the Allied Pilots Association announced its proposal meeting American Airlines' targets for 660 million dollars in contract cost reductions. Additional cuts in costs for the airline amount to 340 million dollars from flight attendants, 620 million from workers represented by the Transport Workers' Union, 80 million dollars from agents, representatives and planners, and some 100 million dollars from management and support staff. American Airlines had said in a statement Sunday that, "Face-to-face negotiations continue around the table, around the clock with the mechanics, flight attendants and pilots." The company also said that company chairman Carty would take a 33 percent base pay cut, decline a bonus for the third year, and ask the board of directors to significantly reduce the value of his and his senior officers compensation packages. American employees will have access to a new stock option and profit sharing program. The deal still needs approval from the unions' memberships. The company also needs to secure "meaningful concessions" from its vendors, lessors and suppliers, Carty said. American Airlines is one of many US airlines in severe financial difficulties amid a general economic downturn and a slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The number two carrier United Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection last year. US Airways announced Monday its emergence from seven months of bankruptcy, after slashing 1.9 billion dollars a year in annual costs under bankruptcy court supervision. The US airline industry last week appealed for some four billion dollars in government aid, saying the Iraq war and terrorism fears had pounded air travel. bur-rl/tw US-air-American
