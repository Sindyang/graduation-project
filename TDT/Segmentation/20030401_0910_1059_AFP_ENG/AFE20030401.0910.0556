Residents of Paris's Chinatown were watching with apprehension Tuesday the continuing spread of the unidentified killer disease atypical pneumonia, with many in the French capital considering putting off voyages to the east for fear of catching it. "We're all waiting to see what happens before we buy our tickets," said Philippe Nguyen, an art dealer who is planning a business trip to North Vietnam. "All the family is saying that there's no risk there, but I am cautious. I would rather take the risk of ordering goods without seeing them than of falling ill," he said. Around 40,000 people originally from east Asia live in a high-rise area of the 13th arrondissement, or district, south of the river Seine. Most of them are ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. At a local travel agency -- CFA Voyages -- staff report 30 percent of trips cancelled or postponed. Next door, baker Yv Nghy says he will spend his holidays in Europe this year. "I was going to go to Hong Kong, but it's not sensible," he said. At a pharmacy in the Massena 13 shopping complex, would-be travellers come to buy face masks, pneumonia vaccines and other drugs they hope may give protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), but they are told not to bother. "Mask or no mask, it is better not to go. As long as the pathogen remains unidentified, it is impossible to protect onself properly," said Sylvie Larnaudie, chief pharmacist. Those most at risk are the elderly -- mainly Laotians and Cambodians -- who are unable to read French and so remain uninformed about the progress of the disease. "My job is to tell them," said Dr Suda Viengchai at the pharmacy. "They come here looking for medicine kits for their journey -- pills to stop diarrhoea or paracetamol. That's when I explain to them the precautions to take, the symptoms to look out for, and who to contact if they have doubts." cnp/hs/jfs Health-pneumonia-France
