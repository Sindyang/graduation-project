Portugal are building seven new stadia and completely renovating three others ahead of the 2004 European championship which they host from June 12 to July 4. More than 4,000 people have worked on the stadia which are located in eight cities across Portugal, and will cost an estimated 800,000 million euros (872 million dollars) to complete. ESTADIO DA LUZ Location: Lisbon Club: Benfica Capacity: 65,000 Cost: 124 million euros (135 million dollars) Workers: 702 Conclusion date: September 30, 2003 Features: While its seating capacity will be less than the 120,000 that Estadio da Luz, which it replaces, Benfica's new stadium will still be Portugal's largest. Billed as Portugal's "new cathedral to football" the stadium features 7,000 VIP seats and two large screens. The ceiling is made of policarbonate, a lightweight transparent building material which will let in natural light. To maximize the amount of natural light the stadium receives, there will be a gap between the start of the ceiling and the end of the seating stands. More than a quarter of the cost will be swallowed by construction of the roof. The surrounding commercial area features a health club, a panoramic restaurant, 55 bars and various movie houses. The stadium will host five matches, including the final on July 4.
