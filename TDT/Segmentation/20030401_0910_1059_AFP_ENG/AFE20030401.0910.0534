The UN's World Heath Organisation said on Tuesday that outbreaks of a deadly respiratory virus were being contained in Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada, with the main concern now centring on Hong Kong and China's Guangdong province. "Vietnam has contained the outbreak, Singapore is rapidly containing the outbreak, Toronto is rapidly containing it, so we don't anticipate that there will be spread from these places," David Heymann, head of the WHO's communicable diseases unit, said. But Heymann warned that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong -- which accounts for 530 of the 1,633 cases reported worldwide by WHO's headquarters since November last year -- may have taken on a "new form". Hong Kong authorities were rushing to see if a cluster of cases in a hotel and quarantined appartment block there might have been passed on by water, sewage or ventilation systems. "We will know tomorrow morning whether or not (the Hong Kong authorities) have been able to confirm that all the cases that they have now are still by person-to-person contact," Heymann told journalists. But the cluster there might equally have been caught from close contact in a lift or from a door handle touched by someone suffering from SARS, he said. A WHO team in Beijing was still trying to get regional authorities to allow them to go to China's Guangdong province, the source of the outbreak last November which is thought to account for about 806 cases. "We believe that an invitation will be coming, and as I say every day we haven't yet received that invitation," Heymann commented. "We believe that the outbreak is still going on in Guangdong from what the government has told us," he added. At least 58 people have died of SARS since November 2002, 34 of them in Guangdong, according to WHO. pac/kjm/ds Health-pneumonia-WHO
