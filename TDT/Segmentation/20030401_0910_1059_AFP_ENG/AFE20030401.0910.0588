Iraqi tribal forces fight alongside US troops in Iraq: US military by Stephen Coates ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details on attack, background /// AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - Around 100 Iraqi tribesmen have fought alongside US troops in central Iraq and more are expected to join the battle against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a US military spokesman said Tuesday. General Vincent Brooks said the local militias attacked with troops from the First Marine Expeditionary Force near the towns of Diwaniyah and Shatra, south of Baghdad. "Approximately 100 tribal men joined the coalition forces in these attacks, and resulted in the captures of enemy prisoners of war, weapons, the destruction of bunkers and the removal of explosives from a bridge," he said. "There were no friendly casualties." Coalition commanders were initially hoping to ignite a popular rebellion against the Saddam regime and capture Baghdad with a minimum of fighting. Instead they have met stiff resistance from irregular paramilitaries and militiamen loyal to the ruling Baath party, raising concerns that the US-led coalition has blundered into what could become a protracted guerrilla war. Saddam has repeatedly called on Iraq's tribal groups to fight against the foreign invaders. Iraqi television last week reported that peasant gunmen had shot down a US helicopter, a claim dismissed by US officers. But there have been signs that tribal elders, who command small groups of lightly armed men, are prepared to defend Saddam against the might of the US and British military. Brooks told reporters at coalition headquarters here that US-British troops were receiving more and more assistance from ordinary Iraqis, despite growing civilian casualties in the war. "We've operated in a variety of areas and in close contact with tribal leaders and tribal members. Where we can find an access point or find someone who is interested in contacting us, we will pursue that," he said. He said information from local people had helped US special forces and regular troops in raids against regime "death squad locations" and Baath party headquarters around Baghdad. Locals had also lent assistance to British soldiers around the southern city of Basra, resulting in the destruction of a "considerable amount" of Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers. In the north, American soldiers also have been working with local Kurdish fighters to coordinate ground and air attacks against Iraqi positions and alleged terrorist bases. US special forces troops and CIA agents reportedly roamed the countryside of Afghanistan with suitcases full of money to buy the allegiances of warlords ahead of the attack on the Taliban regime there in late 2001. Local tribesmen are still playing a central role in Afghanistan as they help US troops hunt down the remnants of the Taliban and the al-Qaeda terror network. While such operations were generally considered a success, some of the Afghan warlords were accused of providing poor intelligence which led to air strikes on civilians. Brooks said he could not give details on how Iraqi tribesmen were recruited or where they came from, but added he expected more of them to ally themselves to the coalition as the Saddam regime weakened. "We think we're going to see a whole lot more of those (tribal forces) in the coming days as they continue to show up ... As the regime is pushed back, peeled back or destroyed, people will start seeking freedom for themselves," he said. smc/srj Iraq-war-US-tribal
