Hong Kong canto pop singer and actor Leslie Cheung plunged to his death from a hotel in the city's financial district, reports said Tuesday. Local media said Cheung, 46, who earned international acclaim for his portrayal of an opera star in the 1993 historical epic 'Farewell, My Concubine', had committed suicide. Cable Television reported that Cheung had left a note saying he was suffering from emotional problems before his death at the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong's Central district. A police spokeswoman refused to fully identify the dead man, saying only that a 46-year-old surnamed Cheung had died in hospital after falling from the 24th floor of a hotel in Central. "We received a report that a man had fallen from the Mandarin Hotel at around 6.40pm (1030 GMT)," the spokesman said. "The man, a 46-year-old surnamed Cheung, was taken to the Queen Mary Hospital and declared to be dead at 7:00 pm (1100 GMT). Police found there were no suspicious circumstances." Local television and radio reports identified the dead man as Cheung. Cheung was one of Hong Kong's most popular performers, notable for being one of only a few Asian stars to play openly gay characters. He came out about his sexuality after playing one of his most famous gay roles in the acclaimed 1997 movie 'Happy Together', directed by Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai. Cheung entered showbusiness after returning to Hong Kong following studies at Leeds University in northern England. He achieved success as a canto-pop singer and enjoyed Asian-wide fame with his successful 1981 album 'The Wind Blows On'. Cheung's success as a singer quickly paved the way for a career in film. Though he was to become noted for playing gay roles later in his career, Cheung made his breakthrough playing a rookie cop alongside Cantonese heart-throb Chow Yun-fat in John Woo's 1986 action movie 'A Better Tomorrow'. Two years later he earned a reputation for romantic roles after playing an opium-smoking playboy in Stanley Kwan's 'Rouge', one of the most successful films to emerge from Hong Kong during the 1980s. Further collaborations with action guru Woo followed with 1990's 'Once A Thief', before Cheung teamed up the following year with director Wong for 'Days of Being Wild'. rcw/th HongKong-people-Cheung
