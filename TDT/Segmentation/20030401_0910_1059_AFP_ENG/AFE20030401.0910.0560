WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Vice President Dick Cheney has indefinitely postponed an April trip that would have taken him to China, Japan, South Korea and Australia, in order to devote his full attention to the war against Iraq, his office said Tuesday. "This is not the right time" for the voyage, Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise said without confirming the vice president's itinerary apart from the stop in China. "It's an important region, and we believe it's a trip we should do at a time that allows for it," said Millerwise, who noted that Bush in January cancelled a trip to Africa for "the very same reason." The spokeswoman did not mention a new target date for the trip, which US President George W. Bush announced last October as he welcomed then-Chinese president Jiang Zemin to his beloved Texas ranch. Cheney would have travelled to Japan, South Korea, as well as Australia -- which has contributed combat troops to the US-led war effort Iraq -- according to administration officials who declined to be named. China has followed France's lead in opposing the military campaign to disarm and topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The visit would have brought Cheney face to face with Chinese President Hu Jintao for the first time since Hu took office, even as Washington courts Beijing's support for ending Pyongyang's nuclear arms program. The United States is trying to convince China to back a multilateral forum to discuss the crisis, but Beijing has thus far been cool to the idea and instead promotes bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea. News that Cheney was putting off this trip came after the US Centers for Disease Control and the US State Department warned Americans to postpone non-essential trips to Asia due to the spreading outbreak of a deadly pneumonia known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Millerwise said that was not a factor in the decision. The virus claimed another life on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong man succumbing to the disease. SARS has now killed 34 people in China, 16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. It also came as China rejected as "irresponsible" a US report that accused the country of having a poor human rights record and told the United States stop meddling in the affairs of other nations. The US State Department on Monday accused China's communist leaders of presiding over a "poor" human rights record last year, saying the government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses. Human rights have long been a source of contention between the two countries, which while enjoying improved relations in the past year due to cooperation in fighting terrorism and booming trade, have not ironed out key differences such as rights matters. ok/mac US-China-Cheney-postpone
