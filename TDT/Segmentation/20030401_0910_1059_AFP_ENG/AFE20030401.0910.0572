French parliamentarians on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for the government's planned privatisation of Air France, adopting a text that would see the government give up its controlling stake in the flag carrier. "I think we've put together the best possible plan, which fulfills our determination to protect the interests of French airlines, those of Air France and in particular those of its employees," said Transport Minister Gilles de Robien. Under the plan, approved by lawmakers from the ruling UMP party against vociferous opposition from the Socialists and other left-wing groupings, the government would sell most of its 54.4 percent of Air France, leaving it with a minority stake just below 20 percent. Most of the stake would be sold to private shareholders, with 15 percent earmarked for Air France staff -- who currently hold 12.7 percent of the company. The plan would also give the company tight control over its own operating licence and international access rights, helping to protect it against any foreign takeover. De Robien told the senate in February that the privatisation would take place in mid-to-late 2003. "The government intends, obviously, to protect the interests of the taxpayers," he said at the time. "The operation will not be undertaken until market conditions allow." However, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government badly needs privatisation revenues to help reduce its burgeoning debt -- now edging close to the European Union-imposed limit of 60 percent of gross domestic product -- at a time when tax cuts and falling growth are paring its revenues. The government last month reduced its 2003 growth forecast to 1.3 percent, just over half the 2.5 percent forecast underpinning its budget for the year. cl/lmf/vs France-air-AirFrance-privatisation
