Eight people were killed and four wounded when a minivan carrying coal miners hit a landmine in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, officials said. The miners were heading home for a holiday when they struck the landmine in the Loralai district of Baluchistan province, some 470 kilometers (around 295 miles) southeast of the provincial capital Quetta. Tribal rivalries linked to the coal mines have resulted in sporadic clashes. str/rj/th Pakistan-mines
