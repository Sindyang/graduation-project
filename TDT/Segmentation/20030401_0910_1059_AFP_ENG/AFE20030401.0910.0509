The top Turkmen election official on Tuesday insisted that a series of weekend elections would prove the democratic credentials of the isolated and repressive Central Asian state. "There is not one neighbourhood lacking alternative candidates for voters to choose from -- this demonstrates that pre-election campaigning has occurred on competitive democratic principles," Murat Karyev, chairman of the central election commission told AFP. Voting on Sunday will be for a national people's assembly of 65 people and for 5,535 local councils, as well as four parliamentary by-elections, the election commission said. Ex-Soviet Turkmenistan has been condemned most recently by the pan-European rights body the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which accused it of "mind-boggling" human rights abuses in a report published in March. The people's assembly usually meets annually to issue guidance on the overall direction of government policy, rather than to pass legislation. Elections to parliament, which is tasked with passing legislation, are due next year. The election comes as President Saparmurat Niyazov attempts to improve his image following international criticism of a wave of repressive measures which followed an alleged assasination attempt against him last November. "The contrast between the law as it is presented and the reality marked by terror and fear is mind-boggling" said the OSCE report, which questioned whether an assasination attempt had actually taken place and the subsequent conviction of 62 people including several former ministers. Turkmenistan has prevented the OSCE from observing previous elections and the pan-European body's Ashkhabad office declined to say whether it would be monitoring Sunday's election. Turkmenistan's electorate numbers some 2.2 million people out of a population of 4.7 million. str/njc/hm/jfs Turkmenistan-vote
