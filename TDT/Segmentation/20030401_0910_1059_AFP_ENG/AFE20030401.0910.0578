A final act to be signed at Sun City on Wednesday to establish a government of national unity in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after four years of brutal warfare provides for integrating rebel fighters in a restructured national army. Under agreements reached among rival DRC sides in the South African resort, amnesties will be offered for war-related deeds. Main points: FIGHTING AND ARMED FORCES: Signatories renew commitments to cease hostilities and embark on the process of setting up a restructured and integrated army as agreed during discussions in Sun City last year. The new army will include fighters of the Ugandan-backed Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) and Rwandan-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), rebel splinter groups, and the pro-government Mai-Mai militia. Their headquarters staffs met in Pretoria in March, but only the RCD has signed an agreement on the military. Agreement was reached on withdrawal of foreign troops and disarmament of armed militias. SECURITY: Each political leader will have the right to five to 15 bodyguards. No extra government troops may be deployed to Kinshasa. The police force will be integrated. The international community will be asked to provide a neutral force to secure politicians and institutions until the integrated police force can be deployed. CONSTITUTION: Declares the global and inclusive agreement of December 17 and the constitution to be the only sources of power during a two-year transition to elections. It declares the inviolability of the fundamental liberties and rights of the individual. OBJECTIVES: Reunification, pacification, reconstruction, restoration of territorial integrity and reestablishment of the state's authority throughout the country. Organisation of free and transparent elections at all levels. PRINCIPLES OF TRANSITION: Institutions must have appropriate representation from the 11 provinces and different political and social tendencies. Women must take part at all levels. The president, vice presidents and presidents of the Senate and National Assembly cannot be removed unless they commit grave crimes. Institutions will operate on the basis of consensus, inclusivity and non-conflict. Amnesty will be accorded for war-related deeds with the exception of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. LENGTH OF TRANSITION: Elections to be held within 24 months of investiture of the transitional government, but this period may be extended for six months, then a second six months, to cope with logistical electoral problems, by agreement of an independent electoral commission and the two houses of parliament. TRANSITIONAL INSTITUTIONS: The following will be created: an independent electoral commission; a human rights observatory; a media high authority; a truth and reconciliation commission; a commission to oversee ethics and the fight against corruption. POWERS: The president nominates senior officials, and has the power to declare war with the agreement of the cabinet and parliament. VICE PRESIDENTS: Four vice presidents will be drawn from the government, the MLC, the RCD and the political opposition. MINISTRIES: Thirty-six ministries are split among the government, rebels, the Mai-Mai and the political opposition and civil society. Interior and finance go to the government, defence and state enterprises to the RCD, foreign affairs and the budget to the MLC. PARLIAMENT: The speakership of the National Assembly -- the last major sticking point -- goes to the MLC, which argued that it needed it for a fair balance of power. The National Assembly will have 500 members and the Senate 120 members, designated by the signatories. JUDICIARY: The first president of the Supreme Court, the attorney general and the military auditor general will be appointed immediately under a balancing mechanism to be agreed by the signatories. jhe/hn/nb DRCongo-talks-points
