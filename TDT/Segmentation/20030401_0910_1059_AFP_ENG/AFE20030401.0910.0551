Germany's postal service, Deutsche Post, said Tuesday that it had suspended staff travel to some Asian countries amid concern about a respiratory virus that has killed more than 60 people. The company said its employees would no longer travel to China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore until further notice and that it had advised personnel not to make any private trips to the countries. Deutsche Post employs some 380,000 people world wide, although the number of employees likely to travel regularly to and from Asia for business purposes is not known. The illness, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, then spread to Hong Kong and more than a dozen other countries, infecting some 1,900 people. Business meetings that had been planned in the region would now be conducted by video conference, Deutsche Post said. loc/jfs Health-pneumonia-Germany-post
