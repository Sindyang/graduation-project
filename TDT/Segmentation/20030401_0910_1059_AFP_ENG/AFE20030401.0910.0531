The southern outskirts of Baghdad were pounded by an especially intense bombardment Tuesday that sent balls of fire and towers of black smoke into the sky, an AFP journalist in the Iraqi capital said. Massive explosions rocked the area around 4:30 pm (1330 GMT) in what was at least the third wave of bombings since dawn. Heavy bombing boomed out from the city's southern rim and the ack-ack of anti-aircraft batteries could be heard sporadically on the 13th day of the war. Iraq's Information Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf said 19 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded in strikes on Baghdad since Monday evening. Five of them died and 25 were wounded in Tuesday morning's raids. An AFP reporter saw a missile or smart bomb explode in the heart of the Republican Palace complex, the largest of eight presidential palaces in Baghdad, around 09:00 am (0600 GMT) after a dozen missiles crashed into the Iraqi capital overnight. A huge plume of smoke rose into the air over the sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of Saddam's grip on power which has been a frequent target of the bombardments. Around a dozen missiles struck the Iraqi capital overnight. US Central Command said in a statement that coalition forces had used "precision-guided munitions to target a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad" at around 11:30 pm (1930 GMT) on Monday. The complex served as an office for leaders of the regime and housed the youth ministry and the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, chaired by Saddam's elder son Uday, Centcom said. "The strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities of regime leaders," it said, adding that battle assessment was ongoing. ezz/lp/bp/hc Iraq-war-Baghdad-bomb
