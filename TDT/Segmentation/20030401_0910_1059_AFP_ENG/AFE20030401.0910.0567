WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US stocks of precision bombs are holding up despite an intensifying air campaign over Iraq that has expended thousands of bombs and missiles in the first 12 days of the war, the secretary of the air force said Tuesday. The air force stepped up production of satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) a year before the start of the war, building up "a good backlog," and retains large inventories of laser guided bombs, said Air Force Secretary James Roche. "So no concern as of this point about inventory," he said. Roche said gravity bombs have been used in situations where they are more effective that precision weapons, but most strikes have been carried out with JDAMs he said. jm/mac Iraq-war-US-munitions
