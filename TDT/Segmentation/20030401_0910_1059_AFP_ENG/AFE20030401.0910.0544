The top election official in Turkmenistan on Tuesday insisted that a series of weekend elections would prove the democratic credentials of the isolated and repressive Central Asian state. "There is not one neighbourhood lacking alternative candidates for voters to choose from -- this demonstrates that pre-election campaigning has taken place on competitive democratic principles," Murat Karyev, chairman of the central election commission told AFP. Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, has been condemned most recently by the pan-European rights body the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which accused it of "mind-boggling" rights abuses in a report published in March. Voting on Sunday will be for a national people's assembly of 65 people and for 5,535 local councils, as well as four parliamentary by-elections, the election commission said. The people's assembly usually meets annually to issue guidance on the overall direction of governmental policy, rather than to pass legislation. Elections to parliament, which is tasked with passing legislation, are due next year. The election comes as President Saparmurat Niyazov attempts to improve his image following international criticism of a wave of repressive measures which followed an alleged assassination attempt against him last November. Niyazov fears being targeted as a rogue leader by the US-led allies who are currently trying to unseat Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, the head of the Institute of War and Peace Reporting's Kazakhstan office, Edward Polyetayev, said. "Niyazov worries that he could be next. His only source of support is his people and the election will bring forward new people devoted to him. At the same time he hopes to improve Turkmenistan's image," Polyetayev said. But Western countries will take a lot of convincing that Turkmenistan can hold democratic elections. "The contrast between the law as it is presented and the reality marked by terror and fear is mind-boggling" said the OSCE report, which questioned whether an assassination attempt had actually taken place and the subsequent conviction of 62 people including several foreign ministers. Turkmenistan has prevented the OSCE from monitoring previous elections and the pan-European body's Ashkhabad office declined to say whether it would be monitoring Sunday's election. In recent months several Western oil and gas companies have halted efforts to develop Turkmenistan's vast gas and oil resources. Turkmenistan's electorate numbers some 2.2 million people out of a population of 4.7 million. str/njc/hm/ds Turkmenistan-vote
