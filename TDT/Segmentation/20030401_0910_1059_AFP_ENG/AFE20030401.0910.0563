Two dozen people leapt Tuesday from the rear door of a Cuban airliner held at Havana airport by a man claiming to be armed with two grenades and asking to be flown to Miami. The group was seen being taken away by bus after escaping the Soviet-made Antonov AN-23 which initially had 40 adults, including the crew, and six children on board. One woman leapt to safety with a child in her arms, witnesses said. The plane had been en route from the Isle of Youth to Havana late Monday when the hijacker ordered the crew to head for Miami, but it was forced by lack of fuel to land at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport. A fuel truck spent nearly two hours beside the aircraft early Tuesday, and it was shortly after that the passengers made their escape. It was not immediately clear whether they were allowed to leave by the hijacker in return for taking on fuel. The plane remained parked on the tarmac, surrounded by a heavy police presence. All flights in and out of the airport have been canceled and inconvenienced passengers have been put up at hotels in Havana. Authorities said they were doing their utmost "to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives of the passengers." The hijacker threatened to detonate the grenades if his demand to be flown to Miami is not met, officials said. "The individual is at the back of the plane, apparently with two hand grenades, and he could possibly have some accomplices" on board, authorities said in a statement. "This act is the direct result of the encouragement US authorities have given hijackers with their incomprehensible behavior in the wake of the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner to the United States by six terrorists armed with knives," the statement said. "The responsibility for what will happen will fall entirely on the government" of the United States, it added. The statement referred to the March 19 hijacking to Florida of another Cuban airliner with 33 people on board after it also flew out of the Island of Youth. That plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, Florida's southernmost island, where the hijackers were taken into custody. Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum in the United States; the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later ruled that the six hijackers could be released on a 25,000 dollar bond pending trial, but the decision is being appealed. Cuban President Fidel Castro criticized the judge's decision and asked if the United States planned to put the six hijackers in a "gilded cage," wondering how their treatment would compare with the spartan conditions meted out to al-Qaeda and Taliban members confined at the US base in Guantanamo, Cuba. Cuba has also been critical of the US policy of granting asylum to any Cuban who manages to set foot on US soil -- like the 11 passengers on the March 19 flight. Those intercepted on the high seas are returned to the communist island. bur/pfm/jsl Cuba-plane
