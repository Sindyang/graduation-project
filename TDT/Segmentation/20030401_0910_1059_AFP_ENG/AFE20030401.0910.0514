A South African man who was part of a group of human shields in Iraq spoke Tuesday of how a potentially fatal encounter with a team of coalition soldiers was saved by a cricket discussion. Abie Dawjee said 20 South Africa human shields were on a bus driving from Baghdad toward the Jordanian border when they saw four tanks parked across the highway. "There were soldiers lying on the ground in a firing position, with their guns pointed towards the bus," said Dawjee. "Our driver stopped near to the tanks and a soldier ordered us to get out. It was terrifying because earlier some motorists had told us that American forces were opening fire on vehicles on the highway. "When we got out they kept their guns pointed at us, but then we heard their accents -- they were Aussies (Australians). We told them we were South Africans and we started to talk about the Cricket World Cup. "That broke the ice and eventually after some negotiations they let us through so that we could go home." srg/hn/kdz Iraq-war-SAfrica-Australia-shields-cricket
