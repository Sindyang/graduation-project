A paramilitary soldier was killed and another injured by tribesmen resisting a government operation to destroy a crop of opium poppies in northwestern Pakistan, officials said Tuesday. The clash occurred in the Mohmand tribal area bordering Afghanistan, where hundreds of paralimitary troops are engaged in uprooting poppies planted in thousands of acres of land in the semi-autonomous region. Witnesses said a tribesman was also killed in the clash. A tribal leader in Mohmand told AFP the situation was tense and sporadic firing was continuing from both sides. The tribesmen have taken positions on the hilltops. Local security officials said they were continuing with their drive to eradicate opium poppies, the raw ingredient for heroin, despite the clash. str-rj/th Pakistan-opium-clash
