WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Vice President Dick Cheney has indefinitely postponed an April trip that would have taken him to China, Japan, South Korea and Australia, in order to devote his full attention to the war against Iraq. "This is not the right time" for the voyage, said Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise, who did not confirm the countries the vice president was to visit in addition to a long stay in China. The spokeswoman did not mention a new target date for the trip, which was announced last October. "It's an important region, and we believe it's a trip we should do at a time that allows for it," said Millerwise, who noted that US President George W. Bush in January cancelled a trip to Africa for "the very same reason." Cheney would have travelled to Japan, South Korea, as well as Australia -- which has contributed combat troops to the US-led war effort Iraq -- according to administration officials who declined to be named. The spokeswoman did not cite the spreading outbreak of a deadly pneumonia, known as SARS, in the region which last week prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to warn Americans to postpone non-essential trips to Asia. The virus claimed another death on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong man succumbing to the disease. Severe Accute Respiratory Syndrome has now killed 34 people in China, 16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore and one in Thailand. ok/mac US-China-Cheney-postpone
