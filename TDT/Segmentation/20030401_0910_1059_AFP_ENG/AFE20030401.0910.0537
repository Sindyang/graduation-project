Swaziland's King Mswati III announced a cabinet reshuffle Monday night, sacking his minister of transport amid fraud allegations six months ahead of general elections. Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini said on national radio the minister of public works and transport, Titus Mlangeni, and the minister of justice and constitutional affairs, Chief Maweni Simelane, would be removed from their positions. Mlangeni was dismissed for allegedly receiving kickbacks during the sale of an aircraft belonging to the kingdom last year while Simelane had been ill for two years and was removed for medical reasons. Dlamini announced two new appointees -- a former sports reporter at the Swazi Observer newspaper, Mahlaba Mamba, and Sipho Shongwe, who was minister of health in the 1980s. "On behalf of his majesty it gives me great pleasure to announce the appointment of two new ministers into cabinet positions and it is his majestys firm belief that the two new ministers would work well and represent him in whatever they will be doing," Dlamini said. Mamba will become the minister of natural resources and Shongwe was appointed the new health minister. The current minister of education, John Carmichael, will replace Mlangeni at public works and transport, and the minister of natural resources, Magwagwa Mdluli, will take over Simelane's position as minister of justice and constitutional affairs. The small mountain kingdom landlocked between South Africa and Mozambique is expected to hold national elections in October. str/fgb/hn/nb Swaziland-politics
