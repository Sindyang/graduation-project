Fifteen members of a family were killed late Monday when their pickup was blown up by a rocket from an Apache helicopter near Hilla south of Baghdad, the sole survivor of the attack told AFP Tuesday. The family was fleeing fighting between Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition in Nasiriyah, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of Baghdad, when the US helicopter fired on the jeep in Haidariya, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the capital, he said. Razek al-Kazem al-Khafaj showed an AFP photographer the coffins he said held the bodies of his wife, his six children, his father, mother and three brothers and their wives. sk/jch/sct/bp/mb Iraq-war-civilian-family
