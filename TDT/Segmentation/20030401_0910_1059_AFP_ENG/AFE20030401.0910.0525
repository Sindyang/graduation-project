Eighty-two percent of French people believe the US is wrong to make war in Iraq, as opposed to just seven percent who think it is right, according to a poll published on Tuesday. The proportion of opponents was up by two points from the last BVA poll on March 21, which showed 80 percent of the public against a war. Some 80 percent of respondents said they believed the war was turning out worse than the Americans had expected. dv/hs/ds Iraq-war-France-poll
