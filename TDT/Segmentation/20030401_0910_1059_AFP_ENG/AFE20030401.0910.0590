The European Commission is to launch formal proceedings against France for the state guarantees it grants to national power giant Electricite de France (EDF), European Union sources said on Tuesday. A proposal to take action against the guarantees, seen by the commission as unfair to rival European power firms, was on the agenda for Wednesday's meeting of the executive, one source said. "Everything's been decided. No further changes can be envisaged," another source said. The development comes after Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said in a newspaper interview last month that he planned to launch proceedings over guarantees to the state-owned company "in the first week of April". France has refused the commmission's call to eliminate the EDF guarantees. The commission's move would give Paris one month to supply legal arguments justifying the state guarantees EDF enjoys on its borrowing, which the commission believes distort competition by improving the company's credit rating and reducing its borrowing costs. France argues the advantages are a fair exchange for EDF's legal obligation to provide a universal service across the country. Monti last October launched a probe into both the state guarantees and tax relief granted to EDF by the French government. EDF is earmarked for partial privatisation by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government, but the sell-off is not expected before 2004. bpi/lmf/vs EU-eurozone-France-energy-company-EDF
