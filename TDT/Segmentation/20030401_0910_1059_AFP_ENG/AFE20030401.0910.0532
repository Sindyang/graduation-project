BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Thursday, official sources told AFP. An EU spokesman confirmed that Powell had asked to meet formally with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, the EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. The meeting, to be held at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, would be followed by an informal lunch with a group of foreign ministers from individual EU and NATO member states. It was not immediately known which foreign ministers would be likely to attend, spokesman Reijo Kempinnen said. Powell is set to arrive in Turkey later on Tuesday for discussions on the US-led war on Iraq, and will travel on to Brussels from there. While in the Belgian capital he will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to the Russian foreign ministry. NATO spokesman Yves Brodeur separately confirmed that Powell would probably take part Thursday in an extraordinary session of the North Atlantic Council, NATO's highest decision-making body. Diplomats said that this meeting could also take place at ministerial level. The US State Department has said Powell hopes to discuss issues related to the invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the post-war future of the oil-rich country. He could raise in Brussels the possibility of involving countries other than the United States and Britain in stabilising Iraq and maintaining order after the end of the war. Washington's strategy in Iraq has deeply divided its European partners and put strains on transatlantic relations. But the 15 EU members agreed at a summit on March 20-21 that the United Nations should play a central role in Iraq during and after the war. European calls for a UN-supervised administration in Iraq are becoming more strident amid concerns that Washington may cut non-US companies out of reconstruction contracts in Iraq. A spokeswoman for Patten, the EU external relations chief, stressed that the 15-nation Union was "primarily concerned that the United Nations should play a key role in Iraq after the war". She said it was too soon for the EU to discuss "concrete projects" in post-war Iraq, and that no hard decisions would be taken during the meeting. "We must above all else listen to the Americans to understand what is on their mind," she said. lby-lb/ec/jfs Iraq-war-US-EU-Powell
