Oman's bourse soared Tuesday to a two-year high thanks largely to the perception of Gulf investors that the market is far removed from the war on Iraq, brokers said. Muscat Securities Market's MSM index, which was the main loser in the Gulf in 2001 and closed 2002 at 191.86 points, finished on 207.57 points. "Oman remains safe and stable despite the war and will attract stock market players," said Ayman Jubeh, brokerage manager of BankMuscat. "Investors from Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are preferring Oman in the present situation," he told AFP. Jubeh forecast continuing interest in stocks after positive 2002 annual reports from many listed companies. The MSM index reached an all-time high of 508 points in 1998 before a massive correction saw it slump to a record low of 152.08 points by end-2001. The Omani bourse has a market capitalisation of around four billion dollars. Many stock exchanges in the Middle East are steadily rising despite the conflict in Iraq, betting on a strong post-war recovery. Even Kuwait's, next door to the war, closed at a new all-time high on Sunday. str/lp/bp Iraq-war-Oman-stocks
