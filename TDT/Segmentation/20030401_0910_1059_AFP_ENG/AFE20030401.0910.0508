Australian star Harry Kewell's future at Leeds United appeared in doubt Tuesday after the English Premiership club announced debts of 80 million pounds (120 million dollars) when they parted company with under-fire chairman Peter Ridsdale. Ridsdale had been reported ready to offer Kewell over two million pounds (3.5 million dollars) a season for four years. But it was not known how new chairman John McKenzie viewed the situation. McKenzie said Monday the club, which sacked Terry Venables 10 days ago after the club had slumped to 16th in the Premiership, faced a challenge of avoiding relegation and balancing the books. One easy way would be to off-load Kewell, whose current deal expires at the end of next season, in the summer. The Australian was rated an 8.5 million pound (13 million dollar) buy. "What happens from here is not something that I can comment on," his manager Bernie Mandic said. rw/ea03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-AUS-Kewell
