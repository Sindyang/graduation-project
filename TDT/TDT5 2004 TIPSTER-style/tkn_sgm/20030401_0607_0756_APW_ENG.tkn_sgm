Israeli warplanes flew over southern Lebanon Tuesday, drawing fire 
from Hezbollah guerrillas that resulted in an anti-aircraft missile 
landing in northern Israel, according to officials on both sides. 
The missile did not explode and no one was injured. Two Israeli jet 
fighters violated Lebanon's airspace by flying at a medium-altitude 
over the market town of Nabatiyeh and the coastal cities of Tyre and 
Sidon, Lebanese security officials in south Lebanon said. Hezbollah's 
anti-aircraft batteries fired on the Israeli jets but missed, the 
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Palestinian guerrillas 
in Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp on Sidon's outskirts, 
joined with volleys of automatic fire directed at the jets. The militant 
Hezbollah group said in Beirut that its air defense unit confronted 
the Israeli planes over the Bint Jbeil border region at 10.35 a.m. 
(0735 GMT) and again over ``eastern sector areas'' at 11 a.m. (0800 
GMT). In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said Hezbollah fired anti-aircraft 
shells at Israel's northern towns. An army spokesman said an unexploded 
missile landed near a school in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona, 
but no one was injured. Since Israel withdrew its troops from south 
Lebanon in 2000, Israeli military aircraft have routinely flown over 
Lebanon on apparent reconnaissance missions, sometimes breaking the 
sound barrier with loud sonic booms and drawing fire from Lebanese 
army and Hezbollah gunners. The Lebanese government and the United 
Nations have called the Israeli overflights a violation of Lebanese 
territory. Hezbollah, which is on the U.S. State Department list of 
terrorist organizations but is recognized in Lebanon as a resistance 
group, is known to possess thousands of inaccurate 127mm rockets with 
a range of up to 17 miles (27 kilometers). ^ (hd-pfg) &lt;

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday welcomed foreign ministers 
of the Rio Group to the Kremlin, saying that their visit should help 
bolster cooperation between Russia and Latin America. ``The Rio Group 
is one of the most representative and authoritative international 
organizations, and the most authoritative one in Latin America,'' 
Putin said at the start of talks with the Rio Group's troika, which 
is made up of the foreign ministers of Peru, Brazil and Costa Rica. 
He said that the troika's visit signalled ``the growing cooperation 
between Russia and Latin America.'' ``Our economic cooperation hasn't 
yet reached a high level, but we have been developing political dialogue 
and cooperation in confronting global challenges, such as terrorism,'' 
Putin said. ``I strongly hope that your visit to Moscow will give 
a strong impulse to the development of cooperation with the entire 
Latin America.'' Peru's Foreign Minister Allan Wagner said that the 
19-nation Rio Group was eager to develop closer ties with Russia. 
``We highly assess your government's initiative in holding this meeting,'' 
Wagner said, adding that the first political consultations between 
Russia and the Rio Group offer a ``historic opportunity.'' (vi/mb)

DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi 
women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq in an episode 
that threatened to unleash more resentment over war in Iraq. The U.S. 
military said the soldiers, increasingly anxious about the danger 
of suicide attacks, opened fire Monday when the driver of the van 
failed to stop as ordered. A Washington Post reporter at the scene 
said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including five young children. 
In the first moments after the shooting, an Army captain accused soldiers 
of not having fired warning shots quickly enough. The soldiers were 
from the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which lost four soldiers Saturday 
at another checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier posing as a taxi driver 
detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack. Elsewhere, the Central Command 
said, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's 
weapon while being questioned. The fatal shooting at the checkpoint 
happened along Route 9 near Najaf, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) 
north of the site of Saturday's suicide bombing. The Central Command 
said initial reports indicated the soldiers followed the rules of 
engagement to protect themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist attacks 
by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint 
to avoid the unnecessary loss of life,'' the statement said. Navy 
Capt. Frank Thorp, a U.S. Central Command spokesman in Doha, blamed 
the deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice 
of using women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing 
about this is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy 
of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us 
to be on our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' 
he said. ``So the blood of this incident is on the regime of Saddam 
Hussein.'' The shooting is likely to stoke opposition to the U.S.-led 
invasion among Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington 
had hoped for a popular uprising against Saddam and his Sunni Muslim 
regime. Instead, U.S. forces have faced stubborn resistance by Saddam's 
forces in Najaf and other southern Shiite strongholds. According to 
an account by the Central Command, the van approached the Army checkpoint 
Monday afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop but were 
ignored. They then fired warning shots but the vehicle kept moving 
toward the checkpoint. Troops then shot into its engine. As a last 
resort, the military said, soldiers fired into the passenger compartment. 
Two other civilians were wounded, according to the U.S. military, 
which said it is investigating the incident. ``They tried to warn 
the vehicle to stop; it did not stop,'' Marine Gen. Peter Pace said 
on U.S. television channel PBS. ``And it was unusual that that vehicle 
would be full of only women and that the driver was a woman. So we 
need to find out why it was that they were acting the way they did.'' 
The military statement said 13 women and children were in the van. 
But The Washington Post, whose reporter is with the 3rd Infantry, 
said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five 
children who appeared to be under 5. One of the wounded was a man 
not expected to live, the Post reported on its Web site. The newspaper 
described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the 
Iraqis' personal belongings. In its description of the shooting, the 
Post quoted a 3rd Infantry Division captain as saying the checkpoint 
crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough. The Post described 
the captain watching through binoculars and ordering the soldiers 
by radio to fire a warning shot first and then shoot a machine-gun 
round into the vehicle's radiator. When the vehicle kept coming, the 
captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About a dozen shots of 25 mm cannon 
fire were heard from one or more of the platoon's Bradley fighting 
vehicles, the Post said. The captain then shouted over the radio at 
the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] killed a family because 
you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' according to the Post. 
``It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope I never 
see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a medic, told the Post. U.S. 
medics evacuated survivors of the shooting, according to the Post. 
A woman who had superficial head wounds was flown by helicopter to 
a U.S. field hospital when it was learned she was pregnant, the Post 
said. U.S. officials offered the victims an unspecified amount of 
money to compensate them.

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he expects his 
agency's inspectors to return to Iraq after the war has ended. Mohamed 
ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said 
in a statement released to The Associated Press on Tuesday that the 
agency expected ``to go back with full authority after the cessation 
of hostilities.'' ``The IAEA mandate in Iraq is still valid and has 
not changed, and the IAEA is the sole body with legal authority to 
verify Iraq's nuclear disarmament,'' ElBaradei said. Inspections have 
underpinned international nonproliferation obligations for 30 years, 
he said. ``Only through impartial, international inspections can credibility 
be generated. Iraq is no exception to that requirement,'' he said. 
The agency's inspectors had ``made good progress'' since returning 
to Iraq in November after a four-year hiatus. The inspectors found 
no evidence Iraq held nuclear weapons, but agency officials have said 
more inspections were needed for a conclusive judgment. ``We stand 
ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume our work after 
the war and to provide the ongoing assurances sought by the Security 
Council, that Iraq has no nuclear weapons program,'' ElBaradei said.

Landslides triggered by flash floods in eastern Indonesia killed 27 
people, with at least five others reported missing, local officials 
and police said Tuesday. The floods swept away 17 houses on Flores 
island, 1,660 kilometers (1,030 miles) east of the capital of Jakarta, 
said Paulinus Domi, head of the local district of Ende. Police said 
they were searching for the missing late Tuesday in Ende. No other 
details were immediately available. Flooding and landslides have killed 
nearly 80 people on several Indonesian islands since the current rainy 
season began in late November. Many of the disasters have been blamed 
on deforestation caused by rampant illegal logging.

Ukrainian miners launched their third hunger strike in a month demanding 
the government pay millions of dollars in back wages, news reports 
said Tuesday. Twelve leaders of the Ukrainian Miners' Independent 
Trade Union in the coal-rich eastern Donbass region staged the strike 
in the head office of the Pavlohraduhol state holding company in Dnipropetrovsk, 
480 kilometer (300 miles) east of Kiev, the Interfax news agency reported. 
The miners are demanding some 65 million hryvna (US$12,264,000) in 
wages that have not been paid for several months, and higher monthly 
pay, Interfax quoted Mykola Voloshyn, deputy head of the union as 
saying. Fourteen miners ended their hunger strike at the Bendyuzka 
mine in the western Lviv region last month after the government promised 
to meet their demands. Meanwhile, one miner died after a layer of 
rock collapsed some 459 meters (1506 feet) underground Monday at the 
Bendyuzka mine in the western Lviv region, the Emergency Situations 
Ministry said in a statement. The cause of the accident is being investigated. 
Miners earn about 560 hryvna (US$105) monthly, and work in mines considered 
among the world's deadliest due to a high concentration of methane 
gas, insufficient funds to upgrade equipment and frequent safety violations. 
Some 60 miners have died in accidents this year; more than 3,700 have 
died since 1991. (am/tv/mb)

The coalition campaign in Iraq has reached a phase of ``steady advance,'' 
but more troops and civilians will die as fighting continues, Prime 
Minister Tony Blair's office said Tuesday. ``Now we are in the phase 
of steady advance and you saw signs of that steady advance yesterday, 
moving in on Basra, wearing down the opposition there and elsewhere, 
beginning the process of changing the military profile in those areas 
where we are in control,'' Blair's official spokesman said, briefing 
reporters on condition of anonymity. The spokesman said the decision 
by some British forces to switch from hard helmets to berets on Tuesday 
reflected growing confidence in their position. ``No one is under 
any illusions. There will be further difficulties, there will be further 
loss of life both to military personnel and, despite all the best 
efforts, of civilians, as we saw in the tragic incident at the checkpoint 
yesterday,'' the spokesman said, referring to the killing of seven 
Iraqi women and children by U.S. soldiers near Najaf. Earlier, a British 
minister said the checkpoint shooting was a tragedy, but doesn't compare 
with the deliberate killing of civilians by Iraqi forces. ``This is 
a tragedy that's happened as a result of the heat of war, as opposed 
to the callous murder and slaughter of the Iraqi people by Saddam 
Hussein,'' Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told Sky News television. 
British military officials and witnesses last Friday reported that 
Iraqi forces fired mortars and machine guns at around 1,000 Iraqi 
civilians trying to flee the southern city of Basra, which British 
troops have surrounded for more than a week. Many of the civilians 
were forced to retreat. One woman was reported badly injured by shrapnel, 
but there were no reports of civilian deaths in the incident. Britain 
has 45,000 personnel, including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led 
war on Iraq. Britain's Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed 
Monday in southern Iraq while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing 
the British death toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry 
said the soldier's family had been informed, but gave no further information.

SOUTH-CENTRAL IRAQ (AP) _ U.S. Marines waged a firefight against Iraqi 
forces Tuesday in and around the town of Diwaniyah and took at least 
20 prisoners, according to reports from the field. American warplanes 
also hammered defensive positions south of Baghdad overnight and dropped 
bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht and another ship in the southern 
port of Basra, Navy officials said. Around Diwaniyah, 120 kilometers 
(75 miles) southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Marines came under fire from 
artillery and mortars. Hundreds of Iraqi fighters with rocket-propelled 
grenades and rifles were said to be inside the town. Marine 155mm 
howitzers kilometers (miles) away opened fire on Iraqi mortar positions, 
tanks and bunkers. At least three Iraqis were wounded: Two very thin 
Iraqi soldiers who had been shot in the legs and were being treated 
with their hands bound behind their backs with silver duct tape; and 
an older man who had been shot in the back and leg. The Marines were 
guarding five men who had surrendered. There were no report of American 
casualties. Overnight, warplanes struck at Iraqi positions around 
Karbala and Hindiyah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) short of Baghdad, 
in a U.S. effort to open the way for the invasion of Baghdad by American 
forces massing outside the city. The bombing was in support of the 
Army's V Corps and hit surface-to-air missile sites and a bridge across 
the Euphrates River, said Lt. j.g. Nicole Kratzer, a spokeswoman for 
the air wing of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk. On Monday, Army 
forces fought pitched battles at Hindiyah against Republican Guards 
and other Iraqi loyalists. Battles were still raging on Tuesday further 
south in Nasiriyah, according to Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed 
Saeed al-Sahhaf. He told reporters in Baghdad that Fedayeen troops 
in the area had destroyed U.S. tanks and armored vehicles.

The government will be able to revoke British citizenship from immigrants 
who ``seriously prejudice'' the country's interest under new laws 
that came into force on Tuesday. There is speculation that the controversial 
legislation will be used against radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, 
with at least one Labor Party lawmaker calling for his expulsion from 
Britain. The change to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 
is part of a plan to stem the flow of asylum seekers into Britain 
and affects people with dual nationality. ``If we are to welcome those 
that aspire to and qualify for British citizenship, we must also ensure 
that those who acquire it by deception or prove to be abusing the 
privilege of that citizenship by acting against the U.K.'s vital interests 
are not able to retain it,'' Home Secretary David Blunkett said. ``That 
is why ... I will prepare a case to take action against anyone who 
has acted in a way which is totally incompatible with holding British 
citizenship.'' Labor lawmaker Andrew Dismore said that al-Masri, who 
has been banned from preaching by a government body at a mosque in 
north London because of his ``extreme and political'' statements, 
should be ``a prime candidate under these new powers, if not at the 
very top of the list.'' Home Office minister Beverley Hughes said 
in March that Hamza was ``being very, very closely monitored.'' The 
Egyptian-born activist, 44, has condemned the invasion of Iraq as 
a ``war against Islam,'' and claimed the Sept. 11 attacks on the United 
States were a Jewish plot. He has also told worshippers that the Space 
Shuttle Columbia was destroyed by God because it was carrying an Israeli 
Jew, American Christians and an Indian-born Hindu. ``He wants to turn 
Britain into a Taliban-style state and has no place in this country,'' 
said Dismore. ``He fulfills the criteria of this legislation for his 
nationality to be removed and then for him to be removed.'' The United 
States says al-Masri is a member of the Islamic Army of Aden, the 
organization that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing of 
the USS Cole off Yemen. The cleric is wanted in Yemen for allegedly 
orchestrating terrorist activities there, but as a British citizen 
is protected from extradition. Hamza came to Britain in 1980 and was 
granted British citizenship after marrying English national Valerie 
Traverso. If the authorities decide to take action, he will have the 
right to appeal. Other measures that came into effect on Tuesday are 
designed to stop failed asylum seekers delaying their removal from 
Britain by ``abusing'' the appeal system. They also crack down on 
illegal working by giving immigration officers new powers to enter 
and search business premises. Asylum applications in Britain reached 
record levels last year and the government has pledged to cut the 
numbers in half within seven months. The Home Office has said 110,700 
people sought refugee status in Britain in 2002, a 20 percent rise 
on the previous year. Asylum seekers from Iraq and Zimbabwe accounted 
for nearly all the increase. (jw-mm)

Four Russian soldiers were killed and one wounded in a mine explosion 
Tuesday in Ingushetia, the Russian republic bordering Chechnya, the 
Russian Defense Ministry said. A reconnaissance unit was sweeping 
a road near the Ingush village of Ali-Yurt along the route of an army 
convoy when one of its dogs discovered a mine, the Interfax news agency 
reported, quoting a ministry spokesman. When a team of sappers approached 
the explosive device, it detonated, killing four soldiers and injuring 
another, the report said. Mine explosions are a common feature of 
the war in Chechnya, where rebels routinely lay explosive devices 
along the routes of military convoys. The mines claim daily casualties 
and force Russian troops to conduct painstaking sweeps ahead of any 
vehicles. Ingushetia has absorbed thousands of refugees from the war 
in Chechnya, but has largely avoided spillover violence from the conflict 
next door. (ee/mb)

A 72-year-old man who fell ill after returning from the Far East is 
suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hospital said 
Tuesday, confirming the fourth case in Germany so far. The patient 
has largely recovered and does not appear to have infected others, 
according to the clinic near the western city of Dortmund where he 
is being treated. The man was one of several patients put into isolation 
wards in Germany to guard against a spread of the mystery illness 
that has infected some 1,600 people worldwide, mostly in Asia, killing 
more than 60. Tests at a laboratory in Hamburg confirmed that the 
man, who was not identified, was suffering from the virus after returning 
from a trip to Singapore and Vietnam, the hospital said. Three patients 
from Singapore being treated for SARS at a Frankfurt clinic since 
March 15 also are expected to make a full recovery, doctors said last 
week. The three, including a doctor who had treated SARS patients 
in Singapore, were taken off a New York-Singapore flight in Frankfurt. 
German authorities also are carrying out tests on a 62-year-old man 
suspected of having contracted the illness on a trip to China and 
Hong Kong. The patient is under quarantine at a Munich hospital. Tests 
have shown several other suspected cases in Germany to be false alarms.

Fearful that the isolation of 240 people in a Hong Kong building has 
not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials said 
Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. Residents 
of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved 
Tuesday night to camps used for holidays, one in the suburban New 
Territories and one on Hong Kong island, said Dr. Leung Pak-yin, deputy 
director of health. Leung said an ``environmental factor'' in the 
sealed-off building might be causing the disease to spread, but he 
did not elaborate in an evening statement he read out to reporters. 
There has been speculation a sewage leak might have spread the disease 
among residents of apartment units at one end of the 33-story building. 
Leung said health officials were still investigating but he did not 
take questions. The health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, was to hold 
a news conference later Tuesday night. Hong Kong officials said Tuesday 
an additional 75 people were hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
or SARS, including 52 from the Amoy Gardens complex. It was not immediately 
clear how many of the new cases had come from Block E, which was sealed 
off Monday with barricades and police tape. Residents were told Monday 
they would have to stay inside for 10 days, with regular medical checkups 
and three free meals a day provided. They will get the same in the 
quarantine camps, Leung said, but it was not immediately clear what 
their living conditions will be like. Authorities had said previously 
that some 200 people were infected at Amoy Gardens, about half of 
them from the building that was sealed off. There was no updated figure 
for Amoy Gardens cases by late Tuesday. Hong Kong on Tuesday night 
reported another death of SARS patient, for 16 total here and at least 
63 worldwide. Out of more than 1,600 SARS cases globally, 685 have 
been in Hong Kong. Separately, the Health Department said Tuesday 
a 30-year-old man with SARS symptoms had flown here from Bangkok aboard 
Thai Airways Flight TG606, and they wanted to locate all other passengers. 
The man became sick while he was staying in the Thai capital from 
March 25 to Saturday, but health officials in Hong Kong said they 
did not immediately know his nationality or where he contracted his 
illness. Global health officials say they have been worried by the 
spread of the illness by air travelers _ which is apparently how it 
moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, Canada and Vietnam, all of which 
have suffered deaths. Hong Kong officials said earlier Tuesday that 
four recreational activity camps could be turned into quarantine centers 
for 1,000 people, but they were only sending the people from Amoy 
Gardens to two of them.

Political parties on Tuesday agreed on a consensus candidate to become 
mayor of Belgium's second largest city after a corruption scandal 
forced the whole Antwerp city government to step down last month. 
Patrick Janssens, who stepped down as leader of the governing Dutch-speaking 
Socialist party to become mayor, has received the backing of the VLD 
liberal party, which had pushed its own candidate until Monday. Under 
the agreement to keep the Socialists in charge of city hall, the VLD 
won more power over the city's law and order department and won assurances 
a crisis manager will be appointed to revamp the city administration. 
Janssens will assemble his executive over the coming days before he 
can be sworn in as new mayor. Over the past month, a corruption scandal 
undermined the port city's government and was highlighted when Socialist 
mayor Leona Detiege and her 10-member council stepped down when it 
became clear they had spent thousands of taxpayers euros (dollars) 
on clothing, shoes, birth announcements, glasses and other personal 
items. Accusations further centered on alleged corruption involving 
a city government contract for street advertising. On top of that, 
the city's police chief was charged with embezzlement and forgery. 
The scandal comes a month ahead of general elections, in which this 
port city of 500,000 will be a focal point since the extreme right 
wing party Vlaams Blok is the city's biggest. The party, forced into 
opposition by the other main parties, is the only one not involved 
in the scandal. Vlaams Blok leader Filip De Winter has asked for a 
government-appointed commissioner to be appointed to lead the city 
until elections. ^ rac/cb &lt;

The European Union head office on Tuesday called the killing of at 
least seven Iraqi women and children by U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint

Archaeologists have uncovered a broken pillar with a carving of a 
lotus flower at the site of a destroyed 16th century mosque claimed 
by both Hindus and Muslims, a government official said Tuesday. The 
underground discovery could bring them closer to solving the mystery 
of whether a mosque or temple first existed at the site, a government 
official said Tuesday. ``The finding of a pillar and a multilayered 
flooring suggests there exists a permanent structure beneath the soil,'' 
said R.M. Srivastava, the senior government administrator in the northern 
town of Ayodhya, where the site is located. ``At this point we can 
only say that remains of a permanent structure lay buried in the soil. 
It could be anything _ a temple, a mosque or even a kitchen structure,'' 
Srivastava told The Associated Press by telephone. The broken pillar 
has a lotus embedded on top, he said. The Babri Mosque was demolished 
by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, provoking nationwide riots that killed 
more than 2,000 people. Both Hindus and Muslims claim ownership of 
the religious site in Ayodhya, nearly 550 kilometers (345 miles) east 
of New Delhi. Hindus claim it was the birthplace of their chief God, 
Rama, and they want to build a temple on the site in his honor. Hindu 
hard-liners also say that a Mogul emperor had built the mosque after 
demolishing a Hindu temple, a claim for which the Muslims say there 
is no proof. The Allahabad High Court in Lucknow, the capital of northern 
Uttar Pradesh state, is recording evidence in the title dispute. Earlier 
this month, the court asked government archaeologists to excavate 
and report within a month whether ruins of an ancient Hindu structure 
lie beneath the site of the demolished mosque. India's Supreme Court 
on Monday rejected a government plea to lift a ban on Hindu religious 
activity near the site of the Babri Mosque. The court said the government 
must wait for the Allahabad High Court to rule on whether Hindus or 
Muslims have a right to the land in Ayodhya.

Leaders of seven small EU nations meet Tuesday looking for common 
ground in efforts to thwart plans by larger members to boost their 
powers through a European Union constitution now being drafted. The 
gathering of the leaders from Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, 
Finland, Ireland, Portugal and Belgium points to what may be a contentious 
debate on how the EU _ which will absorb 10 new members in 2004 _ 
is to be run in the future. Derisively termed ``the Seven Dwarfs'' 
in German media this week, the seven small EU members have traditionally 
had equal standing alongside Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy and France, 
thanks mostly to veto rights enabling even the smallest member to 
block a decision in key policy-making areas. But proposed reforms, 
now being debated by the 105-member European Convention that is drafting 
an EU constitution, could end vetoes, effectively giving larger countries 
a bigger say ahead in an EU of 25 or more members. On top of that, 
France and Germany are lobbying for a full-time EU president who would 
serve a five-year term and have the job of making the EU more effective 
and more visible on the world stage. This new position would replace 
the long-standing practice of rotating the EU presidency among all 
member governments every six months. Small EU nations fear ending 
the rotation system will reduce their influence in shaping EU policy 
and leave them sidelined. The European Convention is debating, in 
particular, the abolition of vetoes in such sensitive matters as EU 
farm reforms and foreign policy. Under the chairmanship of former 
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, it is also defining what 
powers should remain the preserve of national governments, and which 
should be become exercised at the EU level. Small nations want to 
keep a hand in such matters as trade and foreign affairs. They generally 
favor a strong European Commission, the executive at the heart of 
the union which drafts and monitors compliance with EU legislation 
and acts as a guardian of sorts over the rights of small EU members. 
Ahead of the meeting, it was unclear if the seven could forge a coalition. 
The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg generally hope to see an EU 
with strong centralized powers. Ireland and Finland oppose such federalist 
visions, preferring to have more powers on national level. The debate 
on revamping the EU powers and institutions began in February, 2002, 
amid great hopes of settling long-standing arguments over how to give 
the union more teeth and make it more effective all around. EU nations 
have been at odds for two decades over to forge a common foreign and 
security policies. The U.S.-led war in Iraq has complicated that debate, 
sowing European divisions at a moment when convention members are 
trying to write constitutional articles on an EU foreign policy. Giscard 
d'Estaing has hinted he would like more time to complete the constitution, 
which is supposed to be adopted by the governments of all 15 members 
by the end of the year. He plans to meet with the EU leaders at a 
mid-April summit in Athens during which the 10 candidate nations are 
scheduled to sign their accession treaties. In the Iraq crisis, France 
and Germany have led the anti-war camp, while Britain, Spain, Portugal, 
Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have generally sided with the United 
States. (cb/rw)

A square in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin has been named after 
an Iraqi suicide bomber who killed four U.S. troops over the weekend, 
camp officials said Tuesday. The naming of the square is part of weeklong 
anniversary commemorations of an 11-day battle between Israeli troops 
and about 150 gunmen in the camp in April 2002 _ one of the toughest 
in 30 months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting. Fifty-two Palestinians 
and 23 Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting that left large 
patches of the Jenin camp in ruins. On Monday, a small square in the 
camp was named after Ali Joafar al-Noamani, a non-commissioned Iraqi 
officer who blew himself up at a U.S. checkpoint in southern Iraq 
on Saturday, killing for U.S. troops. The bombing symbolizes the close 
ties between Iraqis and Palestinians, said Akram Abu Esbaa, organizer 
of the commemorations. ````We are experiencing the same tragedy here 
in Palestine that they are in Baghdad,'' he said. As part of anniversary 
events, camp residents will march in support of Iraq on Thursday and 
plan prayers are planned in a demolished section of the camp on Friday 
in honor of the Iraqi dead. Residents also hope to collect 10,000 
pints of blood, to be delivered to Iraq through the Red Crescent Society, 
camp officials said. By Tuesday, they had collected hundreds of pints 
ready for shipment. In Gaza City, about 700 Palestinians marched in 
support of Iraq, carrying Iraqi flags, posters of Saddam Hussein and 
banners reading ``No Blood for Oil.'' ^ hf-kl &lt;

Libya began airlifting relief supplies to Iraq via Syria Tuesday to 
help people affected by the U.S.-led war on Iraq, the Libyan Embassy 
said. The first plane carrying 40 tons of food and medical supplies 
arrived at Damascus Airport early Monday, one of 15 shipments expected 
to arrive in Syria within the next week. The relief supplies were 
``a gift from the Libyan people to the Iraqi people,'' the Libyan 
statement said. It said the supplies will be loaded onto trucks at 
Damascus Airport and shipped overland to Iraq. It did not elaborate. 
Libya, like most Arab countries, opposes the U.S. and British military 
campaign against Iraq. ^ (zk-pfg) &lt;

India and Vietnam are seeking ways to bolster their bilateral trade, 
which now amounts to US$370 million a year, the Vietnamese foreign 
minister said Tuesday. Speaking to Indian business leaders, visiting 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Dy Nien said India should fully tap into Vietnam's 
market of 80 million consumers and treat his country as a gateway 
to Southeast Asia and East Asia. Indian investment in Vietnam totaled 
US$125 million last year, mainly in sugar production, electric power 
generation, edible oil and plastics. Nien said some of the ways of 
boosting bilateral trade that the two nations were considering included 
extending credit to exporters, establishing quicker payment mechanisms, 
and jointly promoting trade. Vietnam is a member of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, which is seeking to forge a 
free-trade zone with India similar to the one being planned with China. 
Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand are the other ASEAN members. India's exports 
to ASEAN nations totaled US$3.2 billion in 2001-2002, while ASEAN 
member countries shipped around US$6 billion in exports to India, 
international consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. said in a recent 
study. On Monday, Nien met India's President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and 
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and presided over an India-Vietnam 
Joint Commission meeting with his Indian counterpart, Yashwant Sinha. 
Nien arrived in India Sunday and was scheduled to leave later Tuesday.

DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi 
women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq in an episode 
that threatened to unleash more resentment over war in Iraq. The U.S. 
military said the soldiers, increasingly anxious about the danger 
of suicide attacks, opened fire Monday when the driver of the van 
failed to stop as ordered. A Washington Post reporter at the scene 
said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including five young children. 
In the first moments after the shooting, an Army captain accused soldiers 
of not having fired warning shots quickly enough. The soldiers were 
from the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which lost four soldiers Saturday 
at another checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier posing as a taxi driver 
detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack. In a similar incident, another 
Iraqi was killed at a checkpoint near the south-central town of Shatra, 
according to U.S. Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. Elsewhere, the Central Command 
said, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's 
weapon while being questioned. The fatal shooting of the seven women 
and children happened along Route 9 near Najaf, about 32 kilometers 
(20 miles) north of the site of Saturday's suicide bombing. The Central 
Command said initial reports indicated the soldiers followed the rules 
of engagement to protect themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist 
attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint 
to avoid the unnecessary loss of life,'' the statement said. Navy 
Capt. Frank Thorp, a U.S. Central Command spokesman in Doha, blamed 
the deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice 
of using women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing 
about this is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy 
of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us 
to be on our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' 
he said. ``So the blood of this incident is on the regime of Saddam 
Hussein.'' The shooting is likely to stoke opposition to the U.S.-led 
invasion among Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington 
had hoped for a popular uprising against Saddam and his Sunni Muslim 
regime. Instead, U.S. forces have faced stubborn resistance by Saddam's 
forces in Najaf and other southern Shiite strongholds. According to 
an account by the Central Command, the van approached the Army checkpoint 
Monday afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop but were 
ignored. They then fired warning shots but the vehicle kept moving 
toward the checkpoint. Troops then shot into its engine. As a last 
resort, the military said, soldiers fired into the passenger compartment. 
Two other civilians were wounded, according to the U.S. military, 
which said it is investigating the incident. ``They tried to warn 
the vehicle to stop; it did not stop,'' Marine Gen. Peter Pace said 
on U.S. television channel PBS. ``And it was unusual that that vehicle 
would be full of only women and that the driver was a woman. So we 
need to find out why it was that they were acting the way they did.'' 
The military statement said 13 women and children were in the van. 
But The Washington Post, whose reporter is with the 3rd Infantry, 
said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five 
children who appeared to be under 5. One of the wounded was a man 
not expected to live, the Post reported on its Web site. The newspaper 
described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive Toyota crammed with the 
Iraqis' personal belongings. In its description of the shooting, the 
Post quoted a 3rd Infantry Division captain as saying the checkpoint 
crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough. The Post described 
the captain watching through binoculars and ordering the soldiers 
by radio to fire a warning shot first and then shoot a machine-gun 
round into the vehicle's radiator. When the vehicle kept coming, the 
captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About a dozen shots of 25 mm cannon 
fire were heard from one or more of the platoon's Bradley fighting 
vehicles, the Post said. The captain then shouted over the radio at 
the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] killed a family because 
you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' according to the Post. 
``It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope I never 
see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a medic, told the Post. U.S. 
medics evacuated survivors of the shooting, according to the Post. 
A woman who had superficial head wounds was flown by helicopter to 
a U.S. field hospital when it was learned she was pregnant, the Post 
said. U.S. officials offered the victims an unspecified amount of 
money to compensate them. The European Union head office on Tuesday 
called the killing ``a horrible tragedy'' and urged forces on both 
sides of the war to spare civilian lives.

CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's new military commander in Europe outlined 
his vision Tuesday of an alliance transformed to tackle 21st-century 
threats of terrorism and instability, if political leaders can agree 
on how to use it. U.S. Marine Gen. James L. Jones told reporters first 
elements of NATO's rapid reaction force should be operational this 
year. It would eventually be able to deploy thousands of troops to 
trouble spots around the world. ``We are seeing a military metamorphosis 
of the alliance,'' said Jones, who took up his NATO post Jan. 17. 
``If the nations wish to have a force that has an out-of-area capability, 
beyond a regional capability, we could build that.'' Jones' comments 
came as NATO diplomats in Brussels embark on tentative discussions 
on a possible alliance role in peacekeeping in Afghanistan, or even 
postwar Iraq. Although divisions over Iraq have plunged NATO into 
a deep crisis, diplomats at alliance headquarters in the Belgian capital 
are sounding out support for a role in peacekeeping or nation-building 
after the fighting. The United States last year proposed NATO take 
on such a role, but the plan was shelved in the face of opposition 
from France, Germany and Belgium. Diplomats say informal talks have 
resumed on the plan that would build on NATO's experience peacekeeping 
in Bosnia and Kosovo. NATO officials said it was too early to see 
if a consensus could be found among the 19 allies. France and Belgium 
have expressed doubts about a proposal for the alliance to take over 
command of the peacekeeping operation in the Afghan capital Kabul, 
which is currently being led by German troops. Diplomats from other 
countries were still hopeful a solution could be found that would 
give the alliance a greater role there. Jones said he had received 
no orders to prepare for NATO operations in either Afghanistan or 
Iraq, but he highlighted the debate within the alliance over a possible 
role, well beyond its traditional Euro-Atlantic theater. Speaking 
at alliance military headquarters in southern Belgium, he said plans 
for the proposed NATO reaction force of 20,000-strong rapidly deployable, 
air, land and sea units could be realized without major new spending 
by the allies. ``So much of the money that we need can be done through 
some in-depth reforms,'' he said. ``My goal is to build or the NATO 
reaction force from existing capacities without asking for more money.''

Etched in Zackie Achmat's memory are the last choking grunts of a 
friend dying of AIDS, a disease he will likely die of if he doesn't 
take antiretroviral drugs. Achmat perhaps the most outspoken leader 
of a civil disobedience campaign that seeks to force the government 
to supply the drugs. He vowed Tuesday to intensify the fight. The 
HIV-positive law student reiterated his vow never to take the drugs 
until the government makes them generally available. Diagnosed in 
1990, Achmat, 41, is leading a new wave of activism to help South 
Africa's 4.7 million HIV infected people _ one in 9 _ get AIDS drugs, 
even at the cost of his own life. His medical insurance will pay for 
antiretrovirals, but he will not take them till they are available 
to the general population. His commitment caught the attention of 
former President Nelson Mandela last year who visited Achmat at his 
home. Praising him as a role model and disciplined member of the ruling 
African National Congress, Mandela vowed to take his fight to government. 
Achmat believes the former president is ``doing all he can.'' This 
is not Achmat's first battle with the South African state. As a young 
anti-apartheid activist, he was detained without trial five times. 
Still an ANC member, he is taking on the very people he stood should 
to shoulder with during the struggle. His group, the Treatment Action 
Campaign has chosen civil disobedience, a popular anti-apartheid weapon, 
to pressure the government. The TAC has grown into a mass movement, 
from a small group that began smuggling generic drugs into the country 
three years go to help fight opportunistic infections. It won a groundbreaking 
case last year when the Constitutional Court ordered the government 
to supply antiretroviral drugs to public hospitals and clinics. Negotiations 
between government, labor and concerned organizations on how to effect 
the court ruling, ground to a halt, fueling the fire of frustration 
and giving birth to the civil disobedience campaign. Soon after a 
fiery confrontation last week when Achmat verbally abused the health 
minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, the government indicated a 
desire to resume talks. Achmat and about 160 activists waved placards 
and chanted, ``murderer'' and ``Manto go to jail'' as she tried to 
address a public health conference. He later apologized for the outburst 
but added: ``I can't apologize for calling her a murderer because 
it is an uncomfortable fact that can be substantiated.'' The TAC claims 
government inaction leads to about 600 AIDS-related deaths a day. 
Last month, Achmat and hundreds of activists kicked off their civil 
disobedience campaign by filing manslaughter charges against the minister 
and her Trade and Industry counterpart, Alec Erwin. Tshabalala-Msimang 
condemned Achmat's behavior but recognized his right to protest. ``Through 
its disobedience campaign, the TAC spreads malicious lies that government 
'had the resources to take action to reduce the prices of HIV/AIDS 
medicines' but had failed to do so,'' she said. ``This year government 
will move swiftly into implementing the Medicine and Related Substances 
Control Amendment Act to give our country better options in accessing 
affordable quality medicines,'' she added. Meanwhile, Achmat said 
he is sick of ``begging, cajoling, charming and arguing before government'' 
while his friends die. ``I am taking vitamins, antidepressants, TB 
prophylactics and nutrients ... but I need antiretrovirals now,'' 
he said. Since August 2002 Achmat has had two chest infections, peripheral 
neuropathy _ a degenerative nerve disorder _ chronic sinusitis and 
recurrent thrush. He draws strength from the dedication of fellow 
activists and their belief that like the anti-apartheid heroes who 
came before them, they will triumph. ``TAC will win because we act 
in good faith. We will sit down with government for as long as it 
takes,'' Achmat said. ^ (es-sv)

News flash: U.S. President W. George Bush and Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein give historic hug marking the end of the war! Another flash: 
Pakistan's president to visit New Delhi and meet Indian PM after ban 
on air travel between hostile neighbors lifted. If only. The Times 
of India used April Fool's Day to take jabs at Bush, Indian Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistani President Gen. Pervez 
Musharraf. The phony picture of Bush and Saddam showed a man releasing 
a peace dove with a huge fireball providing the backdrop. Scoops in 
the pullout also included fictionalized items about Australian cricket 
stars flunking drug tests and forfeiting the World Cup title to India; 
and pollution levels in the capital dropping to near-zero levels. 
The Musharraf blurb comes at a time when relations between the nuclear 
rivals have touched a new low with travel links severed between them 
since last January and no government-level talks since Musharraf visited 
India in 2001. ``Musharraf is scheduled to attend a large luncheon 
hosted by Indian President Kalam at Ashoka Hotel,'' read the phony 
snippet on the front of its entertainment section. ``According to 
sources, the PM is keen to host a more intimate dinner for Musharraf 
and his wife.''

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he expects his 
agency's inspectors to return to Iraq after the war has ended. Mohamed 
ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said 
in a statement released to The Associated Press that the agency expected 
``to go back with full authority after the cessation of hostilities.'' 
``The IAEA mandate in Iraq is still valid and has not changed, and 
the IAEA is the sole body with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear 
disarmament,'' ElBaradei said. Inspections have underpinned international 
nonproliferation obligations for 30 years, he said. ``Only through 
impartial, international inspections can credibility be generated. 
Iraq is no exception to that requirement,'' he said. The agency's 
inspectors had made ``good progress'' since returning to Iraq in November 
after a four-year hiatus. The inspectors found no evidence Iraq held 
nuclear weapons, but agency officials have said more inspections were 
needed for a conclusive judgment. ``We stand ready, subject to Security 
Council guidance, to resume our work after the war and to provide 
the ongoing assurances sought by the Security Council, that Iraq has 
no nuclear weapons program,'' ElBaradei said. (sl/rp/swg)

American soldiers on the road to Baghdad fought bloody street-to-street 
battles with Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein while tense troops 
in southern Iraq shot and killed seven women and children when the 
driver of a van failed to stop at a checkpoint. The civilian deaths, 
following days of ambush attacks, may damage coalition efforts to 
win over the Iraqi people. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early 
Tuesday toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala 
to the southwest, and circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. 
Buildings in the capital shuddered in some of the strongest blasts 
since the air war began March 20. The night sky glowed orange and 
smoke billowed from the Old Palace presidential compound. Rumbling 
explosions could be heard throughout the morning. Among the targets, 
U.S. officials said allied planes struck a complex that serves as 
the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents 
say Saddam's son Odai runs a torture center. Information Minister 
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said five people were killed and 25 others 
wounded in bombing in Baghdad Tuesday morning alone. U.S.-led troops 
have relentlessly targeted Republican Guard positions in and around 
Baghdad in preparation for the war's likely decisive battle. U.S. 
forces battled some of these fighters from Iraq's best-trained units 
Monday in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah, about 50 miles (80 
kilometers) south of Baghdad. Troops seized tons of ammunition and 
hundreds of weapons at the local headquarters of Saddam's Baath Party, 
along with maps showing Iraqi military positions and the expected 
route of the U.S. attack. To the south, Marines traded fire Tuesday 
with hundreds of Iraqi fighters in the town of Diwaniyah. Other units 
fought to isolate Najaf in an ongoing effort to protect U.S. supply 
lines. A series of ruse attacks by militants in civilian clothes _ 
including a suicide bombing that killed four soldiers over the weekend 
_ have made the trek north increasingly dangerous for coalition troops. 
Monday's fatal shooting happened at a U.S. Army checkpoint near Najaf, 
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Saturday's suicide attack. 
Coalition officials said soldiers motioned for an approaching van 
to stop, but the driver ignored them. Troops fired warning shots, 
to no avail, before shooting into the engine, then into the passenger 
compartment as a last resort, according to a statement from U.S. Central 
Command, which oversees the war in Iraq. The van was carrying 13 women 
and children, and seven were killed, the statement said. But The Washington 
Post, whose reporter is traveling with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, 
said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five 
small children. The newspaper described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive 
crammed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. In its account of the 
shooting, the Post quoted an Army captain as saying the checkpoint 
crew did not fire the warning shots quickly enough. Central Command 
said initial reports indicated the soldiers had acted properly. A 
spokesman blamed the deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics 
and its practice of using women and children as shields. ``The most 
horrendous thing about this is that this is the result of what is 
apparently the strategy of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, 
which has caused us to be on our toes and ensure that these are not 
suicide bombers,'' said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. ``So the blood of 
this incident is on the regime of Saddam Hussein.'' Thorp said another 
Iraqi was killed Tuesday in a similar incident, at a checkpoint near 
the south-central town of Shatra. U.S.-led troops moving north toward 
Baghdad have focused much of their energy on rooting out fighters 
with the ruling Baath Party militia and the Fedayeen _ Saddam's most 
trusted paramilitary militia. But they have also distributed rations 
to civilians, and they say winning over the Iraqi people is a priority. 
In Diwaniyah, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad, 
Marines fought with hundreds of Iraqi fighters who fired on them from 
inside buildings. At least 20 Iraqis were taken prisoner. Some simply 
surrendered. Meanwhile, Iraq publicly denied a report that Saddam's 
family had fled the country. A statement on Iraqi TV called the report 
``a rumor circulated by the U.S. Defense Department.'' Iraqi TV late 
Monday aired footage of Saddam and his sons Odai and Qusai, but there 
was no way of determining when the video was shot. Gen. Peter Pace, 
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. intelligence 
sources have been unable to confirm that Saddam survived the March 
19 strike on a bunker where he was believed to be staying but said, 
``That doesn't mean he's dead.'' U.S. President George W. Bush warned 
Monday that Saddam ``may try to bring terror to our shores.'' The 
United States is acting to prevent such threats, he said, while offering 
assurances that the war remains on track. In northern Iraq, commanders 
said forces searching the recently captured compound of Muslim extremist 
group Ansar al-Islam found documents, computer discs and other material 
belonging to Arab fighters _ including suspected militants living 
in the United States. The Bush administration has longed claimed Ansar 
is linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network, but there has been no 
indication it has ties to Saddam's regime. Elsewhere, an Iraqi prisoner 
was shot to death after he reached for a Marine's weapon while being 
questioned, Central Command spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Charles Owen said 
Tuesday. Near the southern port of Basra, warplanes from the aircraft 
carrier USS Kitty Hawk dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht 
and another ship, Navy officials said Tuesday. The official casualty 
count for Americans stands at 44 dead, seven captured and 16 missing. 
The British death toll rose to 26 with the death of a soldier Monday 
in southern Iraq. Iraqi officials have given no estimate of military 
casualties but have said at least 430 civilians have been killed and 
thousands wounded. British officials say 8,000 Iraqis have been taken 
prisoner so far.

The Atlanta Thrashers helped halt the Rangers' push to make the playoffs 
_ again. Yannick Tremblay scored a power-play goal at 2:40 of overtime 
Monday night to lift the Thrashers to a 4-3 victory over New York, 
improving to 4-0-0 against the Rangers this season. ``We had a lot 
of opportunities to win the game,'' Rangers captain Mark Messier said. 
We threw a lot at them and should have been able to bury a few more 
chances.'' The big-spending Rangers trail the New York Islanders by 
three points with three games to play in the race for the final playoff 
spot in the Eastern Conference. The teams play Tuesday night on Long 
Island, and an Islanders victory would eliminate the Rangers from 
playoff contention. ``We were just trying to knock the Rangers off,'' 
Atlanta's Marc Savard said. ``Tonight, we did it.'' Messier's 18th 
goal was one of three in the third period that enabled the Rangers 
to overcome a 2-0 deficit after two periods and force overtime, but 
Atlanta maintained its poise. ``The Rangers really came back in the 
third period and had shots down low,'' said Bob Hartley, who has coached 
Atlanta to a 17-13-5-1 record since taking over Jan. 14th. ``It's 
one of those games you would say is a character game for your team,'' 
Hartley said. ``It's a good learning experience when you're up two-zip 
after two. We knew the Rangers would come out real desperate and that 
they would throw everything at us. You have to give them credit. They 
came right back and fought.'' The Rangers began the third-period comeback 
with Boris Mironov's sixth of the season at 1:05. Messier's goal at 
2:53 tied the score 2-2. After Savard netted his second of the game 
and 17th of the season on a power play at 15:28, Petr Nedved tied 
it at 3-3 with his 26th at 16:19. With New York's Eric Lindros in 
the penalty box for high-sticking during the overtime, Tremblay scored 
his seventh of the season with a shot from the slot that beat Mike 
Dunham. ``Right at the end we were able to control the puck pretty 
good and move the puck around,'' Tremblay said. ``We wanted to play 
like we were battling for a playoff spot.'' Atlanta tied the franchise's 
best unbeaten streak at four (3-0-1). Savard extended his scoring 
streak to six games (five goals, six assists), matching his season 
high. Dany Heatley had three assists to extend his point streak to 
four games (three goals, seven assists). Heatley has 32 points (14 
goals, 18 assists) in his past 24 games. Linemate Vyacheslav Kozlov 
also scored a goal and added three assists. &lt;

American soldiers on the road to Baghdad fought bloody street-to-street 
battles with Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein while tense troops 
in southern Iraq shot and killed seven women and children when the 
driver of a van failed to stop at a checkpoint. The civilian deaths, 
following days of ambush attacks, may damage coalition efforts to 
win over the Iraqi people. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early 
Tuesday toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala 
to the southwest, and circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. 
Buildings in the capital shuddered in some of the strongest blasts 
since the air war began March 20. The night sky glowed orange and 
smoke billowed from the Old Palace presidential compound. Rumbling 
explosions could be heard throughout the morning. Among the targets, 
U.S. officials said allied planes struck a complex that serves as 
the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents 
say Saddam's son Odai runs a torture center. Information Minister 
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said five people were killed and 25 others 
wounded in bombing in Baghdad Tuesday morning alone. U.S.-led troops 
have relentlessly targeted Republican Guard positions in and around 
Baghdad in preparation for the war's likely decisive battle. U.S. 
forces battled some of these fighters from Iraq's best-trained units 
Monday in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah, about 50 miles (80 
kilometers) south of Baghdad. Troops seized tons of ammunition and 
hundreds of weapons at the local headquarters of Saddam's Baath Party, 
along with maps showing Iraqi military positions and the expected 
route of the U.S. attack. To the south, Marines traded fire Tuesday 
with hundreds of Iraqi fighters in the town of Diwaniyah. Other units 
fought to isolate Najaf in an ongoing effort to protect U.S. supply 
lines. A series of ruse attacks by militants in civilian clothes _ 
including a suicide bombing that killed four soldiers over the weekend 
_ have made the trek north increasingly dangerous for coalition troops. 
Monday's fatal shooting happened at a U.S. Army checkpoint near Najaf, 
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Saturday's suicide attack. 
Coalition officials said soldiers motioned for an approaching van 
to stop, but the driver ignored them. Troops fired warning shots, 
to no avail, before shooting into the engine, then into the passenger 
compartment as a last resort, according to a statement from U.S. Central 
Command, which oversees the war in Iraq. The van was carrying 13 women 
and children, and seven were killed, the statement said. But The Washington 
Post, whose reporter is traveling with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, 
said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 were killed, including five 
small children. The newspaper described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive

Tests on a reactor at the troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin 
near the border with Austria have caused an unexpected shutdown, an 
official said Tuesday. Plant spokesman Milan Nebesar said the reactor 
of the plant's second unit automatically shut down Monday during tests 
in which workers cut off steam supply into the turbine. ``We were 
testing the response of the control system,'' Nebesar said, adding 
the shutdown of the reactor was unexpected. ``A drop in the reactor's 
output under 40 percent of its capacity would have been enough'' during 
the tests, rather than shutting down completely, Nebesar said. He 
said the reactor would be restarted later in the day. The reactor 
was shut down already on March 6 after a minor leak was detected in 
a steam pipeline, just four days after workers started testing the 
reactor of the plant's second unit at full capacity. It was then restarted 
on Thursday last week. The 1,000-megawatt unit is scheduled for commercial 
use by the beginning of 2004. The plant, based on Russian design and 
upgraded with U.S. technology, has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear 
malfunctions since testing began in November 2000. Located just 60 
kilometers (35 miles) north of the Austrian border, it has been a 
source of friction between the two countries. Critics in non-nuclear 
Austria argue the plant is unsafe and demand that it be shut down, 
but Czech authorities insist the plant is safe. The plant's other 
1,000-megawatt unit, currently shut down for two months during planned 
maintenance, has already entered the last stage of tests and should 
be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003. (nr/rp)

Manchester United on Tuesday reported a 34 percent fall in profits 
but an overall improvement in its financial picture. Pre-tax profits 
in the six months ending Jan. 31 were reported at 20.3 million pounds 
(US$32.1 million), a decrease from the same period the previous year 
when the club sold Jaap Stam and Andy Cole for 16.3 million pounds 
(US$25.5 million). The world's richest soccer club said sales in the 
six-month period rose 13 percent to 92.6 million pounds (US$146.3 
million). Operating profits before player sales increased 32 percent 
to 31.1 million pounds (US$49.1 million). Manchester United said its 
salary bill for the the period was 39.7 million (US$52.7 million), 
43 percent of sales. It said that was within the target of 50 percent. 
The club said it expected its wage bill to reach 50 percent at the 
end of the next reporting period. Chief executive Peter Kenyon said, 
despite the financial health, manager Alex Ferguson would have limited 
funds for signing new players this summer. ``It is fair to say that 
if Sir Alex wants to buy someone, he will have to sell someone else,'' 
Kenyon said. ``The reality is that you can only field 11 players at 
one time and we currently have 24 in our squad which, when it is supplemented 
with some of our younger players, we feel is the right number to get 
through 70-plus games a year.'' Ferguson has complained his squad 
is ``too thin'' compared to other high-profile European teams like 
Real Madrid. Kenyon said Manchester United's financial health contrasted 
with the problems experienced by other English clubs. ``We have significantly 
improved our operating performance,'' Kenyon said. ``The strength 
of the balance sheet and our diversified revenue streams have increased 
the resilience and competitiveness of Manchester United plc.'' ``We're 
delighted with what we think are a strong set of financial results. 
Today our shareholders will be very happy that we have a business 
which sets ourselves apart from the rest of the industry.'' (scw)

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of a deadly flu-like illness, 
worried Asian governments Tuesday invoked emergency measures, including 
quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been held in 
isolation in their contaminated apartment building. At least 63 people 
have died since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
or SARS, was reported in November in Southern China and then spread 
to three continents. An 83-year-old Hong Kong Tuesday became the latest 
victim of the disease, about which much remains a mystery to global 
health authorities. Officials said 240 residents of Block E of the 
Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to two 
camps, normally used for vacationers in the suburban New Territories 
and one on Hong Kong island. The building had been sealed off Monday 
amid fears that many people living there might be infected. Earlier 
officials said as many as 1,000 people who might have been exposed 
to SARS could be sent to four camps in undeveloped corners of the 
former British colony. In neighboring China, authorities urged physicians 
treating SARS cases to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer 
surgical masks. China's Foreign Ministry said British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair had postponed a planned trip to Beijing, but denied it 
was due to SARS fears. Thailand's government gave health officials 
the authority to quarantine arriving travelers suspected of having 
the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have yet to identify the 
disease that has sickened more than 1,600 globally and they are working 
hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms include fever, dry cough 
and shortness of breath. Most victims have been in Asia. Hong Kong 
doctors say some have responded well to antibodies from others who 
recovered from the disease. In Singapore, nurses posted at Changi 
airport identified seven suspected cases during their first 20 hours 
of duty. They were screening about 35 flights a day from Vietnam, 
Hong Kong, China and Ontario province in Canada _ all hit by the disease. 
``If we suspect a case or think a person is not feeling well we give 
them a mask and take them to hospital,'' said Albert Tjoeng, spokesman 
at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Australia on Tuesday 
announced its first case _ a man who had been in Singapore. He had 
recovered and the illness has not spread, health authorities said. 
In Canada, where a health emergency has been declared in Ontario province, 
Toronto authorities reported that at least two children had been hospitalized 
with the disease, and three others had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily 
banned shipping traffic between the Chinese mainland and the Matsu 
Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off China's southern coast _ because 
the islands' clinics wouldn't be able to cope with a major outbreak, 
the government said. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained at 13 Tuesday, 
while authorities issued more than 800 quarantine orders to people 
who had come into contact with patients. The Olympic Council of Asia 
decided to shift the site of its April 22-23 meeting from Vietnam, 
where four people have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official of 
the Thai National Olympic Council said. The World Economic Forum postponed 
a meeting of international business and government leaders that had 
been scheduled for April 14-15 in Beijing. The World Health Organization 
said Monday that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs 
continue to point to the coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth 
of all colds. In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong 
Kong apartment building seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official 
said. ``They are finding that the infections are in people living 
in apartments on top of each other, only in one area of this apartment 
block,'' virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters in Geneva. 
That differs from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole Hotel 
in Hong Kong, where the disease spread when people who spent time 
on the ninth floor in late February were infected by a sick mainland 
Chinese medical professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have 
a vertical connection,'' Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes 
and sewage pipes, about drafts which move up and down _ that's pure 
speculation. These are hypotheses that are being looked into.'' Before 
the quarantine was imposed, many residents of the apartment building 
had fled in fear as dozens of people became sick, raising the possibility 
that SARS could spread further. The other 18 buildings in the complex 
were not sealed off despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's 
health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were 
hit as badly. ``If isolation is effective to control the spread of 
the disease, we can say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung 
Ping-chung, an orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been 
monitoring the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens 
of staff have been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should 
be isolated?'' Leung said.

British forces said they saw signs Tuesday that the tide of the war 
in southern Iraq may be turning in their favor: Iraqis were starting 
to warm to their presence in towns firmly under their control, where 
troops felt safe enough to replace helmets with berets. Lights flickered 
on for the first time in months in the port city of Umm Qasr, and 
schools and shops were reopening. Significantly, more civilians were 
informing foreign troops about the whereabouts of paramilitary forces 
and members of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, British 
officials said. ``Within the southern area of Iraq, we see a large 
degree of normality starting to appear amongst the Iraqi population,'' 
said Group Capt. Al Lockwood, a spokesman for British forces in the 
Gulf. He stressed that tensions were still high in Basra, Iraq's second-largest 
city where British forces have skirmished almost daily with forces 
loyal to Saddam while trying to provide humanitarian aid to the city's 
1.3 million people. A correspondent for the Qatar-based satellite 
channel Al-Jazeera reported that schools and administrative offices 
in Basra were closed Tuesday on order of Iraqi authorities to avoid 
civilian casualties should they get caught in fighting. And military 
operations continued in the region, including a raid on Baath party 
members in the town of Safwan, said another British spokesman, Col. 
Chris Vernon. But Lockwood said residents were increasingly willing 
to approach British troops who have ringed Basra to give information 
about known paramilitaries and other loyalists. ``They realize that 
we are there to liberate them, not to occupy,'' he said. ``Certainly, 
there are still military engagements happening with the paramilitary 
forces, but the aid is flowing into Basra now.'' According to a senior 
U.S. Central Command official, some Iraqis are now reported to be 
cooperating in hunting down regime supporters in Nasiriyah, another 
southern city where U.S. troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, 
The official said he had also received reports that farther to the 
north, in Najaf, civilians were lashing out at regime figures. The 
British appear confident that they have reached some level of security 
in four southern towns. On Tuesday, British troops had changed their 
combat helmets for berets in Umm Qasr, As Zubayr, Rumeila and Safwan, 
British officials said. Lockwood said the berets makes the soldiers 
appear more friendly and approachable, and serve as a confidence-building 
measure on both sides. ``It shows that we have confidence in them, 
and they can have confidence in us,'' he said. In addition, more humanitarian 
aid was flowing into the region, including from the United Nations 
and other aid organizations, he said. U.S. and British officials have 
acknowledged the expected uprising by anti-Saddam Shiite residents 
of Basra and other southern towns in support of coalition troops hasn't 
borne out to any large degree. They have attributed the residents' 
wariness to the fact that when Shiites did rise up in 1991, allied 
forces largely abandoned them and left them to be punished or killed 
by the Iraqi leadership. ``They have suffered tragically, enormously 
under the Saddam Hussein regime,'' Lockwood said. ``And although it's 
taken some time because of the events of 1991, they're beginning to 
gain the confidence now, they know we're not going away. They know 
we will be there to protect them.''

The field is suddenly awash with billions to combat bioterrorism, 
and much more to come under President George W. Bush's Project BioShield

and marketable symbols of China, the only place in the world where 
they live outside captivity. For years, the Chinese government has 
been lending pandas out to zoos around the world, charging fees of 
up to US$1.2 million annually and spending the revenues on research, 
breeding and protection in the wild. China retains ownership and claims

of an elephant to reach the booming but remote mountain settlement. 
Today, the elephants are gone, Pilok is a virtual ghost town and her 
beloved husband has died. But ``Auntie Glen,'' as everyone calls her, 
has stayed on to start a small, idyllic resort to help the villagers 
in this still remote, now impoverished region. In Thailand's increasingly 
commercialized tourist industry, Forest Glade is an endangered species.

China expressed ``strong dissatisfaction and opposition'' Tuesday 
to a U.S. State Department report denouncing the country for what 
Washington said was a long list of human rights violations. The annual 
report, released Monday, said China had maintained its less-than-stellar 
record, which included ``instances of extrajudicial killings, torture 
and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest 
and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process.'' 
But the report also credited the government for releasing a number 
of prominent dissidents and granting permission for senior representatives 
of the Dalai Lama to visit China. At a regularly scheduled briefing, 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao vehemently dismissed 
the report as having ``no regard to the facts.'' ``We wish to express 
our strong dissatisfaction and opposition. We have been protecting 
and promoting human rights and basic freedom,'' Liu said. ``We have 
made great strides forward. ``We would like to use the opportunity 
to ask the United States not to interfere in other peoples' internal 
affairs, not to have a double standard and not to lose the trust of 
the people around the world.'' The U.S. government usually attempts 
to censure China on human rights at the annual meeting of the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva, now in its third week. U.S. Secretary 
of State Colin Powell declined on Monday to say whether Washington 
will introduce a China resolution at the commission meeting. China 
routinely rejects scrutiny of its human rights record as interference 
in its affairs. But the communist government has begun in recent years 
to acknowledge a need for change _ albeit on Chinese terms _ and to 
accept foreign technical advice on improving its courts and some other 
institutions, which includes guidance aimed at improving respect for 
human rights. In December, China agreed to invite U.N. investigators 
to study issues of torture, religious freedom and arbitrary detention 
_ a sign that the communist government might be serious about trying 
to improve its human rights record. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State 
Lorne Craner, who was visiting Beijing, said Chinese officials also 
promised to invite leaders of a U.S. government-financed commission 
on religious freedom. No dates were set. The new state department 
report, which covers almost 200 countries, also mentioned the Israeli 
and Palestinian authorities, the Eritrean government and Uzbekistan.

China's most prolific panda mother, Qing Qing, is pregnant again with 
at least one sibling to join the 12 cubs she has already given birth 
to, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. Qing Qing, who 
has been dubbed ``heroic mama'' for her talent in spawning offspring, 
showed signs of pregnancy recently after mating four times at the 
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and Research Base in southwestern China, 
Xinhua said. She is expected to give birth in August. The 22-year-old 
has already produced four sets of twins and four single births since 
1989. Fertility runs in her blood: Mother Mei Mei gave birth to nine 
panda cubs between 1980-1990. Pandas are among the world's most endangered 
species, a quandary made worse by their notoriously low rates of fertility 
and slow rates of reproduction. Chinese scientists say only about 
one in five female pandas are even capable of producing a fully developed 
ovum. Chinese researchers have turned to artificial insemination and 
even studies in cloning in hopes of producing future generations of 
what has come to be seen as an unofficial national mascot. About 1,000 
giant pandas survive in the wild and 110 more live in captivity throughout 
the world.

The United Nations should send human rights monitors to Iraq as soon 
as the security situation allows such a move, a U.N. expert said Tuesday. 
``I would go tomorrow if the circumstances allowed it,'' Andreas Mavrommatis 
told a session of the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. ``There 
is a lot to be gained by a U.N. presence in Iraq in the future in 
the field of human rights.'' The Cypriot specialist presented a 15-page 
report on the rights situation in Iraq to the commission, which is 
currently holding its annual six week session. The report, which was 
prepared before the start of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, makes no direct 
reference to the conflict. But in his speech to the commission Mavrommatis 
urged both sides to ``scrupulously observe international humanitarian 
law and shield the civilian population from the consequences of war.'' 
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed 
for US$1.6 million to send observers to Iraq ``when conditions permit,'' 
spokesman Jose Diaz said Tuesday. Mavrommatis said he reiterated all 
his recommendations from previous reports. Last year, he urged Iraq 
to adopt a moratorium on executions, reduce the number of crimes which 
carry the death penalty and improve prison conditions. He also criticized 
discrimination against Iraq's Kurds and Shiite Muslims, who have suffered 
under Saddam Hussein's rule. Cooperation with Iraq was ``a slow, painstaking 
process,'' Mavrommatis said. Baghdad's replies to his questions and 
recommendations ``are at times incomplete and unsatisfactory.'' Mavrommatis 
was appointed in 1999 and visited the country for the first time in 
February 2002 at the invitation of Iraqi authorities. He planned a 
further visit earlier this year but ``unfolding events in Iraq forced 
me to postpone second visit to the country,'' he told the commission. 
Instead, he met with diplomats from Iraq's mission to U.N. European 
offices in Geneva on three occasions. Iraqi Ambassador Samir al-Nima 
said the report was influenced by ``unwarranted and unjustified political 
considerations,'' and failed to address violations by coalition forces 
attacking Iraq. He said Baghdad had cooperated properly with the U.N. 
expert but Mavrommatis had relied too heavily on ``information from 
sources hostile to Iraq.'' Even as war loomed, Mavrommatis ``should 
have visited Iraq, to ensure his report was credible,'' al-Nima said. 
Mavrommatis and other U.N. human rights officials now ``must visit 
Iraq immediately to see for themselves the human rights violations 
perpetrated by the bloody hands of the invaders of the 21st Century.'' 
In response, Mavrommatis noted that his mandate from the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission only allowed him to investigate the record of Iraqi 
authorities. ``I don't think I can examine violations in isolation,'' 
he said, citing the effect on ordinary Iraqis of 12 years of U.N. 
sanctions. ``But it's up to the commission to decide on changes to 
my mandate.'' ^ (jf-nk) &lt;

Police arrested 10 Sri Lankans on Tuesday after their alleged attempt 
to migrate to Italy failed because their boat broke down, a police 
officer said. The would-be migrants _ who were all men _ were forced 
to return to Sri Lanka when their vessel ran into technical problems, 
said G.K. Sumith, a police officer from the town of Beruwela _ 60 
kilometers (40 miles) south of capital Colombo. He said the aspiring 
migrants were forced to return nine days after setting off from Beruwela, 
where they were arrested Tuesday. Sumith said the men will face charges 
of violating immigration laws. If found guilty, they could be sentenced 
up to five years in prison and fined 200,000 rupees (US$2,080). Every 
year, hundreds of Sri Lankans try to migrate illegally to the United 
States and Europe in search of jobs. The island nation suffered 19 
years of civil war, which displaced hundreds of thousands and devastated 
the economy. The government and Tamil Tiger rebels are now engaged 
in peace talks to end the conflict. Last November, Italy deported 
1,324 illegal migrants, including Sri Lankans. Sri Lanka's Interior 
Ministry last year appointed a special police team to curb people 
smuggling.

Turkey is still plagued with serious human rights violations, including 
unlawful killings and torture, despite government pledges to eradicate 
the abuses and some improvements in the country's record, the U.S. 
State Department said Tuesday. ``Security forces continued to commit 
unlawful killings including deaths due to excessive use of force and 
torture,'' the State Department said in its annual human rights report. 
``Torture, beatings and other abuses by security forces remained widespread, 
although the number of reported cases declined.'' The report said 
the independent Human Rights Foundation estimated the number of credible 
applications by torture victims at its five national treatment centers 
at approximately 965, compared with 1,200 in 2001. The report did 
not say how many unlawful killing were suspected in 2002, but gave 
several examples of such cases. It said that in July 2002, government-armed 
village guards killed three people in the southeastern province of 
Mus, while in March, ``five bullet-riddled bodies were found in the 
southeastern province of Sirnak.'' Turkey has taken steps to improve 
its poor human rights record under pressure from the European Union, 
which it aspires to join. The new Islamic-rooted government has declared 
a ``zero'' tolerance campaign against torture. But the report said 
that still had to be applied. ``Although civilian and military authorities 
remained publicly committed to the rule of law and respect for human 
rights, members of the security forces committed serious human rights 
abuses,'' the 64-page report said. It quoted human rights observers 
and medical experts as saying that security officials often used methods 
that did not leave physical traces, including applying electric shocks 
to a metal chair where the detainee is seated rather than directly 
to the body. The report underlined the lack of universal and immediate 
access to an attorney, long detention periods and poor prison conditions, 
as well as limitations to the freedom of speech and of press. The 
report also said human rights violations were more likely to happen 
in southeastern Turkey, where the Turkish military fought a 15-year 
war against autonomy-seeking Turkish Kurdish rebels. ``Human rights 
advocates believe that thousands of detainees were tortured during 
the year in the southeast, where the problem was particularly serious, 
but that only five to 20 percent reported torture because they feared 
retaliation or believed that complaints were futile,'' the report 
said. Trials of security force members have increased in recent years. 
On Tuesday, an Istanbul court sentenced a former police officer to 
4 years and two months in prison for torturing and ``causing the death'' 
of a labor union leader who died in police custody, a lawyer representing 
his family, Ercan Kanar, said. Another police officer was freed and 
a third is still at large. Labor leader Suleyman Yeter died while 
in police custody in 1999. Kanar said he planned to appeal the sentence.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said that a U.S. victory in 
Iraq was ``far from certain'' as the Iraqi army still retains its 
potential, and warned that the campaign was prompting Russia to strengthen 
its own military, according to an interview published Tuesday. Ivanov 
was quoted as telling the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that the Russian 
military was closely following the war in Iraq, making conclusions 
related to the development of prospective weapons. He added that the 
Iraqis were still capable of mounting strong opposition. If U.S. troops 
''launch carpet bombings, Iraq won't hold out for long, but they are 
yet to dare doing that because the political damage would be huge,'' 
Ivanov said. ``But if they try to fight with minimal losses, accurately 
as they are doing it now, avoiding big clashes, the outcome is far 
from certain. Iraq has quite a serious army, and it hasn't yet started 
to fight.'' Ivanov said that Moscow opposed the war not because of 
its economic interests in Iraq, but out of concern for global security. 
``Saddam is neither friend, nor brother to us, and he will never pay 
off debts to us,'' Ivanov said, referring to Iraq's US$7-8 billion 
Soviet-era debt to Russia. ``It's the question of precedent: today 
the United States doesn't like Iraq, tomorrow Syria, then Iran, North 
Korea and then what: everyone else?'' Ivanov said that the war made 
it necessary to strengthen the Russian military. ``We are drawing 
some military-political conclusions, because this conflict makes us 
remember the words of (Russian Czar) Alexander III who said that Russia 
has only two reliable allies _ the army and the navy,'' Ivanov said. 
``While the international security system is coming apart at the seams, 
they must provide a reliable defense.'' Amid the growing strain in 
U.S.-Russian relations over Iraq, the U.S. administration last week 
accused Russian companies of shipping military equipment to Iraq. 
Moscow has angrily dismissed the allegations, and warned Washington 
against waging what it dubbed an ``information war.'' In other recent 
signs of friction, the lower house of the Russian parliament delayed 
the ratification of a nuclear arms reduction treaty that Bush and 
Putin signed last May, citing negative feelings over Iraq. And the 
Russian military scrambled its fighters to shadow the flights of U.S. 
spy planes over the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia bordering Russia 
to the south. Ivanov told the Komsomolskaya Pravda that the U.S. U-2 
spy planes have recently made four flights over Georgia, on three 
occasions coming as close as 20-25 kilometers (12-16 miles) to the 
Russian border. Ivanov said Moscow was dissatisfied with the U.S. 
claim that the flights were necessary to monitor terrorist groups 
in Georgia because the planes were flying to high to spot the terrorists. 
``We can't accept the explanation about combating terrorism and we 
have asked the American side to explain to us what was the purpose 
of such flights,'' Ivanov said. (vi/mb)

Key developments in the war: _ U.S. troops shot and killed seven Iraqi 
civilians _ some of them children _ in a van at a checkpoint in southern 
Iraq when the driver did not stop as ordered, U.S. Central Command 
said. A Washington Post reporter at the scene reported 10 deaths. 
In a similar incident, another Iraqi was killed at a checkpoint near 
the south-central town of Shatra. _ U.S. Marines waged a firefight 
against Iraqi forces in and around the town of Diwaniyah and take 
at least 20 prisoners _ A massive explosion shook buildings inside 
Baghdad, striking one of Saddam Hussein's palaces and Iraq's Olympic 
headquarters. A steady rumbling of explosions continued south of the 
capital, likely against Republican Guard positions. _ A Kuwaiti Patriot 
missile battery shot down an Iraqi missile before it reached Kuwait. 
Kuwaiti military officials said it was the 17th missile that Iraqi 
fired at Kuwait since coalition troops entered Iraq on March 20. _ 
The official casualty count for Americans stands at 44 dead, seven 
captured and 16 missing. The British death toll rose to 26 with the 
death of a soldier Monday in southern Iraq. Iraqi officials have given 
no estimate of military casualties but have said at least 480 civilians 
have been killed and thousands wounded. _ In Washington, lawmakers 
were balking at giving President George W. Bush the unfettered control 
he wants over money for the war with Iraq and the global confrontation 
with terrorism. _ Arab and Islamic nations said they would push for 
the adoption of a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly against 
the U.S.-led war in Iraq. The statement came from the Organization 
of the Islamic Conference Group, which has 57 member nations.

An Israeli court on Tuesday threw out an indictment against an Israeli 
Arab lawmaker charged with organizing illegal trips to Syria. The 
Nazareth court agreed with legislator Azmi Bishara's lawyers who said 
he could not be tried because at the time of the alleged offense he 
enjoyed parliamentary immunity. However, the court ruled that two 
of his assistants would still face charges. Bishara and his aides 
were charged with organizing trips for Palestinians to Syria, which 
is technically in a state of war with Israel. Bishara said his aides 
should have been cleared of charges as well, since they acted on his 
instructions. The two aides face a year in prison, if convicted. At 
the start of the trial, Bishara said organizing family reunions for 
elderly Israeli Arabs, separated from their family following Israel's 
creation in 1948, is a humanitarian act that should be supported, 
rather than condemned. The lawmaker still faces a second trial on 
charges of incitement to violence over remarks praising Lebanon's 
Hezbollah guerrillas in a speech in 2001. He is the first Israeli 
legislator to be stripped of his parliamentary immunity for public 
comments. Bishara says that he never advocated violence. The incitement 
charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in jail. Israelis 
were also shocked when on one of his trips to Syria, Bishara sat next 
to the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, at a memorial service 
for Syria's late President Hafez Assad. Prior to the January elections 
in Israel, the Central Election Committee ruled that Bishara was ineligible 
to run for parliament, citing his alleged incitement. However the 
Supreme Court overruled the committee and Bishara was re-elected at 
the head of his party, the National Democratic Assembly. ^ gr-kl &lt;

The French Parliament on Tuesday adopted the government's plan to 
sell more than half of its controlling 54.4 percent stake in carrier 
Air France. The vote in the Senate, which followed approval two weeks 
ago in the National Assembly, calls on the government to sell 35 percent 
of the company's stock when market conditions are good, leaving the 
state holding just under 20 percent of the carrier. The project requires 
a presidential decree to take effect. With the war in Iraq and the 
weak economy depressing markets, officials said they would wait for 
an improvement in stock prices before moving ahead with the plan. 
The sale was not expected before the second half of the year. ``The 
government doesn't intend at all to give away its interests ... and 
this operation will not take place until market conditions allow,'' 
said Transport Minister Gilles de Robien. The plan is bitterly opposed 
by the airline's powerful trade unions, which fear it will lead to 
losses of benefits and jobs. Earlier this month, several unions led 
a one-day strike to protest the proposal. De Robien has sought to 
ease union concerns, arguing that once the privatization program was 
complete employees would hold a 10 percent to 20 percent stake in 
the airline. The company's 70,000 employees would also retain their 
benefits as state workers for two years after the sale. The privatization 
of Air France would be the first by the center-right government of 
Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which has been eager to sell 
several state holdings in the hopes of improving their performance 
and helping to meet European Union deficit standards. (parf-jc-eg)

The death toll in a coal mine explosion in northeastern China has 
risen to 21 with three miners still missing, the official Xinhua News 
Agency reported Tuesday. Investigators were still looking into the 
cause of Sunday's blast at the state-owned Mengjiagou coal mine in 
the city of Fushun, from which 21 other miners escaped, Xinhua said. 
Authorities have shut another 23 small coal mines around the city, 
a major industrial center in Liaoning province, about 650 kilometers 
(400 miles) east of Beijing. Fires, floods and explosions killed more 
than 5,000 people last year in China's coal mines, the world's deadliest. 
Many of the accidents have been blamed on a lack of fire fighting 
and ventilation equipment. Officials have repeatedly pledged to improve 
mine safety but accidents _ some killing scores of miners at a stroke 
_ continue to occur with tragic frequency.

Lambasted for scoring only two goals against soccer minnow Liechtenstein, 
England's stars will be thankful to get a lucky 1-0 victory over World 
Cup semifinalist Turkey on Wednesday. It might not be enough to get 
the critics off their backs. But it will mean moving to the top of 
the group standings and getting back on course for a place in next 
year's European Championship finals. Team captain David Beckham said 
facing Group 7 leader Turkey at Sunderland's Stadium of Light is England's 
biggest game since last year's World Cup in Japan. ``All the players 
know it is,'' he said. ``Obviously we've had some big games since 
then but none as big as this. ``It's the biggest game of the group 
now. They've been playing well, they're top of the group, they've 
got nothing to lose. It's up to us to beat them and get the three 
points. ``We've got to respond,'' the Manchester United star said. 
``There are critics out there and we want to show them we are capable 
of beating this team.'' If England produces a repeat of Saturday's 
tepid 2-0 performance against Liechtenstein it will be unlikely to 
defeat a high quality Turkish team that has virtually all its World 
Cup stars. The squad includes standout goalkeeper Rustu Recber of 
Fenerbahce, Galatasaray's attacking midfielder Hasan Sas, Inter Milan's 
Emre Belozoglu and English-based players Alpay Ozalan (Aston Villa), 
Tugay Kerimoglu and Hakan Sukur (both Blackburn Rovers). A Turkish 
victory would give the World Cup third-place team a five point advantage 
at the top of the group and leave England realistically looking at 
a place in the runners-up playoffs. Beckham knows the Turks are no 
longer the pushovers who have never beaten or even scored against 
England in eight meetings, including two 8-0 thrashings at Istanbul 
(1984) and Wembley ('87). Their last meeting was almost exactly 10 
years ago in a World Cup qualification game in Izmir. England won 
2-0. ``Football has changed,'' Beckham said. ``But we need not to 
concede any goals and hopefully score a lot of them.'' As well as 
needing the victory to keep alive its chances of an automatic berth 
in the finals, England's stars may be playing for Sven-Goran Eriksson's 
job. The England coach has been a target for major criticism from 
the media for England's poor performances since the World Cup. An 
unconvincing 2-1 win in Slovakia was followed by a 2-2 tie at home 
to modest Macedonia in another Euro 2004 qualifying game. Then came 
the embarrassment of a 3-1 loss at home to Australia at West Ham's 
Upton Park in a friendly in February. Eriksson has been blamed not 
only for the results but for taking the passion out of England's play. 
The papers say the Swede's low-key, detached personality appears to 
have been passed on to the players. ``If you want someone shouting 
you have to change because that's never been my style,'' Eriksson 
told reporters on Tuesday. ``At my age it's not easy and I have no 
intention to change my character. I couldn't do it.'' The papers have 
also given him plenty of advice on his best lineup and best tactical 
formation against the Turks. Eriksson has to decide whether to start 
17-year-old Everton striker Wayne Rooney for the first time, stick 
with the Liverpool combination of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey, move 
Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes forward to partner Owen 
or leave the Liverpool man on his own in a 4-5-1 formation. Whatever 
his selection, Eriksson, who has Arsenal centerback Sol Campbell back 
after an Achilles tendon injury, knows victory is vital. ``All of 
our players know this is a really big game. We can't fail if we want 
to win the group,'' he said. Eriksson said he was aware of the criticism 
aimed at him and the team after the drab performance in Liechtenstein. 
``I read some of the papers and it would have been better not to,'' 
he said. ``We took three points, a professional job done. I know we 
can play better football of course but let's try to do that tomorrow.'' 
Eriksson acknowledged that Turkey had made big advances in world soccer. 
``You can't compare them with the Turkey of 15 years ago, they are 
one of the countries making the most progress in the world,'' he said. 
Turkish coach Senol Gunes, whose team has maintained its World Cup 
form by winning all three Euro 2004 games so far, said he has been 
surprised by England's results. ``England won in Slovakia but that 
was undeserved. The two points they dropped against Macedonia were 
a surprise,'' he said. ``England were not able to display the performances 
the English people were expecting in those games. ``But it doesn't 
mean England are a weak team or that we will win every game against 
them. We accept that it will be a tough game.'' It might also be tough 
for police and security staff at the game. English and Turkish fans 
are known for sparking violence and, of the 4,000 tickets sold to 
the Turkish contingent, some may have gone to Kurdish asylum seekers 
opposed to the Turkish government. Up to 4,000 police officers will 
be on duty at the ground and in the city center. Expected lineups: 
England _ David James, Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, 
Wayne Bridge, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Kieron 
Dyer, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey. Turkey _ Rustu Recber, Fatih Akyel, 
Alpay Ozalan, Bulent Korkmaz, Emre Belozoglu, Umit Davala, Okan Buruk, 
Tugay Kerimoglu, Hasan Sas, Nihat Kahveci, Ilhan Mansiz. (rjm)

The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said Tuesday he expects his 
agency's inspectors to return to Iraq after the war has ended. Mohamed 
ElBaradei, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said 
in a statement released to The Associated Press that the agency expected 
``to go back with full authority after the cessation of hostilities.'' 
``The IAEA mandate in Iraq is still valid and has not changed, and 
the IAEA is the sole body with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear 
disarmament,'' ElBaradei said. Inspections have underpinned international 
nonproliferation obligations for 30 years, he said. ``Only through 
impartial, international inspections can credibility be generated. 
Iraq is no exception to that requirement,'' he said. The agency's 
inspectors had made ``good progress'' since returning to Iraq in November 
after a four-year hiatus. The inspectors found no evidence Iraq held 
nuclear weapons, but agency officials have said more inspections were 
needed for a conclusive judgment. ``We stand ready, subject to Security 
Council guidance, to resume our work after the war and to provide 
the ongoing assurances sought by the Security Council, that Iraq has 
no nuclear weapons program,'' ElBaradei said. (sl/rp/swg)

Etched in Zackie Achmat's memory are the last choking grunts of a 
friend dying of AIDS. The HIV-positive law student could well die 
of the disease himself if he doesn't begin taking antiretroviral drugs. 
Achmat, an outspoken leader of a civil disobedience campaign that 
seeks to force the government to supply the expensive drugs widely, 
could afford to buy them through his private medical insurance. But 
he insisted Tuesday he won't take the drugs until the government caves 
in. ``I am taking vitamins, antidepressants, TB prophylactics and 
nutrients,'' he said, ``... But I need antiretrovirals now.'' Achmat, 
who was diagnosed with the HIV virus in 1990, is leading a new wave 
of activism to help South Africa's 4.7 million HIV-infected people 
_ one in 9 _ get AIDS-fighting drugs, even at the cost of his own 
life. Since August he has reported suffering from two chest infections, 
a degenerative nerve disorder, chronic sinusitis and thrush. Former 
President Nelson Mandela last year visited the 41-year-old Achmat 
at his home and, after praising him as a role model and loyal member 
of the ruling African National Congress, pledged to help his protests 
be heard in government circles. As a young anti-apartheid activist, 
Achmat was detained without trial five times. His new protest pits 
him against former ANC comrades. Like anti-apartheid protests his 
new group, the Treatment Action Campaign, chooses civil disobedience 
as its main weapon. The TAC, which began three years ago by smuggling 
generic drugs into the country, has quickly grown into a mass movement. 
It won a groundbreaking case last year when the Constitutional Court 
ordered the government to supply antiretroviral drugs to public hospitals 
and clinics. Such drugs are designed to block substances that the 
HIV virus uses to make copies of itself once it invades a blood cell. 
The drugs' introduction in the mid-1990s has turned HIV infection 
from a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease _ for those 
who can afford the price tag. But South Africa's government has repeatedly 
rejected appeals for all HIV patients to get the drug. The court order 
has yet to be enforced because of a gridlock in negotiations between 
the government, labor officials and other groups. Last week Achmat 
verbally abused the health minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, 
as she tried to address a public health conference. Achmat and about 
160 TAC activists chanted ``Murderer!'' and ``Manto go to jail!'' 
Shortly afterward, Tshabalala-Msimang offered to resume talks. ``I 
can't apologize for calling her a murderer because it is an uncomfortable 
fact that can be substantiated,'' Achmat said. The TAC claims government 
inaction underwrites about 600 AIDS-related deaths a day. Last month, 
Achmat and hundreds of other activists kicked off their civil disobedience 
campaign by filing manslaughter complaints against Tshabalala-Msimang 
and Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin. Tshabalala-Msimang has 
condemned Achmat's behavior but recognizes his right to protest. ``Through 
its disobedience campaign, the TAC spreads malicious lies that government 
`had the resources to take action to reduce the prices of HIV-AIDS 
medicines' but had failed to do so,'' she said, quoting a TAC pamphlet. 
She insisted that new legislation this year would ``give our country 
better options in accessing affordable, quality medicines.'' (es-sv/sp)

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of a deadly flu-like illness, 
worried Asian governments Tuesday invoked emergency measures, including 
quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been held in 
isolation in their contaminated apartment building. At least 63 people 
have died since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, 
or SARS, was reported in November in Southern China and then spread 
to three continents. An 83-year-old Hong Kong Tuesday became the latest 
victim of the disease, about which much remains a mystery to global 
health authorities. Officials said 240 residents of Block E of the 
Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were being moved Tuesday night to two 
camps, normally used for vacationers in the suburban New Territories 
and one on Hong Kong island. The building had been sealed off Monday 
amid fears that many people living there might be infected. Earlier 
officials said as many as 1,000 people who might have been exposed 
to SARS could be sent to four camps in undeveloped corners of the 
former British colony. In neighboring China, authorities urged physicians 
treating SARS cases to disinfect everything they touch and wear 12-layer 
surgical masks. China's Foreign Ministry said British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair had postponed a planned trip to Beijing, but denied it 
was due to SARS fears. Thailand's government gave health officials 
the authority to quarantine arriving travelers suspected of having 
the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have yet to identify the 
disease that has sickened more than 1,600 globally and they are working 
hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms include fever, dry cough 
and shortness of breath. Most victims have been in Asia. Hong Kong 
doctors say some have responded well to antibodies from others who 
recovered from the disease. In Singapore, nurses posted at Changi 
airport identified seven suspected cases during their first 20 hours 
of duty. They were screening about 35 flights a day from Vietnam, 
Hong Kong, China and Ontario province in Canada _ all hit by the disease. 
``If we suspect a case or think a person is not feeling well we give 
them a mask and take them to hospital,'' said Albert Tjoeng, spokesman 
at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Australia on Tuesday 
announced its first case _ a man who had been in Singapore. He had 
recovered and the illness has not spread, health authorities said. 
In Canada, where a health emergency has been declared in Ontario province, 
Toronto authorities reported that at least two children had been hospitalized 
with the disease, and three others had symptoms. Taiwan temporarily 
banned shipping traffic between the Chinese mainland and the Matsu 
Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off China's southern coast _ because 
the islands' clinics wouldn't be able to cope with a major outbreak, 
the government said. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained at 13 Tuesday, 
while authorities issued more than 800 quarantine orders to people 
who had come into contact with patients. The Olympic Council of Asia 
decided to shift the site of its April 22-23 meeting from Vietnam, 
where four people have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official of 
the Thai National Olympic Council said. The World Economic Forum postponed 
a meeting of international business and government leaders that had 
been scheduled for April 14-15 in Beijing. The World Health Organization 
said Monday that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, and signs 
continue to point to the coronavirus, which causes about one-fifth 
of all colds. In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside the Hong 
Kong apartment building seemed to be spreading vertically, a WHO official 
said. ``They are finding that the infections are in people living 
in apartments on top of each other, only in one area of this apartment 
block,'' virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters in Geneva. 
That differs from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole Hotel 
in Hong Kong, where the disease spread when people who spent time 
on the ninth floor in late February were infected by a sick mainland 
Chinese medical professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have 
a vertical connection,'' Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes 
and sewage pipes, about drafts which move up and down _ that's pure 
speculation. These are hypotheses that are being looked into.'' Before 
the quarantine was imposed, many residents of the apartment building 
had fled in fear as dozens of people became sick, raising the possibility 
that SARS could spread further. The other 18 buildings in the complex 
were not sealed off despite having multiple SARS cases, but Hong Hong's 
health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, said no other buildings were 
hit as badly. ``If isolation is effective to control the spread of 
the disease, we can say that this decision came too late,'' said Leung 
Ping-chung, an orthopedic and traumatology professor who has been 
monitoring the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, where dozens 
of staff have been sickened. ``And who can say for sure who should 
be isolated?'' Leung said.

Poland's health minister quit Monday in a dispute with Prime Minister 
Leszek Miller, the latest blow for the shaky minority government that 
wants to lead the nation into the European Union. Marek Balicki said 
he resigned because he lacked faith that a top health care administrator, 
whom Miller appointed Monday against his wish, could lead the cash-strapped 
national system out of its crisis. Miller's Democratic Left Alliance 
of reformed communists has led a minority government since he dumped 
the farm-based Peasants Party last month. His Cabinet has splintered 
under political pressures ahead of a June referendum on EU membership. 
``I don't understand the prime minister's motives,'' Balicki told 
a news conference. ``This decision is bad for the government, bad 
for the Democratic Left Alliance and bad for the repair process of 
the health care system.'' Balicki's departure after 10 weeks in the 
job added to the image of disarray in Miller's government, deeply 
unpopular amid an economic slump and unemployment at a post-communist 
high of nearly 19 percent. Reforming health care is another nagging 
problem _ one that has dogged all Polish governments since communism 
fell in 1989. Government attempts to cut subsidies and rein in health 
care costs have led to protests from poorly paid doctors and nurses, 
and patients often have to wait for weeks or months to see a specialist. 
And Hospital closures _ seen by officials as another way to save money 
_ have triggered protests by residents. Balicki said he objected to 
Miller's appointment of Aleksander Nauman, a holdover from the previous 
minister, to head a new national fund to administer the state health 
care system. A powerful official, the fund chief will administer about 
30 billion zlotys (US$7.3 billion) yearly in medical payments nationwide. 
The new minister was expected to be Ewa Kralkowska, a deputy under 
the previous health minister. The outgoing minister gave few details 
of any policy disputes, but Kralkowska was considered more of a Miller 
loyalist than the more independent-minded Balicki, who used to belong 
to the center-right Freedom Union. ``People who are not deeply rooted 
in the Alliance like Balicki have a weak position,'' political analyst 
Pawel Spiewak said. ``Miller doesn't trust his ministers.'' The government 
says the new national fund that began operation Tuesday will be more 
efficient than 17 regional funds introduced by the previous Solidarity-led 
administration. Contract negotiations with hospitals and doctors will 
be easier under the new system, the government says. Balicki's predecessor 
Mariusz Lapinski was fired by Miller in January over his handling 
of the health care system's debts. In other recent trouble for Miller, 
two opposition parties are seeking a parliamentary confidence vote 
aimed at unseating Interior Minister Krzysztof Janik for the recent 
botched police attempt to arrest two armed criminals that left two 
police officers dead. Treasury Minister Slawomir Cytrycki also was 
at the center of controversy as a dispute flared over long-delayed 
plans to privatize a state-controlled insurance company. And Infrastructure 
Minister Marek Pol survived two confidence motions last week accusing 
him of incompetence and drafting a highway tax bill. ^ (ms-ajs-tc-cb)

Cuban officials were in tense negotiations at Havana's airport Tuesday 
with a man who claimed to have two grenades on a plane with 45 other 
people on board after he unsuccessfully tried to hijack it to the 
United States. The Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on 
a flight from Cuba's small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced 
to land in the capital because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it 
to the United States, Cuban authorities said. Among those aboard were 
six children. The twin-engine plane remained parked on the tarmac 
on a remote runway as negotiations continued. Shortly after daybreak, 
a tank with a hose was rolled out onto the tarmac and appeared to 
be refueling the craft. The plane was surrounded by several dozen 
uniformed police officers, and two fire trucks and numerous ambulances 
were parked nearby. It would be extremely difficult for an average 
citizen to get access to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such 
weapons are heavily guarded by the military. It was also unclear how 
anyone would be able to get a pair of grenades through the heavy security 
checks at Cuba's airports, especially less than two weeks after a 
successful hijacking on the same route of a passenger plane to the 
United States. All incoming and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose 
Marti International Airport appeared suspended during the negotiations. 
An Iberia Airlines flight to Madrid was grounded and photographers 
and cameramen at the scene said that they had seen no takeoffs or 
landings for several hours. A government statement released early 
Tuesday said the Soviet-made Cuban Airlines plane was on a regular 
passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona 
when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United 
States by a man armed with grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, for 
their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution that 
preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' said 
the statement. The statement blamed the hijacking attempt on what 
Havana says is the lax treatment that six other suspected hijackers 
received last month after successfully forcing another passenger plane 
from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at knifepoint. The suspects in the 
earlier successful hijack were charged with conspiracy to seize an 
aircraft by force and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years 
in federal prison. They were granted bond, but remain behind bars 
because they have been unable to come up with the money. Cuban authorities 
were pleased that American officials decided to charge the six but 
were enraged last week when a federal judge decided to set bond over 
the objections of prosecutors. ``The entire responsibility of what 
could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government 
of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. 
In the successful hijacking, six crew members and 25 passengers were 
on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route on March 19 when knife-wielding 
hijackers took control of the plane as it descended toward Havana 
after a trip from the Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key 
West. The earlier hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was 
being launched. American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air 
Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined 
them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West. Sixteen of those 
aboard later opted to return to Cuba and the only non-Cuban on the 
flight, an Italian, was released in the United States. The rest of 
the passengers and crew members on that earlier flight opted to stay 
in the United States under a U.S. immigration policy that allows Cubans 
who reach American soil to stay and seek legal residency after a year.

A multibillion euro (dollar) aid-and-trade pact between the European 
Union and 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific nations came into effect 
Tuesday, aiming to fight poverty and promote democracy. EU officials 
said 16 billion euros (US$17.4 billion) in aid could now start to 
be disbursed to the ACP countries, many of whom are among the world's 
poorest nations. They said the financial aid would be disbursed under 
separate development programs for each ACP country. The new 25-year 
Cotonou agreement, named after the Benin capital where it was signed, 
was ratified by all 15 EU governments and all ACP members after a 
two-year delay due to concerns the package could violate world trade 
rules. The deal promises aid to ACP nations only if they show improvements 
in human rights and a reduction in corruption. The Cotonou agreement 
also encourages the ACP members to form regional trade blocs among 
themselves and with the EU to promote economic growth. Both sides 
have embarked on new talks which will set the tone of trade relations 
once the EU abandons a quota system which violated world trade rules. 
Favored quotas on bananas will be phased out between 2002 and 2006, 
and sugar and rice quotas will be phased out from 2006 to 2009. Koos 
Richelle, head of the EU head office's development policy department 
said Zimbabwe, Haiti, Ivory Coast and Liberia had already been called 
on the mat for alleged human rights violations before the agreement 
took effect. Zimbabwe has already been slapped with a slew of diplomatic 
sanctions by EU nations, including a travel ban for him and his cabinet. 
EU nations have also frozen all Mugabe's financial assets in Europe. 
Meanwhile, Cuba which is not a signatory to the new pact because of 
continuing alleged human rights violations, has lobbied to be included. 
EU Development Commission Poul Nielson said last month he would ask 
EU governments to include Cuba into the new agreement hoping it will 
turn the communist-run country toward democracy and improved human 
rights. Cuba insists it respects human rights better than most nations 
by ensuring broad social services for its people, including free education 
and health care. ^ (cb/rac &lt;

The human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday renewed its 
call for Myanmar's military government to release political prisoners, 
which it said number more than 1,200. The London-based group's call 
came a day after a similar plea from the special U.N. envoy to Myanmar 
on human rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro. The envoy told the U.N. Commission 
on Human Rights in Geneva on Monday that the pace of prisoner releases, 
begun in January 2001, had slowed in recent months. He said the government 
had implemented several moves to safeguard human rights, but that 
it might be using prisoner releases as a bargaining tool in its talks 
with the opposition National League for Democracy. ``If this is true, 
it is unacceptable and cruel, especially for elderly prisoners, some 
of whom are in their 70s and whose poor health is aggravated by long 
and harsh prison sentences,'' he said in a prepared statement. Amnesty 
International sent researchers to Myanmar for the first time earlier 
this year, and the group said that since then it ``welcomed some limited 
improvements in the human rights situation,'' but was also disappointed 
the junta ``has not released prisoners who are ill, elderly, or are 
imprisoned with their young children.'' Myanmar, also know as Burma, 
has been ruled by a military government since 1962. In 1988, the armed 
forces suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations and has ruled by decree 
since. The opposition National League for Democracy party won a 1990 
general election, but the military barred it from taking power, instead 
embarking on a campaign of political repression. The junta began closed-door 
reconciliation talks with NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi in late 2000, 
but they have had no significant result aside from the piecemeal release 
of some political prisoners. The talks are now at a virtual standstill.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair has postponed his trip to China, 
a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday. ``As to the specifics, 
you 'll have to refer it to the British side, but it is certainly 
not because of SARS,'' said Liu Jianchao, referring to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, which has killed at least 34 people in China. 
China welcomes Blair to visit at an appropriate time, said Liu at 
a regularly scheduled briefing. A spokesman for Blair's office in 
London confirmed the postponement but refused to provide any details. 
In Beijing, a spokesman for the British Embassy declined to comment, 
citing a policy of never releasing details of Blair's schedule. The 
dates of Blair's planned visit had not been released. More than 1,600 
people are believed infected with SARS worldwide, and more than 60 
have died. Organizers have canceled the women's world ice hockey championships, 
scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday. The Rolling Stones have 
also canceled concerts in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing due to concerns 
over the illness. On Saturday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
recommended travelers put off nonessential trips to China.

Leaders of seven small European Union nations gathered Tuesday in 
hopes of forging a common plan for thwarting larger members' hopes 
of gaining powers from a new European Union constitution. Leaders 
from Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Ireland, Portugal 
and Belgium were highlighting a potentially divisive debate on how 
the EU should be run once it absorbs 10 new members next year. Derisively 
termed ``The Seven Dwarfs'' in German media this week, the small EU 
members have traditionally had equal standing alongside Britain, Germany, 
Spain, Italy and France, thanks mostly to veto rights that enable 
even the smallest member to block a decision in key policy-making 
areas. But proposed reforms, now being debated by the 105-member European 
Convention that is drafting an EU constitution, could end vetoes, 
effectively giving larger countries a bigger say in an EU of 25 members. 
On top of that, France and Germany are lobbying for a full-time EU 
president who would serve a five-year term. The proposed president 
would have the job of making the EU more effective and more visible 
on the world stage. This new position would replace the long-standing 
practice of rotating the EU presidency among all member governments 
every six months. Small EU nations fear ending the rotation system 
will reduce their influence in shaping EU policy and leave them sidelined. 
The European Convention is debating, in particular, the abolition 
of vetoes in such sensitive matters as EU farm reforms and foreign 
policy. Under the chairmanship of former French President Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing, it is also defining what powers should remain the preserve 
of national governments, and which should be exercised at the EU level. 
Small nations want to keep a hand in such matters as trade and foreign 
affairs. They generally favor a strong European Commission, the executive 
at the heart of the union. Its members draft and monitor compliance 
with EU legislation and act as a guardian of sorts over the rights 
of small EU members. Ahead of the meeting, however, it was unclear 
if all seven could forge a coalition. The Netherlands, Belgium and 
Luxembourg generally hope to see an EU with strong centralized powers. 
Ireland and Finland oppose such federalist visions. Giscard d'Estaing 
has hinted he would like more time to complete the constitution, which 
is supposed to be adopted by the governments of all 15 members by 
the end of the year. (cb/rw)

Madonna has decided to withdraw the violent, anti-war video for her 
new single ``American Life'' out of respect for the troops fighting 
in Iraq. In a statement posted on her Web site Monday, the singer 
said the video was filmed before the war started and was not appropriate 
to air at this time. ``Due to the volatile state of the world and 
out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support 
and pray for, I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret 
the meaning of this video,'' Madonna said. The video for the title 
track of a new album shows Madonna wearing military garb next to dancers 
in camouflage on a fashion runway. At one point, a grenade is thrown 
in the direction of a lookalike of President George W. Bush. Scenes 
are intercut with images of war. The video also shows Madonna trapped 
in a bathroom stall, where she uses a knife to carve ``protect me'' 
on the wall. Warner Bros. Records will be releasing Madonna's new 
album April 22. The video was scheduled to premiere on VH-l on Friday. 
The single ``American Life'' has just been released to radio. _ _

The Russian Supreme Court on Tuesday knocked four years off the sentence 
of a man convicted of involvement in a 2001 racist attack at a Moscow 
street market that killed three people. Mikhail Volkov, 32, had his 
sentenced reduced from nine years to five years after the court dropped 
the charge that he had organized the killings, said Pavel Odintsov, 
spokesman for the Supreme Court. Volkov was convicted in November, 
along with three others who received three-year sentences for their 
involvement in the attack. The Supreme Court upheld the other sentences. 
In the Oct. 30, 2001, attack, several hundred skinheads armed with 
metal rods raided the Tsaritsyno street market in Moscow, targeting 
dark-skinned traders. They killed three men _ citizens of India and 
the ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan _ and injured 
40 others. The attack highlighted the danger posed by Russia's extremist 
and neo-Nazi groups, which have targeted dark-skinned immigrants from 
poverty-stricken formerly Soviet Central Asia, the Caucasus Mountains 
region and other territories. In the wake of the attack, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin urged police to pay more attention to preventing the 
spread of interethnic clashes and make stronger efforts to fight extremist 
groups. (mb/ji)

About 2,000 protesters marched through Manila on Tuesday to protest 
the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, as the Philippine foreign secretary supported 
a call for Saddam Hussein to step down. About 20 motorcycle riders 
led the marchers _ chanting ``Stop the war in Iraq!'' _ down the Makati 
business district's main road. Shirtless men and boys with letters 
painted on their torsos formed a line with the message: ``War is stupid!'' 
One activist wore an Uncle Sam hat and carried a toy rifle as he pulled 
an effigy of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, depicted 
as a lapdog with its tongue sticking out and painted with the American 
flag. Arroyo is among the staunchest Asian allies in the U.S.-led 
war on terrorism and has said the Philippines is part of the ``coalition 
of the willing'' providing moral and political support to U.S. actions 
to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. She has instructed 
the Department of Foreign Affairs to work with Manila's ``like-minded 
neighbors'' in creating a ``humanitarian consensus'' in the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations ``so we can join hands in extending assistance 
to the Iraqi people at this time of need.'' ASEAN includes several 
predominantly Muslim nations _ Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The 
other members are Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and 
Vietnam. Anti-war protests, most at the U.S. Embassy, have been held 
almost daily since the attack on Iraq began last month. Philippine 
Foreign Secretary Blas Ople said Tuesday he supports the Saudi Arabian 
foreign minister's suggestion that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein should 
step down for the sake of his people. ``Perhaps with the greater good 
of his people in mind, and with more nations echoing the same sentiment, 
perhaps President Saddam might heed such a suggestion and end the 
war by leaving Iraq,'' Ople said in a statement. Saddam would ``spare 
the Iraqi people from further humanitarian suffering'' by stepping 
down, Ople said. Last month, Arab leaders declined to endorse a proposal 
from the United Arab Emirates for Saddam to step down and leave the 
country to avoid a U.S.-led invasion. The Iraqis later refused to 
accept an Arab League delegation after reports circulated that the 
members would raise the possibility of Saddam going into exile.

American soldiers on the road to Baghdad fought bloody street-to-street 
battles with Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein, while tense troops 
in southern Iraq shot and killed seven women and children when the 
driver of a van failed to stop at a checkpoint. The civilian deaths, 
following days of ambush attacks, may damage coalition efforts to 
win over the Iraqi people and spark further global protests against 
the 13-day-old war. U.S.-led forces launched missiles early Tuesday 
toward Baghdad and the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala to the southwest, 
and circling warplanes bombed targets in the area. Buildings in the 
capital shuddered in some of the strongest blasts since the air war 
began March 20. The night sky glowed orange and smoke billowed from 
the Old Palace presidential compound. Rumbling explosions could be 
heard throughout the morning. Among the targets, U.S. officials said 
warplanes struck a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi 
National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say Saddam's son 
Odai runs a torture center. Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed 
al-Sahhaf said a total of 56 people were killed and 268 wounded Monday 
night and Tuesday morning. Also among them were nine children, including 
an infant, who were killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, 
about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad, he said. U.S.-led 
troops have relentlessly targeted Republican Guard positions in and 
around Baghdad in preparation for the war's likely decisive battle. 
U.S. forces battled some of these fighters from Iraq's best-trained 
units Monday in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah, about 50 miles 
(80 kilometers) south of Baghdad. Troops seized tons of ammunition 
and hundreds of weapons at the local headquarters of Saddam's Baath 
Party, along with maps showing Iraqi military positions and the expected 
route of the U.S. attack. To the south, Marines traded fire Tuesday 
with hundreds of Iraqi fighters in the town of Diwaniyah, about 80 
miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad. At least 20 Iraqis were 
taken prisoner. Other units fought to isolate Najaf in an ongoing 
effort to protect U.S. supply lines. A series of ruse attacks by militants 
in civilian clothes _ including a suicide bombing that killed four 
soldiers over the weekend _ have made the trek north increasingly 
dangerous for coalition troops. Monday's fatal shooting happened at 
a U.S. Army checkpoint near Najaf, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) 
north of Saturday's suicide attack. Coalition officials said soldiers 
motioned for an approaching van to stop, but the driver ignored them. 
Troops fired warning shots, to no avail, before shooting into the 
engine, then into the passenger compartment as a last resort, said 
a statement from U.S. Central Command, which oversees the war in Iraq. 
The van was carrying 13 women and children, and seven were killed, 
the statement said. But The Washington Post, whose reporter is traveling 
with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division, said 15 people were in the 
vehicle and 10 were killed, including five small children. The newspaper 
described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive crammed with the Iraqis' 
personal belongings. It quoted an Army captain as saying the checkpoint 
crew did not fire the warning shots quickly enough. Central Command 
said initial reports indicated the soldiers had acted properly. A 
spokesman blamed the deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics 
and its practice of using women and children as shields. ``The most 
horrendous thing about this is that this is the result of what is 
apparently the strategy of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, 
which has caused us to be on our toes and ensure that these are not 
suicide bombers,'' said Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. ``So the blood of 
this incident is on the regime of Saddam Hussein.'' Thorp said another 
Iraqi was killed Tuesday in a similar incident, at a checkpoint near 
the south-central town of Shatra. Meanwhile, Sahhaf, the information 
minister, claimed Tuesday that a coalition bombing attack near the 
Jordanian border targeted two buses carrying ``human shields,'' including 
Americans and Europeans. The report could not be independently confirmed. 
Peace groups in Jordan said they had heard nothing about such an attack. 
Sahhaf said the information had come from the Iraqi News agency. Central 
Command said it was unaware of any such incident. Meanwhile, Iraq 
publicly denied a report that Saddam's family had fled the country. 
A statement on Iraqi TV called the report ``a rumor circulated by 
the U.S. Defense Department.'' Iraqi TV late Monday aired footage 
of Saddam and his sons Odai and Qusai, but there was no way of determining 
when the video was shot. Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. intelligence sources have been unable to 
confirm that Saddam survived the March 19 strike on a bunker where 
he was believed to be staying but said, ``That doesn't mean he's dead.'' 
U.S. President George W. Bush warned Monday that Saddam ``may try 
to bring terror to our shores,'' while offering assurances that the 
war remains on track. In northern Iraq, commanders said forces searching 
the recently captured compound of Muslim extremist group Ansar al-Islam 
found documents, computer discs and other material belonging to Arab 
fighters _ including suspected militants living in the United States. 
The Bush administration has longed claimed Ansar is linked to the 
al-Qaida terrorist network, but there has been no indication it has 
ties to Saddam's regime. Elsewhere, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to 
death after he reached for a Marine's weapon while being questioned, 
Central Command spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Charles Owen said Tuesday. Near 
the southern port of Basra, warplanes from the aircraft carrier USS 
Kitty Hawk dropped bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht and another 
ship, Navy officials said Tuesday. The official casualty count for 
Americans stands at 44 dead, seven captured and 16 missing. Twenty-six 
British soldiers have died. Iraqi officials have given no estimate 
of military casualties but have said at least 480 civilians have been 
killed and thousands wounded. British officials say 8,000 Iraqis have 
been taken prisoner so far.

Two Islamic militants were indicted Tuesday over a bomb attack last 
year that killed 11 French naval engineers and two Pakistanis. Asked 
to plead, Asif Zaheer and Bashir Ahmed shook their heads to deny the 
charges that they assisted a suicide bomber detonate a car bomb outside 
the Sheraton hotel May 8, 2002, in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port 
city. Judge Feroz Mahmood Bhatti read out the indictment in the fortified 
courtroom accusing the defendants of conspiracy, terrorism and the 
illegal use of explosives in the bombing, which also wounded 33 people. 
They could face the death penalty if found guilty. Prosecutor Maula 
Bakhsh Bhatti said investigators have a list of 56 witnesses, but 
not all will appear in court. ``I will go for a few selected and important 
witnesses, beside bringing some circumstantial evidence and the statements 
of confession of the two suspects,'' the prosecutor said. Five more 
suspects wanted in the case have eluded capture. Zaheer and Ahmed 
were arrested last December and January respectively. The defendants 
stood behind a 12-foot-high (three meter) fence of iron bars, appearing 
calm and composed. The trial was being held by a special anti-terrorism 
court inside a heavily guarded prison in Karachi. The indictment alleged 
Zaheer and Ahmed belonged to Harkat-ul-Ansar, a militant group now 
called Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen. Pakistan authorities believe it is linked 
to the al-Qaida terrorist network. In the attack, the suicide bomber 
rammed a car laden with explosives into a bus carrying the French 
engineers, who were in Pakistan helping the navy build a submarine. 
The bomber and two Pakistani passers-by also died. In Islamabad, an 
Interior Ministry official said Tuesday French counterterrorism experts 
are expected in Pakistan later this month to help the government in 
its battle against terrorism. ``The French team will help train our 
forensic experts,'' Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema, the ministry's director 
general, told The Associated Press. ``They can also be helpful in 
training our anti-terrorism experts,'' he said. Pakistan's Interior 
Minister Faisal Saleh Hayyat was in France last week for talks on 
increased cooperation, particularly in counterterrorism. Pakistan 
is a key ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism in Afghanistan. The 
suicide bombing against the French engineers was one of several attacks 
against foreigners and Pakistani Christians by Islamic militants apparently 
outraged by Pakistan's cooperation.

Pakistan's top cricket body Tuesday said it hopes the country's starless 
cricket squad will do well in this week's four-nation tournament in 
the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan will play its first Sharjah Cup 
match against Zimbabwe on April 3, still hurting from its failure 
to qualify for the World Cup semifinals, which led to a drastic shake-up 
of the team. The final at Sharjah will be played on April 10. The 
Pakistan Cricket Board sidelined several senior players. Former captain 
Waqar Younis, vice-captain Inzamam-ul Haq, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar 
and Shahid Afridi all will miss Sharjah and some were advised to ``rest 
for some time.'' The board has appointed former test captain Javed 
Miandad as the new coach, and named the experienced Rashid Latif, 
34, as captain. The team also has a new manager, Haroon Rasheed, a 
former hard-hitting batsman. Former opener Aamir Sohail heads the 
cricket board's new selection committee. ``If we win in Sharjah, it 
will be a huge bonus,'' Samiul Hasan, a spokesman for the board, told 
the Associated Press. ``We have to be patient with this young team,'' 
he said. He said the team was building the skills of its younger players 
to give them international exposure to prepare for the 2007 World 
Cup in the West Indies. Among the new players are fast bowler Umer 
Gul, who has been compared to Australia's Glen McGrath. All-rounder 
Rana Naved-ul Hasan and opener Muhammad Hafeez will also make their 
international cricket debut. Faisal Iqbal, Misbah-ul Haq, Danish Kaneria 
and Muhammad Zahid have previously played for Pakistan, but need more 
experience. Latif, the captain, was due to retire from international 
cricket after the World Cup debacle, but agreed to stay on until Pakistan 
settles on a new captain. South Africa was originally scheduled to 
play in Sharjah, but team members refused to travel to the desert 
venue because of the Iraq war. The organizers then made the event 
a four-team competition between Zimbabwe, Kenya, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka. Pakistan team: Rashid Latif (captain), Taufeeq Umer, Muhammad 
Hafeez, Naved Latif, Yousuf Youhana (vice captain), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-haq, 
Faisal Iqbal, Shoaib Malik, Danish Kaneria, Umer Gul, Muhammad Zahid, 
Muhammad Sami, Rana Navedul Hasan, Abdul Razzaq, Rashid Latif.

Continuing its Mediterranean cruise through Euro 2004 qualifying, 
France has docked in the Sicilian capital for an encounter with Israel 
on Wednesday. The match is considered a home game for the Israelis, 
who are not permitted to play in their own country due to UEFA worries 
about security in the Middle East. While security will be high for 
the match, the game itself should be another easy victory for France, 
the defending champion. On Saturday, ``Les Bleus'' routed Malta 6-0 
in Lens, improving slightly on the 4-0 win scored at the home stadium 
of the tiny island nation. In a slightly tougher test, France defeated 
Cyprus 2-1 in the eastern Mediterranean city of Nicosia in September. 
In all, France has managed four wins in four qualifiers thus far, 
earning 12 points and thus running away with the automatic berth they 
can secure by winning the group. Israel and Cyprus, tied for second 
with four points each, are in a fight for second place and a spot 
in the playoffs. ``A zero-risk situation doesn't exist, but at the 
moment we don't feel under any particular threat,'' said France general 
manager Gerard Enault. France's current status is a far cry from its 
sorry state after scoring no goals and earning no points in last year's 
defense of its 1998 World Cup title. Since that ragged performance 
in South Korea, the team's only losses have come in friendly matches. 
Yet coach Jacques Santini, who took over the French bench following 
the World Cup, insisted his side is wary of Israel. ``I said that 
we couldn't take the Maltese lightly and the same goes for the Israelis,'' 
Santini said. ``There are no easy games or opponents, and for proof, 
just look at the results from the last round of qualifying. Who would 
have said that Germany would draw with Lithuania? ``I'm certain that 
the Israelis will find extra motivation by the fact that they can't 
count on the support of their fans.'' Santini could have also mentioned 
a 3-2 victory that Israel scored against France in qualifying for 
the 1994 World Cup, which helped keep France out of the U.S.-based 
tournament. For Wednesday's match, Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane 
will once again wear the captain's armband for France, since Marcel 
Desailly is out with an injury. Zidane scored twice against Malta, 
breaking his yearlong scoring drought with the national team. Patrick 
Vieira, the man Zidane beat out for the armband honor, is expected 
to return from a knee injury that kept him out of the Malta contest. 
``It's not painful anymore and I'm at the coach's disposal,'' the 
Arsenal captain said. Israel is coming off a 1-1 draw at Cyprus, where 
Omri Afek scored on a header in just the second minute. On Wednesday, 
an early goal may be the Israelis only shot at staying competitive. 
Israel coach Avraham Grant said two of his top players were doubtful 
with injuries: Racing Santander striker Yossi Benayoun and midfielder 
Avi Nimny. But those losses have not changed the coach's outlook. 
``Only a win would be a good result,'' Grant said. ``Although everyone 
knows France is very strong.'' Some 1,000 security officials will 
be deployed for the match, including officers from the Israeli secret 
service. Tight security was already in place Tuesday. Reporters had 
to pass through two medal detectors at the Israeli team's hotel to 
speak with Grant and team captain Tal Banin. ``For us it's normal 
to see people with guns,'' Banin said. ``We're thinking only about 
the French team. We try to do our best all the time. We have to be 
optimists.'' ``It's not nice to see (the security), but we know there 
are people in the world who want to harm Israelis,'' said Banin, who 
once played for Brescia in Italy's Serie A. ``What will be will be.'' 
The coach said he wished the game could be played in Israel. ``Our 
fans deserve to see a team like France, but this is the situation 
and we have to play in Italy,'' Grant said. ``It's not good to let 
terror win. I understand UEFA's decision, but I don't accept it.'' 
About 500 Israeli fans, 2,000 French supporters and a couple thousand 
Italians were expected to turn out for the game. Although local organizer 
Alessandro Amato said he was afraid that ``the local fans have been 
scared off by all the security.'' France reportedly did not want to 
play the match at one point because of safety fears. But Zidane said 
his team had no trouble with the logistics: ``We had to travel anyway. 
I would say, that if there is a problem, it's more for them because 
they can't play at home.'' (asd-fd)

Indonesia's national carrier cut by half the number of flights to 
the Middle East starting Tuesday because the war in Iraq has hurt 
demand. The airline said it would reduce its flights to Riyadh, Dharan 
and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to four times a week, said Garuda Indonesia's 
commercial director, Bachrul Hakim. Hakim said the number of passengers 
to the Middle East has dropped by 30 percent since the start of the 
U.S.-led attack on Iraq, including a fall in the number of Indonesian 
Muslims making pilgrimages to Islamic holy cities. ``We are closely 
monitoring the situation. We cannot continue the flights if we are 
unable to cover operational costs,'' he said. Garuda's business has 
also been troubled by a deadly flu-like illness that has been spreading 
in parts of Asia. The airline reported a 20 percent drop in passengers 
to Singapore and China _ which have been hit by the illness _ but 
has yet to cut flights to those destinations. The airline is also 
still reeling from the Oct. 12 terrorist bombings in Bali, Indonesia, 
which killed more than 200 people, mostly foreign tourists.

Lens midfielder Antoine Sibierski is confident of joining English 
Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur next season, a report said Tuesday. 
``If I go to England there is one team that I really like at the moment,'' 
France Football Magazine quoted him as saying. ``I like Tottenham 
and I like their coach Glenn Hoddle, who knows French soccer very 
well.'' Sibierski, 28, is a talented attacking midfielder blessed 
with an eye for goal. He has notched 10 goals for Division One side 
Lens this season, and managed a career best 17 strikes for Nantes 
three years ago. He feels he can succeed at London-based Tottenham 
and is confident of eventually replacing Tottenham's veteran playmaker 
Teddy Sheringham, who is 38 years old. ``I am watching Tottenham very 
closely because there is a player there, Teddy Sheringham, who could 
be retiring soon,'' Sibierski said. ``We have a lot in common in the 
way we play which is what makes me hopeful of joining this club.'' 
Sibierski has a clause in his contract which states that Lens cannot 
block a transfer if another club offers him 5 million euros (US$5.45 
million) or more. Meanwhile, Lens forward Daniel Moreira said both 
Tottenham and defending Premier League champions Arsenal, also based 
in London, were keen on signing him. ``They have both been watching 
me for a while,'' Moreira said. ``I would prefer to join a London 
club.'' Lens is in place in 10th place in the French first division. 
Tottenham Hotspur, nicknamed ``Spurs'', is in 10th spot in the Premier 
League. Spurs coach Hoddle enjoyed a brief spell playing for Monaco 
in the late 1980's. (jp-jc)

European Union officials will tell U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell 
Thursday they want the United Nations to take ``center stage'' in 
the rebuilding of postwar Iraq. EU spokeswoman Emma Udwin on Tuesday 
reiterated the European view that the United Nations has ``a unique 
capacity and experience'' to rebuild civil society in nations ravaged 
by war. On Thursday, EU officials will make that clear to Powell who 
will be in Brussels for talks with EU and NATO officials. Powell will 
meet with the NATO ambassadors but officials said some of his counterparts 
may also come to Brussels. For security reasons, Powell will also 
meet an EU delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou 
at NATO headquarters. Officials said the decision to not let Powell 
visit the EU head office _ only 3 kilometers (2 miles) away _ had 
``absolutely nothing'' to do with the recent discovery of listening 
devices in meeting rooms at the EU complex. ``We expect (Powell) to 
discuss the war in Iraq and ... whatever will happen postwar,'' Udwin 
said, adding EU was not ready to discuss specifics given that the 
war was still ongoing. ``This meeting comes too early for us to discuss 
detailed plans (but) it is important that we carry on discussions 
during the conflict,'' said Udwin. Given the souring of trans-Atlantic 
relations in recent months, she said it was ``encouraging'' Powell 
was prepared to come to Brussels. In Athens, Greek government spokesman 
Christos Protopapas said he wished Powell had come to the EU in the 
run-up to the war. ``Nevertheless, if he wants to talk on these issues, 
it is never too late,'' he added. The Iraq war has divided the 15 
EU nations and its 13, mostly East European, candidates. Germany and 
France lead a no-war camp while Britain, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and several East European candidate nations 
have sided with the United States. As holder of the EU presidency, 
Greece has been unable to abridge the rift, forcing it to focus on 
Iraq issues the EU nations agree on, such as Iraq's reconstruction 
and the U.N. role in that. French President Jacques Chirac emerged 
from a March 20-21 EU summit cautioning neither Britain nor the United 
States must have the lead role in post-war administration, saying 
it would only legitimize the war they started. The EU delegation that 
will meet with Powell will comprise Papandreou, EU External Relations 
Commissioner Chris Patten and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and 
security affairs chief. Patten said recently that unless the United 
Nations gets a lead role in rebuilding Iraq, it will be difficult 
for EU governments to provide significant reconstruction funding. 
Before Powell left for his trip to Turkey and Brussels, U.S. State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he would also discuss with 
the allies the makeup of a peacekeeping force. ``We have allies with 
different views. We will be talking about that,'' he said. ``The issue 
at this moment for us and the Europeans on the diplomatic track is 
to look at what is going on in Iraq, not in terms of the past, but 
in terms of what we can do to give the Iraqis a better future.'' ^

Vice President Dick Cheney has postponed an April trip to China, Japan 
and South Korea to stay close to the White House during the Iraq war. 
``This is not the right time so we're going to postpone the trip for 
a later date,'' his spokeswoman, Jennifer Millerwise, said Monday. 
She noted that President George W. Bush put off a trip to Africa in 
January for the same reason. Cheney was scheduled to spend two weeks 
in Asia, plus a brief stop in Hawaii. ``It's an important region and 
we'll need significant time to accomplish our objectives,'' Millerwise 
said. ``We want to do it when we have the time'' for a lengthy trip.

Fearful that the isolation of 240 people in a Hong Kong building has 
not stopped the spread of a mystery disease, health officials said 
Tuesday they would move the residents into quarantine camps. A rumor 
apparently circulated via e-mail that Hong Kong would be declared 
an ``infected city'' sent some residents scurrying out to stock up 
on food and other provisions, but officials said it was false and 
insisted there was no shortage of basic necessities in this wealthy 
territory. Residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex 
were being moved Tuesday night to camps used by vacationers, one in 
the suburban New Territories and one on Hong Kong island, said Dr. 
Leung Pak-yin, deputy director of health. Leung said an ``environmental 
factor'' in the sealed-off building might be causing the disease to 
spread, but he did not elaborate in an evening statement he read out 
to reporters. There has been speculation a sewage leak might have 
spread the disease among residents of apartment units at one end of 
the 33-story building. Leung said health officials were still investigating 
but he did not take questions. The health secretary, Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong, 
was to hold a news conference later Tuesday night. Hong Kong officials 
said Tuesday an additional 75 people were hit by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, including 52 from the Amoy Gardens complex. It 
was not immediately clear how many of the new cases had come from 
Block E, which was sealed off Monday with barricades and police tape. 
Residents were told Monday they would have to stay inside for 10 days, 
with regular medical checkups and three free meals a day provided. 
A day later, they found out they were being moved, under a quarantine 
law dating to colonial days intended to halt the spread of infectious 
diseases. They will get checkups and free meals in the quarantine 
camps, Leung said, but it was not immediately clear what their living 
conditions will be like. Authorities had said previously that some 
200 people were infected at Amoy Gardens, about half of them from 
the building that was sealed off. There was no updated figure for 
Amoy Gardens cases by late Tuesday. Panic spread in Hong Kong amid 
rumors that officials were about to declare it an ``infected city,'' 
sending shoppers rushing out to stock up on basic provisions. The 
rumor was reportedly spread by someone who sent out e-mails using 
the Web page design of a Chinese-language newspaper. Hong Kong officials 
scrambled to quash it _ making multiple phone calls to journalists 
and even sending text messages to their mobile phones. The newspaper, 
Ming Pao, did not immediately return a reporter's phone calls asking 
about the reported hacking on its Web site. Health Director Dr. Margaret 
Chan met with reporters to deny the rumor and added that Hong Kong 
has plenty of food and other goods, ``so there is no need for anybody 
to have a run.''

A colleague of four Western journalists and another American who entered 
Iraq without visas at the start of the war said Tuesday he believed 
they were being detained by Iraqi authorities. Nate Thayer, an award-winning 
freelance journalist from Washington, D.C., said Iraqi authorities 
arrested him and his photographer, Molly Bingham of Louisville, Kentucky, 
at their hotel on March 24. ``After five hours of detention and questioning, 
I was released, but Molly did not come out with me,'' Thayer told 
The Associated Press. ``I believe she is with the others, although 
I did not see their detention and no one else did.'' He drove out 
of Baghdad to Jordan last Friday with an Italian photographer who 
was also being expelled. ``We believe they were detained by the Iraqi 
security forces, who believe they are something other than what they 
are,'' Thayer said. ``We want to correct this misunderstanding and 
get those people back to their homes.'' In addition to Bingham, Newsday 
correspondent Matthew McAllester, 33, Newsday photographer Moises 
Saman, 29; Danish freelance photographer Johan Rydeng Spanner, and 
an American peace activist, Philip Latasha, are unaccounted for in 
Iraq. Thayer said that he, Bingham, Spanner and Latasha entered Iraq 
during the first hours of the U.S.-British bombing of Iraq and claimed 
they were tourists because they couldn't get press visas. McAllester 
and Saman went on the same day but with another group, he said. Journalists 
expelled from Iraq have told Newsday that security officials came 
last Monday to the hotel where McAllester and Saman were staying and 
questioned reporters. No one saw McAllester and Saman removed, but 
their room was empty when a friend went to check on them, Newsday 
reported. Spanner's photos of damaged official buildings in Iraq were 
printed in Denmark's Jyllands-Posten. The newspaper said Monday that 
Spanner was being held by Iraqi authorities on suspicions he could 
be a spy. ``Johan is an independent photographer and innocent,'' Thayer 
said. ``He wanted to show the world the horror of the war.'' ^ (snm-pfg)

The coalition campaign in Iraq has reached a phase of ``steady advance,'' 
but more troops and civilians will die as fighting continues, Prime 
Minister Tony Blair's office said Tuesday. Foreign Secretary Jack 
Straw called for an international conference to choose Iraq's new 
leaders, and said reconstruction of the country is likely to take 
years. ``Now we are in the phase of steady advance and you saw signs 
of that steady advance yesterday, moving in on Basra, wearing down 
the opposition there and elsewhere, beginning the process of changing 
the military profile in those areas where we are in control,'' Blair's 
official spokesman said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. 
The spokesman said the decision by some British forces to switch from 
hard helmets to berets on Tuesday reflected growing confidence in 
their position. ``No one is under any illusions. There will be further 
difficulties, there will be further loss of life both to military 
personnel and, despite all the best efforts, of civilians, as we saw 
in the tragic incident at the checkpoint yesterday,'' the spokesman 
said, referring to the killing of seven Iraqi women and children by 
U.S. soldiers near Najaf. Straw, in a speech to Britain's Newspaper 
Society, urged that a new government for Iraq be chosen through a 
United Nations-sponsored conference, following the pattern of the 
conference in Koenigswater, Germany in 2001 where Hamid Karzai was 
nominated to lead a new government of Afghanistan. ``I very much hope 
that following the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime, the U.N. will 
have a leading role in organizing a conference to bring together representatives 
from all sections of Iraq's society,'' Straw said. ``The objective 
of such a conference would be to place the responsibility for decisions 
about Iraq's political and economic future firmly in the hands of 
the Iraqi people.'' Blair's government has been pushing U.S. President 
George W. Bush to seek U.N. involvement in postwar Iraq. Rebuilding 
Iraq will be a long haul, Straw added. ``Turning things round in a 
fully comprehensive way will not be the work of months. It is likely 
to take years,'' Straw said. ``The psychological scars inflicted by 
Saddam will take even longer to heal.'' Earlier, a British minister 
said the checkpoint shooting was a tragedy, but doesn't compare with 
the deliberate killing of civilians by Iraqi forces. ``This is a tragedy 
that's happened as a result of the heat of war, as opposed to the 
callous murder and slaughter of the Iraqi people by Saddam Hussein,'' 
Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told Sky News television. British 
military officials and witnesses last Friday reported that Iraqi forces 
fired mortars and machine guns at around 1,000 Iraqi civilians trying 
to flee the southern city of Basra, which British troops have surrounded 
for more than a week. Many of the civilians were forced to retreat. 
One woman was reported badly injured by shrapnel, but there were no 
reports of civilian deaths in the incident. Britain has 45,000 personnel, 
including 26,000 soldiers, involved in the U.S.-led war on Iraq. Britain's 
Ministry of Defense said a soldier was killed Monday in southern Iraq 
while disposing of explosive ordnance, bringing the British death 
toll to 26 since the start of the war. The ministry said the soldier's 
family had been informed, but gave no further information. (ej-mm-rb)

Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of a deadly flu-like illness, 
worried Asian governments Tuesday invoked emergency measures, including 
quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been held in 
isolation in their contaminated apartment building. Officials in the 
territory dusted off a sweeping law previously used to halt epidemics 
during British colonial rule. At least 63 people have died since the 
first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in November 
in Southern China and then spread to three continents. An 83-year-old 
Hong Kong Tuesday became the latest victim of the disease, about which 
much remains a mystery to global health authorities. Officials said 
240 residents of Block E of the Amoy Gardens Apartment complex were 
being moved Tuesday night to two camps, normally used for vacationers 
in the suburban New Territories and one on Hong Kong island. The 33-story 
building had been sealed off Monday amid fears that many people living 
there might be infected. Earlier officials said as many as 1,000 people 
who might have been exposed to SARS could be sent to four camps in 
undeveloped corners of the former British colony. In neighboring China, 
authorities urged physicians treating SARS cases to disinfect everything 
they touch and wear 12-layer surgical masks. A World Health Organization 
said it had yet to be allowed into China's southern Guangdong province 
to find clues about the disease's origin. Even so, China shrugged 
off outside accusations that it reponded slowly and furtively to the 
crisis, the extent of which became known only last week. ``The Chinese 
government has not covered up. There is no need,'' Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Liu Jianchao told a news conference. ``We have nothing to 
hide.'' China's Foreign Ministry said British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair had postponed a planned trip to Beijing, but denied it was due 
to SARS fears. The British government confirmed that Blair would not 
go as planned, but declined to give details. Thailand's government 
gave health officials the authority to quarantine arriving travelers 
suspected of having the illness for up to 14 days. Scientists have 
yet to identify the disease that has sickened more than 1,600 globally 
and they are working hard to find a cure. Its initial symptoms include 
fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Most victims have been in 
Asia. Hong Kong doctors say some have responded well to antibodies 
from others who recovered from the disease. In Singapore, nurses posted 
at Changi airport identified seven suspected cases during their first 
20 hours of duty. They were screening about 35 flights a day from 
Vietnam, Hong Kong, China and Ontario province in Canada _ all hit 
by the disease. ``If we suspect a case or think a person is not feeling 
well we give them a mask and take them to hospital,'' said Albert 
Tjoeng, spokesman at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Australia 
on Tuesday announced its first case _ a man who had been in Singapore. 
He had recovered and the illness has not spread, health authorities 
said. In Canada, where a health emergency has been declared in Ontario 
province, Toronto authorities reported that at least two children 
had been hospitalized with the disease, and three others had symptoms. 
Taiwan temporarily banned shipping traffic between the Chinese mainland 
and the Matsu Islands, 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) off China's southern 
coast _ because the islands' clinics wouldn't be able to cope with 
a major outbreak, the government said. Taiwan's known SARS cases remained 
at 13 Tuesday, while authorities issued more than 800 quarantine orders 
to people who had come into contact with patients. The Olympic Council 
of Asia decided to shift the site of its April 22-23 meeting from 
Vietnam, where four people have died from SARS, to Thailand, an official 
of the Thai National Olympic Council said. The World Economic Forum 
postponed a meeting of international business and government leaders 
that had been scheduled for April 14-15 in Beijing. The World Health 
Organization said Monday that experts hope to pinpoint the cause soon, 
and signs continue to point to the coronavirus, which causes about 
one-fifth of all colds. In a new and perplexing twist, the germ inside 
the Hong Kong apartment building seemed to be spreading vertically, 
a WHO official said. ``They are finding that the infections are in 
people living in apartments on top of each other, only in one area 
of this apartment block,'' virologist Klaus Stohr said at WHO headquarters 
in Geneva. That differs from the pattern seen earlier at the Metropole 
Hotel in Hong Kong, where the disease spread when people who spent 
time on the ninth floor in late February were infected by a sick mainland 
Chinese medical professor. ``That was horizontal, and now you have 
a vertical connection,'' Stohr said. ``You can talk about water pipes 
and sewage pipes, about drafts which move up and down _ that's pure 
speculation. These are hypotheses that are being looked into.''
