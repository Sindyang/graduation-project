Terror threat on the rise after anti-Western attack foiled in Amman 
by Bertrand Rosenthal ATTENTION - REPETITION CORRECTING typo in lead 
/// AMMAN, April 1 (AFP) - The arrest of four men accused of plotting 
to blow up a luxury hotel in Amman showed Tuesday that the threat 
of terrorist attacks hangs over the Middle East region, and beyond, 
since the US-led strike on Iraq began twelve days ago. Vatican foreign 
minister Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran warned last week: "This war will 
give birth to all possible types of extremism, including Islamic. 
We should be aware of that. It will cause terrorism." Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak for his part warned Monday that the "appalling human 
tragedy" resulting from the fighting in Iraq could produce "100 Osama 
bin Ladens", referring to the head of the al-Qaeda terror movement. 
Jordanian authorities arrested four Iraqis on suspicion of plotting 
to blow up a luxury Amman hotel frequented by US nationals and foreign 
journalists, diplomatic sources told AFP Tuesday. And Iraqi diplomats, 
recently expelled from the kingdom, were reportedly planning to poison 
water supplies serving military bases near the Iraqi border used by 
US personnel, the sources said. Last Friday, Washington said it had 
foiled two Iraqi plots against US interests in two unnamed Middle 
Eastern countries and added that similar plans had been uncovered 
in some ten cities worldwide. That same day, President George W. Bush's 
administration said terrorists were planning anti-American attacks 
in Yemen. It asked some 60 countries to expel Iraqi diplomats. "Many 
went ahead," said a US official, though the actual number was 17, 
expelling a total of 70 diplomats. Meanwhile the Palestinian radical 
movement Islamic Jihad said it had sent suicide bombers to Baghdad 
to fight invading US and British forces, the day after a suicide attack 
in Iraq which killed four US troops, attributed to an Iraqi non-commissioned 
officer but likened to terrorism by the Pentagon. The announcement 
came at the same time as the group claimed responsibility for a suicide 
attack in the Israeli town of Netanya Sunday which killed the bomber 
and injured 26 people, and which the group said was "a gift from Palestine 
to the heroic people of Iraq." The fear of attacks has affected Europe, 
where a survey revealed Monday that 69 percent of Spaniards dread 
operations by hardline Islamist groups on their soil. Security has 
also been stepped up in Britain, Germany and France. Britain revised 
its travel advice for northeast and east Malaysia Friday, urging people 
to take account of the threat posed by Philippines-based group Abu 
Sayyaf. In Chile, the police said two attacks against US and Spanish 
firms were linked to groups opposing the war in Iraq. And in the United 
States Chicago mayor Richard Daley announced that the city had closed 
a downtown airport used mainly by private and business aircraft to 
protect the country's third largest city from aerial attack. br/sc/mb

Two-time champion Peter Gade of Denmark lashed out at international 
badminton regulations after being forced to qualify for the main draw 
at the 180,000-dollar Japan Open on Tuesday. The former world number 
one, who came back from knee surgery to win the US Open in September, 
trounced Thiraya Laohathaimongkol of Thailand 15-0, 15-0 and went 
on to beat Japan's Shinya Otsuka 15-10, 15-6 to make the main draw. 
But Gade was irritated that he had been made to play preliminary rounds 
after his lengthy lay-off last year saw him slide in the rankings. 
"It's a stupid rule," said Gade, who injured his right knee because 
of "too much practice." "I knew when I was away with the injury, I 
had to play qualification in a lot of tournaments before I'm back. 
It should be a ranking safety security. "I don't think as a sport 
we can afford to have good players playing qualification. "Now I'm 
on my way back and I take one step at a time. I still need about 10 
to 15 percent to be on that level (when he was number one), but now 
I have a lot of motivation, I'm getting better and better," he added. 
Winning back the title he won in 1998 and 1999 will be tough for Gade, 
who is likely to meet defending champion and Asian Games silver medallist 
Lee Hyun-Il of South Korea in the quarter-finals. Former All-England 
champion Chen Hong is top seed, with fellow Chinese Xia Xuanze seeded 
two. Chen is in the same half of the draw as 2001 Japan Open winner 
Muhammad Roslin Hashim of Malaysia, eighth seed Boonsak Polsana of 
Thailand, fourth seed Kenneth Jonassen of Denmark, fifth seed Ong 
Ewe hock of Malaysia, and 2000 Asian junior champion Lin Dan of China, 
ninth seed. In the bottom half with Xia are Lee, Thailand Open winner 
Ronald Susilo of Singapore, Roslin's younger brother Muhammad Hafiz 
Hashim, who upset Chen to win the All-England in February, Asian Games 
champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia, and European champion Peter 
Rasmussen of Denmark. Chinese women are expected to dominate the women's 
singles with top seed Zhang Ning, world champion Gong Ruina, third 
seed, two-time defending champion Zhou Mi, fourth seed, and sixth 
seed Xie Xingfang leading the draw. Challengers against them are former 
Chinese national team player Wang Chen, seeded second, 1997 Japan 
Open winner Mia Audina of the Netherlands, seventh seed, the 1998 
Asian Games champion Kanako Yonekura of Japan, fifth seed, and 1999 
world champion Camilla Martin of Denmark, eighth seed. hf/rcw Badminton-JPN

The Indian government said Tuesday it would provide an "escort service" 
to its software professionals to guide them on visa regulations after 
a recent spate of arrests abroad. "One must be very scrupulous with 
the visas," Minister for Communications and Information Technology 
Arun Shourie told reporters here. "The IT ministry along with the 
National Association of Software and Service Companies (India's premier 
IT lobby) will jointly provide an escort service to every software 
professional who is going out to such countries as Germany and the 
Netherlands," Shourie said. "Our ministry will work with the industry 
on what the visa requirements are in different countries and tell 
them to obey scrupulously," he said. A week ago authorities in the 
Netherlands and in London arrested several employees of Bombay-based 
information technology firm, I-flex on alleged visa irregularities. 
India said the arrests were unwarranted and smacked of "economic protectionism." 
Earlier in March Malaysian authorities arrested 270 Indian software 
engineers over alleged visa irregularities, while last year top officials 
of Polaris Software India Ltd. were detained in Indonesia. The incidents 
sparked outrage in India and the foreign ministry took up the cases. 
The Malaysian acting prime minister personally apologised for the 
incident. "There are visa requirements and everything should be in 
perfect order. In Malaysia the police action was triggered by false 
information," Shourie said. Shourie said India's software industry 
was best in the world but cheap manpower being exported outside for 
software development and research was hurting the employment of other 
nations. "It does impact jobs elsewhere. The free movement of IT professionals 
depend on overall bargaining strengths of India. We have to be economically 
strong and competitive," Shourie said. jay/an/dv India-IT

International football federation FIFA on Tuesday postponed the Vietnam-Iraq 
2004 Olympic qualifier due to have been played Saturday in Damascus. 
The game was originally scheduled in Baghdad but Vietnam had proposed 
to organise it in Vietnam or in a neutral venue like Malaysia, Singapore 
or Thailand. It was later changed to Damascus by FIFA. The return 
leg had been set for April 19 in Vietnam. FIFA would consult the Asian 
Football Confederation about new dates for both matches. rw/ak Fbl-VIE-IRQ-FIFA-Oly-2004

Russian doctor to lobby for "green corridor" for hurt Iraqi children 
by Dmitry Zaks ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details /// MOSCOW, April 
1 (AFP) - A Russian doctor famous for his work in war zones said Tuesday 
he would travel to Geneva and New York to persuade the West to organize 
a "green corridor" for evacuating dozens of Iraqi children injured 
in the bombings of Baghdad and Basra. "We are not asking for anything 
permanent. All we ask for is that the Americans agree that they do 
not bomb certain roads for a certain stretch of time," Leonid Roshal 
told reporters. He said he mentioned the plan to President Vladimir 
Putin and that the Russian leader agreed with the idea. "I myself 
asked Putin about this and he said that he supported it," Roshal told 
reporters. "Who would not want to help children?" Roshal added that 
he was still waiting for a formal response from Washington but that 
the Iraqi ambassador to Russia approved of the plan. However the Russian 
doctor said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) -- 
which would have to play a key role in any such evacuation -- has 
been hesitant. "The Red Cross was very cautious and told me it may 
be too early to review this question," Roshal said without going into 
further details. Roshal has worked in many war zones of the former 
Soviet Union and most recently assisted both civilians and Chechen 
guerrillas involved in October's three-day Moscow theater hostage 
standoff in which at least 129 civilians died. He was awarded with 
a medal for his efforts by Putin earlier this year. Roshal said the 
Iraqi ambassador told him that 95 children were currently laid up 
in hospital in Baghdad and that most would probably need to be moved 
to neighboring contries because the Iraqi health system was desparately 
short on medicine. "The situation there is difficult but not hopeless," 
he said. "I would evacuate all the children but that is a bit difficult," 
said Roshal while estimating that there may be some two million children 
currently living in Baghdad. "So the first step is to remove the injured 
children." He added that France and Morocco have already volunteered 
to treat the wounded. Russia has fought furiously against the US-led 
attack on its Soviet-era ally and the Russian emergencies ministry 
is currently supplying assistance, through Iran, to northeastern areas 
of Iraq near areas controlled by the separatist Kurds. Roshal said 
he would fly to ICRC headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday to promote 
his plan. The Russian doctor -- who specializes in treatment of children 
-- said he would be in New York on Sunday to lobby the United Nations 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) to also support the project. Meanwhile the 
chief of the Russian Committee of the Red Cross said the children 
would have to be evacuated to neighboring countries like Iran and 
Jordan because it was currently too dangerous for doctors to work 
in Iraq. "We would not be able to guarantee the safety of our staff," 
Tatyana Nikolayenko said. But she stressed that the situation was 
more serious that the ICRC might want to admit. "The television footage 
we get here confirms that this is an emergency situation," she said. 
"We have very grave concerns." Roshal for his part admitted that his 
idea may be a long-shot -- but that he was ready to fight for it until 
the end. "Everything starts with a utopian dream and sometimes these 
later turn into reality," said Roshal. zak/hm/ns Iraq-war-Russia-children

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops shot dead seven women 
and children at a checkpoint in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, 
as Baghdad came under a fresh wave of bombing targeting Saddam Hussein's 
hold on power. The shooting came after a night of intense bombardments 
on Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite 
Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground 
attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace 
complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his iron rule, came 
under fresh bombardment on Tuesday for the second consecutive day, 
an AFP reporter said. The palace grounds have been a frequent target 
in the bombing. US forces meanwhile stepped up military operations 
south of Baghdad ahead of an expected major push on the Iraqi capital. 
The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) 
south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles 
Owens said at operational headquarters in Qatar. The incident was 
thought likely to fuel vocal international opposition to the war and 
undermine US efforts to win support from the Iraqi people. Owens said 
the victims, seven women and children, were in a civilian vehicle 
that failed to stop at the military post despite repeated warning 
shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. 
The Washington Post reported that 10 civilians had been killed in 
the incident and quoted US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny Johnson 
as shouting over the radio to his men after the shooting: "You just 
(expletive) killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot 
soon enough." In Qatar, Owens countered that: "As a last resort, they 
(US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," 
adding that an investigation had been opened. A written statement 
issued by US Central Command said: "the soldiers responded in accordance 
with the rules of engagement to protect themselves." "In light of 
recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised 
considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life," it 
said. In central Iraq, the commander of the Third Infantry Division, 
Major General Buford Blount, said: "We're very concerned... and very 
sorry that it happened." With US soldiers on edge after a suicide 
car bomb attack Saturday near Najaf killed four soldiers, Blount stressed 
that the unit that opened fire at the checkpoint on Monday had respected 
their rules of engagement. The shooting was expected to fuel vocal 
international opposition to the 13-day-old war, which the United States 
says it is waging with a constant eye on keeping civilian casualties 
to a minimum. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments on 
Baghdad saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing 
late Monday. Villagers on the edge of the capital reported that the 
blitz killed 20 more civilians, 11 of them children. AFP reporters 
said the raids on Baghdad were growing more intense and that the barrage 
late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit the battered 
city's downtown area. A plume of smoke rose into the air after a missile 
or smart bomb crashed into the heart of the presidential compound 
Tuesday. A spokesman for the Iraqi regime denied reports from the 
Pentagon that members of Saddam's family were trying to flee the country. 
"The fate of his family cannot be separated from that of the extended 
family (the Iraqi people)," he said, quoted by state television. The 
denial came after US Defence Department Spokeswoman Victoria Clarke 
said: "We have seen evidence that family members are fleeing the country, 
or trying to flee the country." In Kuwait, air raid sirens sounded 
for the first time since Saturday. A defence ministry spokesman later 
said an Iraqi missile had been shot down over southern Iraq. The US 
Army's elite 101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign around 
Najaf after killing several opposition fighters and taking another 
20 prisoner, military officials said. The "Screaming Eagles" began 
the third day of their campaign to secure the areas south and north 
of the Shiite Muslim holy city by sending in another battalion of 
Apache attack helicopters to support infantry troops. Najaf and Karbala, 
another Shiite pilgrimage city a further 80 kilometres closer to Baghdad, 
are considered vital to securing communication and supply lines in 
the push towards Baghdad. South of the capital, US troops reported 
their first serious fighting with the Republican Guard, considered 
Iraq's most determined military unit and key to the defense of Baghdad. 
US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the 
clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers from 
Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came as US armoured 
units finalised plans for a decisive thrust toward Baghdad within 
a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near Najaf, to the 
south. In Basra, seen as key to controlling the southeast, British 
troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making a final 
push to take the city. Flight Lieutenant Peter Darling said British 
troops were "nibbling at the edges" of Iraqi defences in the city 
of more than one million people which is seen as a vital staging post 
for humanitarian supplies. British commanders said 600 soldiers backed 
by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through the 
town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers to the southeast of Basra, as 
British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. British forces in 
southern Iraq were swapping their helmets for berets as markets and 
schools reopened, officers said. An Iraqi military spokesman said 
at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed in fighting since 
Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified number of others 
killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London said a British 
soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 the British 
death toll since the start of the war. US authorities say at least 
39 US soldiers have been killed. In Brussels, a diplomatic source 
said that US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions 
on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers on Thursday. In Russia, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said the war was likely 
to fuel North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Diplomatic sources in Jordan 
said authorities had foiled two Iraqi plots to attack US interests 
in its western neighbour, including a bid to poison the water supply 
of US troops and an attempted bombing of a luxury hotel. Asian stock 
markets and the dollar paused to catch their breath following their 
latest slump but oil prices edged higher as worries over the impact 
of war continued to shake confidence. burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap

Oil prices slipped on Tuesday after a strike in producer Nigeria was 
called off, though continuing disruption of the country's exports 
and worries about the war in Iraq contained losses. The price of reference 
Brent North Sea crude oil for May delivery dropped 39 cents per barrel 
to 26.90 dollars in early trading here. New York's benchmark light 
sweet crude contract for May delivery advanced 88 cents to 31.04 dollars 
a barrel on Monday, but was showing a loss of 76 cents in out-of-hours 
electronic trading. GNI trader Kevin Blemkin attributed the fall to 
news that Nigeria's principal labour movement had suspended a strike 
over pay after reaching an agreement with the government on workers' 
demands. The three-day stoppage was to have begun on Tuesday, but 
an overnight meeting with government officials led to its suspension, 
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "We 
held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo, secretary 
to the government, and the labour minister. And we agreed to suspend 
the strike pending the resolution of the dispute," he said. More than 
800,000 barrels of oil per day, 40 percent of Nigeria's production, 
has been slashed from exports because of violent civil unrest ahead 
of general elections on April 12. Analysts noted that even though 
the strike had been called off, exports from Nigeria are unlikely 
to recover yet. Commerzbank analyst David Thomas said the end to the 
strike "won't have any impact on production for those areas where 
Western oil companies withdrew their staff." "You still have Nigerian 
oil production below normal because of the situation there ahead of 
the election," he added. There was little sign of an end to the violence 
at the weekend, when political thugs attacked an opposition rally 
in Nigeria's troubled Niger Delta, driving activists into a river 
and hacking them with machetes, eye-witnesses said. Jitters over the 
situation in Iraq subsided slightly, though traders were still concerned 
by the prospect of the conflict dragging on for weeks or even months 
longer. "As the conflict continues for an extended period, the oil 
market is likely to be pretty steady... But you obviously get volatility 
within a day according to whatever news come from Iraq," said Thomas. 
"Some oil fields are under US and UK control, but that doesn't mean 
that they actually started to control production. I don't perceive 
that we will see any sizeable exports from these areas in the near 
term," he added. pf-dr/pw/hd Oil

The US-led war against Iraq is likely to push North Korea to develop 
nuclear weapons, a Russian deputy foreign minister said Tuesday amid 
mounting fears of a nuclear arms race by rogue states. "Unfortunately 
the Iraqi situation is driving the North Koreans to strengthen their 
defences," Alexander Losyukov said, as quoted by the Interfax news 
agency. Asked if he meant that North Korea would seek to acquire nuclear 
weapons, Losyukov replied that "this is absolutely clear, and the 
absence of a negotiating process significantly increases this danger." 
Russia is trying to organise direct talks between North Korea and 
the United States over the crisis concerning North Korea's nuclear 
programme. Washington has rejected such talks, saying that an agreement 
must be found jointly by all regional powers. "The North Koreans have 
already said that if they feel threatened, they will do whatever is 
necessary for their protection, including the creation of certain 
powerful weapons," Losyukov said. "North Korea clearly sees events 
in Iraq as a threat. I fear that the present situation in Iraq is 
pushing them in a direction that will harm the interests of stability 
and security," he said. North Korea and Iraq, along with Iran, were 
branded the "axis of evil" states by US President George W. Bush in 
his first State of the Union address in January 2002 on suspicion 
of wanting to develop weapons of mass destruction. All three states 
fall within the sphere of influence of Russia. Critics in Russia and 
elsewhere have warned that Bush's decision to lead an attack on Iraq, 
a state known to have no nuclear capability, while Washington spares 
North Korea, which is currently developing one, could drive some regimes 
to seek to obtain nuclear weapons while they still can. "If I was 
in the Iranian leadership's place, looking at how America is attacking 
Saddam Hussein, what would I do?" said Sergei Rogov, director of the 
USA-Canada Institute and an influential analyst, in comments last 
Friday. "I'd move ahead with full speed with developing nuclear weapons," 
he said. Alexei Arbatov, deputy head of the parliamentary defence 
committee, warned of a "worst case scenario" in which Iran and North 
Korea -- fearing to go the way of Iraq -- went nuclear while nuclear-armed 
Pakistan fell into the hands of Islamic radicals. Russia has vigourously 
opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq, with President Vladimir Putin 
last week warning that it "threatens to rock the very foundations 
of global stability." Losyukov, Russia's senior envoy on relations 
with North Korea, said that Moscow was "maintaining contacts with 
North Korea, China, Japan and South Korea as well as with the United 
States" on the standoff in the Korean peninsula. These however are 
"a poor substitute for direct dialogue" between Pyongyang and Washington, 
he told Interfax, warning that "a military conflict could break out 
if the situation remains as it is now." "The United States is against 
any concessions to North Korea, but we believe this is the only way 
to avert a possible conflict," he said. North Korea has never admitted 
to pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, but warned last week that 
"the use of force against Iraq ... (has) made us understand clearly 
that we must do everything for our legitimate defence." Earlier Tuesday 
it accused Washington of stepping up spy flights over its territory 
in preparation for an invasion once the war with Iraq ends. Washington 
has denied charges that it plans to invade the North and said it is 
seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis. The stand-off erupted 
in October when Washington said North Korea had admitted to running 
a secret nuclear program in breach of a 1994 bilateral accord. Since 
then Pyongyang has kicked out international weapons inspectors, pulled 
out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and fired up a reactor 
at its Yongbyon nuclear plant that is capable of producing weapons 
grade plutonium. bb/hm/ns Iraq-war-Russia-NKorea

A long war in Iraq will postpone a recovery in world tourism, the 
secretary-general of the World Tourism Organisation Francesco Frangialli 
said Tuesday. The way the war is developing "does not encourage optimism," 
Frangialli said and a recovery in the tourism sector "risks being 
delayed for some time." He said: "In the short term the main sector 
concerned is air travel, which is seriously affected and not just 
in the US," he said. But in the long term he said he was confident. 
"The sector has never experienced a long depression. There is always 
an underlying need to travel," he said. mb/hs/hd Iraq-war-air-travel-tourism-WTO

Six Germans have gone missing in Algeria's Sahara desert, diplomats 
said Tuesday, bringing to 17 the number of tourists reported to have 
disappeared without a trace in the north African country since late 
February. The six Germans, four men and two women, were touring the 
southern Algerian desert in three four-wheel-drive vehicles. Their 
relatives have said they were "very worried" about the group after 
they had no word from the six tourists since a phone call on March 
17, the diplomats said. The last phone call from the German tourists 
was made from the southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset, 1,900 kilometers 
(1,140 miles) south of Algiers, the diplomats said. On February 21, 
11 European tourists -- six Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- went 
missing in southern Algeria. Those tourists were travelling in three 
distinct groups: the Germans in two groups, one with four motorbikes 
and the second using two bikes and including the Dutch national, and 
the Swiss in a separate group travelling in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. 
The two groups travelling on motorcycles were last seen in Djanet, 
some 1,500 kilometres (930 miles), southeast of Algiers, and were 
travelling north to Ouargla, via Illizi about 100 kilometres (60 miles) 
north of Djanet. The four Swiss were travelling in the opposite direction, 
heading south from Ouargla to Illizi close to the Algerian-Libyan 
border. Despite the use of helicopters equipped with heat-seeking 
equipment to scour the vast, remote desert, where it was feared the 
tourists could have been buried with their vehicles in a sandstorm, 
no trace has been found of the three groups of tourists. "Eleven people 
with vehicles and all their stuff, that leaves traces. They can't 
just vanish into thin air," said a diplomat of the first disappearances.

Textured insoles in sports shoes could prevent many ankle injuries, 
according to Australian research published Tuesday in the British 
Journal of Sports Medicine. Physiotherapists at the Canberra Hospital 
designed knobbly rubber insoles to fit the boots of 17 players from 
the Australian Women's soccer team. The players were then tested for 
"movement discrimination" -- the ability to move the ankle appropriately 
for the required conditions -- under three conditions. They were first 
tested barefoot; then using their own football boot with a smooth 
conventional insole; and then using the same boot with the replacement, 
textured insole. Unwanted ankle movement was worst of all with the 
smooth insole. Next best was to be barefoot. But best of all was the 
knobbly insole. The doctors believe that conventional insoles can 
smother important feedback signals from the extremely sensitive soles 
of the feet. These signals are designed to relay information to the 
brain about pressure differences in areas beneath the feet. The signals 
then help the brain to ensure that the feet and ankle are in the right 
position relative to the rest of the body. If the positioning is wrong, 
the delicate bones of the ankle and feet can be wrenched. Air-filled 
and gel-filled insoles, designed to dampen shocks, may make the problem 
even worse, especially in fast-moving ball games such as basketball 
and soccer, the doctors believe. "The insole is one aspect of football 
boot and sport shoe design that could be modified to provide the sensory 
feedback needed for accurate foot positioning," they write. ri/ds

BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - US and British forces bombarded the main 
presidential palace complex in the Iraqi capital on Tuesday morning 
for the second consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. A plume of smoke 
rose into the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart 
of the compound on the 13th day of the war around 9 am (0600 GMT). 
Baghdadis however continued to move around the city as they have throughout 
the conflict. After a night of relative calm, heavy bombing resumed 
around 10:10 am on the southern outskirts of Baghdad, the reporter 
added. A fresh wave of bombing hit the city's southern rim around 
four hours later, when at least three explosions were heard in the 
centre of Baghdad. No air raid siren was sounded, but anti-aircraft 
batteries came into action sporadically. The sprawling palace grounds, 
a potent symbol of President Saddam Hussein's grip on power, has been 
a frequent target of the bombardments and was struck twice on Monday. 
During the afternoon a warplane buzzed the compound, the largest of 
eight presidential palaces in the capital, and launched a missile 
which was followed by two more strikes in the evening. Around a dozen 
missiles struck the Iraqi capital overnight. US Central Command said 
in a statement that coalition forces had used "precision-guided munitions 
to target a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad" at around 11:30 
pm (1930 GMT) on Monday. The complex served as an office for leaders 
of the regime and housed the youth ministry and the Iraqi National 
Olympic Committee, chaired by Saddam's elder son Uday, Centcom said. 
"The strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders," it said, adding that battle assessment was ongoing.

Following is a snapshot of medical knowledge about Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS), the term given to the form of pneumonia that originated 
in Southeast Asia and has triggered a global health scare: (Sources: 
World Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control, France's 
Pasteur Institute) WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF SARS? The main symptoms 
are similar to flu: high fever (more than 38C, 100.4 F), headache, 
sore throat, dry cough, muscular stiffness and wheeziness. Some patients 
develop pneumonia, and a number of them swiftly require artificial 
respiration. The mortality rate is about four percent. Many of those 
who die have other health complications, such as heart disease or 
diabetes. WHAT CAUSES SARS? The likely suspect is a coronavirus, a 
member of the same family as the cold virus. But an unrelated virus, 
called a paramyxovirus, which is part of the same viral family as 
the agents that cause mumps and measles, has been found in some samples. 
Some experts speculate the two viruses may work together to make a 
patient more vulnerable to infection. Incubation is short, between 
two to seven days, but jet travel means that cases can rapidly spread 
around the world. HOW CONTAGIOUS IS SARS? One of the biggest unknowns. 
At first, it was thought that the infective agent was borne in large 
droplets and spread only by close contact with an infected person, 
who for instance sneezed or coughed. This was because the epidemic 
was at first limited to hospital staff and relatives of people who 
fell sick. But a cluster of cases in an apartment block in Hong Kong 
has bred worries that the virus could also be airborne or waterborne 
-- in other words that it could spread through a water or sewage system 
or, like the flu virus, be inhaled in a fine droplet that is hanging 
in the air. These fears are being investigated -- there is no evidence 
yet to support them. WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR SARS? There is no known 
cure yet for SARS. Antibiotics have not worked, and an anti-viral 
drug called Ribovirin has had disappointing results. WHAT PRECAUTIONS 
CAN BE TAKEN? At home or at work, simple hygiene measures are advised, 
such as washing one's hands. Coronaviruses are often spread when an 
infected person touches a surface, leaving a virus that can survive 
for two or three hours; it is picked up by another person, who then 
infects himself by touching his or her nose or mouth. Keeping windows 
open and wearing a facemask may help prevention transmission in a 
SARS "hotspot" location. Patients with SARS have to be kept in strict 
isolation, and health care workers and visitors should wear filter 
masks, goggles, aprons, head covers and gloves when in close contact 
with the patient. WHERE DID SARS COME FROM? The first case came to 
public light in Hanoi on February 26, involving a 48-year-old American 
businessman, who was taken sick following a trip to Shanghai and Hong 
Kong. He was flown back to Hong Kong for treatment but died. There 
is also evidence that the first identifiable case of SARS surfaced 
in the city of Foshan, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, 
on November 16. One theory is that the pathogen mutated in livestock 
before leaping the species barrier to humans. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO 
COMBAT THE SPREAD? An international effort to brake the epidemic is 
yielding good results, says the WHO. A joint initiative to pool the 
expertise in 11 top labs in 10 countries was launched on March 17 
and has already identified the coronavirus as the likely cause. In 
developed countries, health monitoring systems to detect and isolate 
SARS victims seems to be working well. There are also international 
guidelines for vetting air travellers with the suspected disease, 
but the rising toll of infections, notably in Europe, suggests some 
are slipping through the screening process. ri/yad Health-pneumonia-medical

War will postpone recovery in world tourism -- World Tourism head 
ATTENTION - REPETITION, CHANGES slug, CLARIFIES WTO headline reference 
/// PARIS, April 1 (AFP) - A long war in Iraq will postpone a recovery 
in world tourism, the secretary-general of the World Tourism Organisation 
Francesco Frangialli said Tuesday. The way the war is developing "does 
not encourage optimism," Frangialli said and a recovery in the tourism 
sector "risks being delayed for some time." He said: "In the short 
term the main sector concerned is air travel, which is seriously affected 
and not just in the US," he said. But in the long term he said he 
was confident. "The sector has never experienced a long depression. 
There is always an underlying need to travel," he said. mb/hs/hd Iraq-war-air-travel-tourism

Malaysia's trade surplus dived 22.2 percent in February to 4.9 billion 
ringgit (1.3 billion dollars), the government said Tuesday attributing 
it to seasonal factors. The result was down from 6.3 billion ringgit 
in the previous month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI). Exports fell 14.8 percent in February to 25.9 billion ringgit, 
while imports declined 13.1 percent to 21.0 billion ringgit. The MITI 
said the value of trade is traditionally lower in February due to 
fewer working days in that month. In February 2002, the trade surplus 
was 3.61 billion ringgit, with exports of 24.03 billion and imports 
of 20.42 billion. Electrical and electronic product exports totaled 
13.1 billion ringgit or 50.8 percent of the total in February, 2003. 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remained Malaysia's 
major export market, accounting for 26.6 percent of total exports, 
followed by the United States, the European Union, Japan, Hong Kong 
and China. ASEAN, Japan, US, China, Korea, Germany and Taiwan were 
the largest source of imports. Imports of electrical and electronic 
goods totalled 10 billion ringgit representing 47.9 percent of total 
imports. Imports of intermediate goods accounted for 72.8 percent, 
capital goods 14 percent and consumption goods six percent. For the 
first two months of 2003, Malaysia recorded a trade surplus of 11.2 
billion ringgit, with exports of 56.3 billion ringgit and imports 
of 45.1 billion ringgit. During the period, exports were led by electrical 
products, accounting for 50.4 percent of total exports, followed by 
palm oil and chemical products. Electrical and electronics goods also 
accounted for 47.4 percent of total imports, followed by machinery 
and chemicals products. Intermediate goods imports accounted for 72.3 
percent of total imports in the two months to February, capital goods 
representing 13.8 percent and consumption goods 6.4 percent. jsm/dv

The war in Iraq underlines the need for a collective security organisation 
being planned by several former Soviet countries, the speaker of Russia's 
upper house of parliament said Tuesday. "At a time when the echoes 
of war in Iraq reach the Central Asian region there is a growing role 
for such structures... In April all arrangements for establishing 
this organisation should be finalised," Sergei Mironov, speaker of 
the upper house of Russia's parliament was quoted as saying by Interfax. 
The formation of a collective security organisation of six members 
of the ex-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was set 
in motion in early 2002. Mironov was speaking after discussing arrangements 
with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev in the Kazakh capital 
Astana. Among the collective security organisation's assets will be 
a rapid reaction force using Russian Su-25 ground attack jets and 
Su-27 fighters, which is being established in Kyrgyzstan. The organisation's 
members -- Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan 
-- are predominantly opposed to the Iraq war. Russian defence chiefs 
have been keen to counterbalance the growing military influence in 
the region of the United States, which has forces based in both Kyrgyzstan 
and Uzbekistan. Moscow is also seeking to bring into line ex-Soviet 
countries which it has said may have supplied arms to rebels in the 
breakaway Russian republic of Chechnya. An important security role 
can also be played by the Shanghai cooperation group, which brings 
together several ex-Soviet countries plus China, Mironov added. njc/zak/ds

ANKARA, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell was due 
in Turkey late Tuesday on a fence-mending mission to underline Washington's 
commitment to the strategic partnership between the two countries, 
dented by a series of rows over Iraq. Relations between the United 
States and Turkey, the only Muslim member of NATO, have deteriorated 
since the Turkish parliament on March 1 narrowly rejected US plans 
to deploy 62,000 troops here to open a northern front in the war. 
"In Ankara, Secretary Powell will meet with Turkish leaders to strengthen 
our relationship," spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington, referring 
to Turkey as "key ally in a key place at a key time." Topics to be 
discussed included Iraq as well as the global war on terrorism and 
Cyprus, he said. Powell will "make sure that nobody gets the wrong 
impression we're angry with each other. He's not bringing money, he's 
not going to bang his fist on the table," an Ankara-based US diplomat 
said. The State Department's announcement of Powell's hastily arranged 
trip, which will see him also visit NATO headquarters in Brussels, 
took Ankara by surprise. The Turkish parliament's decision, which 
US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz slammed last week as a 
"big mistake", infuriated the White House. Powell however was not 
expected to raise the troops issue with Turkish leaders. US naval 
vessels that lay off Turkey for weeks waiting for permission to land 
heavy armour in Turkey have long since left the Mediterranean for 
the Gulf. Powell might simply ask Turkey, which granted US warplanes 
overflight rights on the second day of the war, to agree to broaden 
the agreement under which its airspace can be used to help with refueling. 
Several Turkish newspapers suggested Tuesday Powell might have new 
military demands up his sleeve. But Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul 
dismissed the suggestion, saying: "What we know right now is that 
Powell is visiting an ally country. There is nothing planned". Powell 
was expected to meet here Wednesday morning with Gul, Prime Minister 
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and possibly with 
armed forces chief of staff, General Hilmi Ozkok. In Ankara, Powell 
will continue to hammer home Washington's opposition to Turkish troops 
entering northern Iraq, an area controlled by Kurdish forces allied 
to the United States. Ankara fears that Kurds in northern Iraq could 
declare an independent state, setting a dangerous example to its own 
large Kurdish population just across the border in southeastern Turkey, 
which has only just started to recover from a separatist rebellion 
which left more than 36,000 people in the 1990s. Diplomats said other 
issues, such as the future status of the divided island of Cyprus, 
Turkey's drive to join the European Union and the "war on terror" 
will also be on the agenda of Powell's visit. "The visit will focus 
more on bilateral issues than on Iraqi related contingencies," according 
to a Turkish diplomat. "It's a reaffirmation of our strategic relations 
... (to) make sure recent developments do not lead to a weakening 
of our strategic relationship," the diplomat added. The two countries 
could also discuss aid for Turkey to help it overcome the economic 
difficulties of the war, after Ankara lost out on a promised six-billion-dollar 
(5.5 billion euro) aid package from Washington when parliament rebuffed 
US overtures on troop deployments. The White House has asked Congress 
to decide by mid-April on economic aid for countries which border 
Iraq. Erdogan said he was writing to all the members of the US Congress 
to explain the situation in his country where more than 90 percent 
of the population is opposed to the war. fc/jkb Iraq-war-US-Turkey

An overwhelming majority of Finns are opposed to the US-led war on 
Iraq, an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed. Seventy-six percent 
of Finns said they were against the war, while 14 percent said they 
supported it, said a poll by the Taloustutkimus institute. Some 10 
percent were undecided, according to the poll, which surveyed 1,000 
people between March 25-27. The poll also showed that opposition to 
the war is strongest among Finnish women, with 85 percent of them 
saying they are against it, while 67 percent of men polled said they 
objected to the war. paa/po/yad Iraq-war-Finland-poll

NASIRIYAH, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US marines found four arms caches 
in an aluminium factory in the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriyah, an 
AFP photographer at the scene reported. In an operation which lasted 
several hours, the US forces uncovered dozens of Kalashnikov assault 
rifles, grenades, mortars, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and even 
a World War I vintage rifle in different parts of the factory complex. 
The marines also found several chemical protection suits, which might 
be expected in this type of plant, but decided to call in experts 
to determine their function. On Saturday marines had found in Nasiriyah 
some 800 grenadas, more than 15,000 rounds of rifle and machine-gun 
ammunition, mines, 300 mortar bombs of different calibres and artillery 
shells, the Qatar-based US Central Command said. In a separate raid 
the same day, US-British Coalition spokesmen in the Gulf also said 
that marines had discovered more than 300 chemical protection suits, 
as many gas masks, plus doses of atropine, an antidote for mustard 
gas, and decontamination vehicles in an operation at Nasiriyah. But 
so far the coalition forces have come across none of the chemical 
and biological weapons whose alleged possession by Iraq was a key 
reason for their invasion. ef-bl/mb Iraq-war-US-marines-weapons

China's second largest mobile phone operator China Unicom said Tuesday 
its 2002 net profit rose 2.5 percent to 4.57 billion yuan (557 million 
US dollars) from the previous 12-month period. The result was in line 
with market expectations. Analysts polled by financial newswire AFX-Asia 
said they predicted a net profit of 4.5-4.7 billion yuan. Sales soared 
38.05 percent to 40.58 billion yuan from 29.39 billion yuan earlier 
and operating profit rose to 7.78 billion yuan from 2.38 billion yuan. 
Unicom will pay a dividend of 0.10 yuan a share, the company said 
in a statement. The Hong Kong-listed firm provides cellular services 
in 21 Chinese provinces. China Unicom's bigger rival China Mobile 
(HK) Ltd. last month said it would pay a fifth of earnings to shareholders 
after reporting a net profit of 32.7 billion yuan. Shares in China 
Unicom closed unchanged at 4.28 Hong Kong dollars on Tuesday. bur/pl/dv

A state prosecutor requested a life sentence Tuesday against an animal 
rights activist who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader Pim 
Fortuyn in a political murder that shook the Netherlands. "This was 
a murder of the freedom of speech," said prosecutor Koos Plooy in 
his closing argument on the third day of the trial. He said the murder, 
just days before a general election last year in which Fortuyn's party 
was tipped to score impressive gains, deserved "unique sentence". 
"Whoever hits the heart of the democratic process must be severely 
punished," he told the court. Fortuyn supporters in the public gallery 
cheered when Plooy announced he would seek life imprisonment. Van 
der Graaf, 33, confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. 
The assassination of the populist, anti-immigrant politician last 
May stunned the country, which had seen no other political murder 
in its recent history. gdh/sb/ns Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial-prosecutor

The Hungarian economy grew by 3.3 percent in the whole of last year 
and accelerated to show growth of 3.7 percent in the last quarter 
on a 12-month comparison, official data showed on Tuesday. GDP grew 
by 2.9 percent in the first quarter, 3.1 percent in the second one 
and 3.5 percent in the third one. In 2001 the economy grew by 3.8 
percent. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the GDP growth was 3.3 percent 
compared to the fourth quarter of 2000. The data from the Central 
Statistical Bureau said that output last year amounted to 16.980 trillion 
forints (68.74 billion euros, 74.8 billion dollars) at current prices. 
Gross domestic product per capita was 1.671 million forints (6,876 
euros at the annual average rate of the central National Bank of Hungary), 
it added. In 2001 the GDP totalled 14.900 trillion forints (41 billion

The European Commission on Tuesday sent its condolences to the families 
of seven Iraqi women and chldren shot dead by US troops at a checkpoint 
in central Iraq, saying too many civilians were being killed in the 
US-led invasion. "Too many civilians have already lost their lives 
in this war," a spokesman for the European Union's executive arm told 
reporters. "This is a horrible and tragic incident. We send our condolences 
to the families," the spokesman said, adding the Commission hoped 
there would "not be any other incidents of this type". "This is not 
an isolated incident," he continued. "It shows that however advanced 
the technology is, there is no war without the loss of innocent life." 
The Commission urged the warring parties to "show restraint towards 
civilians". The civilian shooting occurred on Monday at a checkpoint 
at Najaf, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of Baghdad, manned by soldiers 
from the US Army's Third Infantry Division. Iraqi officials say hundreds 
of civilians have been killed and wounded since the start of the war 
13 days ago. Hospital officials said US and British bombing killed 
six more Iraqis and wounded dozens of others in a residential neighbourhood 
of Baghdad on Monday. While Iraqi officials said Tuesday 18 people 
had been killed and more than 100 wounded in air strikes on Baghdad 
since late Monday. Residents of Janabiyah, a village on the edge of 
the Iraqi capital, said 20 civilians, 11 of them children, were killed 
when US and British missiles hit five sleeping families at a farm 
there on Saturday night. AFP journalists have witnessed five such 
incidents in which civilians were the main victims of a US-British 
strike, reporting at least 70 dead and dozens of wounded. On Friday 
bombing from an unconfirmed source hit a market in a working-class 
neighbourhood of Baghdad, killing 30 people dead and wounding 47 others.

Vietnam on Tuesday denied restricting the freedom of the leader of 
a dissident Buddhist church and said the elderly cleric was free to 
leave the capital. "These are false allegations," said Phan Thuy Thanh, 
foreign ministry spokeswoman, referring to accusations from the Paris-based 
International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB). IBIB said Saturday 
that Quang, 86, who recently underwent surgery to remove a tumour 
feared to be cancerous at a hospital in Hanoi, had been refused permission 
to leave the capital despite issuing a six-point statement asking 
for his immediate release. "The government does not prevent M. Quang 
to leave Hanoi," the spokeswoman said, adding that Quang was currently 
visiting the Vietnamese capital. Quang has been under effective house 
arrest since 1982 near the Quang Phuoc Pagoda in the remote central 
province of Quang Ngai. According to the IBIB, Vietnam is pressuring 
the patriarch of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) 
to move to the Nguyen Thieu Monastery in Binh Dinh Province, 160 kilometres 
(99.5 miles) from Quang Ngai. "This is part of a long-running government 
campaign to transfer Thich Huyen Quang to the remote province of Binh 
Dinh and maintain him under effective house arrest, whilst claiming 
that he has been released," the organization said. But Thanh said 
Quang was not under house arrest. "M. Huyen Quang can enjoy normal 
activities in Quang Phuoc pagoda," she said, denying the government 
had received a letter from the religious leader. The UBCV has been 
banned in Vietnam since 1981, when the sole Buddhist organisation 
allowed in the country, the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, was established.

Two US pilots escaped with minor injuries when they ejected moments 
before their tanker aircraft slid off a carrier, the navy's Fifth 
Fleet said Tuesday. The pilots of the S-3B Viking airborne refuelling 
plane received minor injuries when it slid off the deck of the USS 
Constellation about 0210 GMT, said a news release received aboard 
the Kitty Hawk, another carrier engaged in bombing missions over Iraq. 
"Shortly after touching down on the deck, the S-3B malfunctioned while 
taxiing on the carrier's flight deck and slid to the port side of 
the deck," the release said. "The plane went over the side, hit flight 
deck safety netting and the two pilots onboard ejected into the water. 
The plane then went into the water," it said. A Seahawk helicopter, 
on standby in case of a flight accident, dropped a rescue swimmer 
into the water to retrieve the pilots. The frigate USS Thach, also 
nearby in case of an emergency, sent a boat to the scene. "Cause of 
the S-3B malfunction is under investigation," the release said. The 
S-3Bs, also performing a refuelling role aboard the Kitty Hawk, are 
to be phased out and their tanking job taken over by the new F/A-18 
Super Hornet attack fighters, a pilot has said. it/kir Iraq-US-navy-eject

India alerted all its international airports Tuesday to screen passengers 
for symptoms of a deadly respiratory virus which has killed more than 
60 people across the globe, officials said. "An alert has been issued 
to all immigration authorities and airlines to spot passengers with 
symptoms of the disease and quarantine them," Sudhir Kumar, director 
of the airport in India's financial capital Bombay, told AFP. "All 
passengers arriving from the 15 identified countries are being monitored 
and anyone spotted with the symptoms will be segregated," he said. 
The steps were taken following a directive from the health ministry 
in New Delhi Kumar said. "Close monitoring of all the international 
airports, especially Bombay and New Delhi is being done," he added. 
The mystery illness -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) -- 
has infected more than 1,900 people across the world. SARS first erupted 
in southern China in November but has now spread to possibly more 
than 20 countries, mainly by airline passengers. On Monday, a meeting 
of health, aviation and transport ministry officials convened by Health 
Minister Sushma Swaraj decided air and sea travellers coming from 
affected countries would have to fill a special form to help officials 
identify whether they were infected or not. Anyone suspected to be 
infected will be reported to the National Institute of Communicable 
Diseases, a health ministry statement said. jds-er/an/cl Health-pneumonia-India

All sides in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) war agreed Tuesday, 
at the final session of talks aimed at ending the country's four-year 
conflict, to set up a transitional government to lead to the first 
democratic elections in 40 years. "You are making history," the chairman 
of the talks, Sir Ketumile Masire, told delegates as the parley opened 
at the luxury casino resort of Sun City, some 150 kilometres (90 miles) 
northwest of Pretoria. The approximately 360 delegates attending the 
final session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue adopted by acclamation 
agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year, providing 
for a two-year transition government culminating in the DRC's first 
democratic elections since those on independence from Belgium in 1960. 
They also adopted a constitution, which was agreed on March 6. Delegates 
from the DRC government, rebel movements and political opposition 
on Tuesday morning went into the final plenary session of the marathon 
peace process, which began 14 months ago, and within ten minutes had 
approved the new constitution and transition government. The approved 
documents constitute the final act of the DRC peace process, which 
will be officially signed here on Wednesday at the closing ceremony 
of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue -- the talks' official name -- in 
the presence of some 10 African state leaders. The signing will be 
televised to viewers in the DRC, where the four-year war has claimed 
some 2.5 million lives, either directly through fighting or indirectly 
through famine and illness, according to United Nations estimates.

Two women now being treated in Indonesian hospitals are suspected 
to have Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Health Minister 
Achmad Suyudi said Tuesday. The cases, if confirmed, would be the 
first within the country. Suyudi said one woman had been transferred 
from a hospital at Pluit in North Jakarta to another hospital which 
he has designated to treat SARS patients. "We suspect that she might 
be suffering from SARS but we have to wait for the incubation period," 
he said. The minister said the woman had been in contact with someone 
from Singapore but gave no details. Suyudi said hospital doctors at 
Batam island near Singapore were monitoring the condition of an Indonesian 
woman who had worked in the city-state as a domestic helper. "We are 
waiting for the 10-day incubation period. She is now in her second 
day of treatment," the health minister said. He said he would issue 
an order Thursday forcing people either suffering from SARS, or suspected 
to be infected, to undergo hospital treatment. Two Indonesians outside 
the country are known to have contracted the disease. A 17-year-old 
Indonesian student in Singapore has contracted SARS after visiting 
the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and Hong Kong with his 
brother and parents. And a female Indonesian worker is in hospital 
in Hong Kong. Suyudi was speaking after a meeting at the office of 
top welfare minister Yusuf Kalla on ways to guard against the potentially 
deadly infection. Suyudi said the government was importing face masks 
from China and the United States. Indonesia has no confirmed cases 
so far despite its proximity to Singapore, which has 92 reported cases 
including four deaths. The immigration department said its staff, 
who were wearing masks, were watching arriving passengers at air and 
sea ports for any symptoms. Incoming passengers must fill in a health 
form. "Any suspicious cases will be set apart by quarantine officials 
and if they are ascertained to be carrying the disease, we will deport 
them to their country of departure as the law stipulates," said department 
spokesman Ade Endang Dahlan. The number of ferry passengers between 
Batam and nearby Singapore has fallen by some 40 percent, the state 
Antara news agency said. Authorities and hoteliers in Batam distributed 
thousands of masks. The health ministry has opened special phone lines 
for inquiries and briefed hospitals across the country on the disease.

Several people were wounded when a US warplane attacked two Iraqi 
buses carrying international volunteers, some of them American, who 
were operating as "human shields", Information Minister Mohammad Said 
al-Sahhaf said Tuesday. Sahhaf said the incident took place Monday 
in the western town of Rutba between Baghdad to neighbouring Jordan.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regrets the shooting 
of Iraqi civilians at a checkpoint and hopes that US troops took "all 
the necessary measures" to warn them, a spokeswoman said here on Tuesday. 
Antonella Notari, of the ICRC, said civilians must be spared as much 
as possible, though added that military authorities have the right 
to try to ensure the safety of their staff and to stop and search 
vehicles. "We hope that they took all the necessary measures to warn 
the people, to clearly alert them," she told reporters. US troops 
shot dead seven women and children at a checkpoint near the central 
Iraqi city of Najaf, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on 
Monday afternoon, US officials said on Tuesday. US military officials 
in Qatar said the vehicle had not stopped at the checkpoint despite 
the US troops reportedly firing warning shots. Two other people in 
the vehicle were wounded, while four escaped unharmed. A US field 
commander told AFP that, with US soldiers on edge after a suicide 
car bomb attack on Saturday that killed four comrades, the unit that 
opened fire on the minibus had respected their rules of engagement. 
"Checkpoints have, of course, the right to try and defend their own 
security and the security of their personnel so they may search vans, 
they may stop vehicles, there are certain rules on how you proceed 
in that," Notari said. "I can't comment on what exactly happened on 
the spot, I can only deeply regret that again they were civilians 
who were hit," she added. ICRC would not comment on incidents in the 
field, she insisted to reporters. "We are not witnesses to all of 
this, we cannot be the arbitrator on who is doing what in the field 
when we are not even present," she added. The Geneva-based organisation 
has 14 international staff in the cities of Baghdad, Basra and Arbil, 
plus local staff in other northern parts of Iraq. kjm/jlv/ns Iraq-war-ICRC

Deutsche Post World Net AG subsidiary DHL said Friday it expects China 
to become its largest market in the Asia-Pacific within two to three 
years. John Mullen, the firm's chief operating officer for the region, 
said the company's business volume in China is currently growing at 
a rate of 45-50 percent year-on-year. Mullen said DHL plans to add 
10-11 collection and distribution points in China this year and invest 
further in infrastructure and technologies in the region. DHL raised 
its interest in Air China in early March from 30 percent to 40 percent 
for an undisclosed sum, but Mullen said DHL had no immediate plans 
raise it further. The company on Tuesday launched a new corporate 
visual identity to reflect its three distinct business lines in the 
Asia-Pacific. DHL Express will be the express delivery arm, taking 
over the existing business of DHL Worldwide Express. DHL Danzas Air 
and Ocean represents the former business of Danzas Intercontiental. 
DHL Solutions will combine the contract logistics, warehousing and 
distribution operations of DHL and Danzas. bur/pl/dv HongKong-China-markets-DHL-company

It is not just England's Euro 2004 ambitions that are on the line 
against Turkey here on Wednesday. Since last summer's World Cup campaign 
ended with the failure to overcome a ten-man Brazil in the quarter-finals, 
Sven-Goran Eriksson has seen what had been a love affair with the 
nation's press, fans and football hierarchy steadily turn sour. A 
string of, at best, flat performances, has resulted in relations deteriorating 
to the point where defeat at the Stadium of Light will inevitably 
prompt a fresh wave of speculation about one or both parties initiating 
divorce proceedings. But if the pressure is getting to him, Eriksson 
does a good job of hiding it. "Why should I worry about things that 
might never happen," he said at England's training camp on Tuesday. 
"It's a waste of energy. "Turkey are a very good team but I think 
we can win. We are working for that and I'm very positive. The pressure 
is what I've had at every football game for the last 22 years." England's 
displays in group seven have undeniably been lacklustre: a fortunate 
win in Slovakia followed by a home draw with Macedonia and an unconvincing 
2-0 win over the part-timers of Liechtenstein. But Eriksson dismissed 
suggestions that his dispassionate style was transmitting itself to 
the players. "If you want someone shouting, you will have to change 
(coaches) because I'll never do that. It has never been my style and 
at my age it is not easy to change your character." For all the criticism 
he has had to endure, Eriksson has proved capable of extracting good 
performances from his players in the matches that have really mattered 
-- the 5-1 World Cup qualifying win over Germany and the win over 
Argentina in Japan being the two most obvious examples. Overcoming 
the World Cup semi-finalists and their quartet of skilled midfielders 
in particular represents a challenge of similar magnitude for Eriksson's 
side. Defeat will almost certainly condemn England to second place 
in the group and the lottery of a play-off to get to next year's finals. 
"This is another of those big games against the team that are the 
main danger to us winning the group," Eriksson said. "If you get second 
you can end up playing a very big football country so this is a big 
game for us and the players know that." Turkey's coach Senol Gunes 
is not reading too much into England's performance in Liechtenstein 
or their recent form in general. "They were playing the weakest link 
in the group and played at a very low tempo in order to concentrate 
on their game with Turkey," he said. "I'm sure they will play a different 
game against us on Wednesday." With three wins out of three, Turkey 
know that avoiding defeat will be a good result - although they will 
also be keen to wipe an unfortunate record of never having scored 
against England from the history books. "There are two strong sides 
in this group so this game could be considered as a final and if we 
can't win, a draw will be good for us," Gunes admitted. Turkey will 
be able to call on virtually all the players who clinched third place 
in last summer's World Cup while England will be bolstered by the 
return of Sol Campbell, who missed the trip to Liechtenstein with 
an Achilles injury. His return to the centre of defence will probably 
be at the expense of Gareth Southgate. Eriksson has had to contend 
with a public clamour for Everton's Wayne Rooney to be given the chance 
to start after impressing in the quarter of an hour he was afforded 
on Saturday. The England coach believes the 17-year-old did enough 
to show he is ready to grace the international stage on a regular 
basis. But he looks set to stick with Emile Heskey as the starting 
partner for his Liverpool team-mate Michael Owen. am/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR

The head of Russia's weapons agency Tuesday accused the United States 
of failing to unfreeze hundreds of millions of dollars it has promised 
to help destroy Russia's vast stock of chemical weapons. "No resources 
have been allocated by the United States, although they assumed an 
obligation," Zinovy Pak told AFP. US President George W. Bush in January 
released some 450 million dollars (412 million euros) to help Russia 
destroy its most theft-prone stocks of chemical weapons, waiving restrictions 
imposed by Congress on such aid. Washington has pledged a total of 
900 million dollars to build a chemical disarmament plant in the village 
of Shchuchye in the southern Urals region, according to British defense 
officials at a ceremony Tuesday marking the completion of a British-funded 
water pipeline due to service the new plant. "Just recently, (US President 
George W.) Bush made the decision to start construction and to provide 
resources, but nothing has happened," Pak said. "Bush and Congress 
just keep on making decisions," he said. Yet Pak said he hoped the 
new plant, which is set to be tasked with destroying around 14,000 
tonnes of chemical weapons, would be built by 2006. Russia has promised 
to destroy one percent of its 40,000-tonne stock by the end of May, 
while financing concerns have kept it from undertaking the task of 
destroying more of the stock, which includes tonnes of sarin and VX 
nerve gas. Russia has just one factory working full-time to destroy 
chemical weapons and Pak said that it had destroyed over 310 tonnes 
since starting up in mid-December. Dismantling Russia's stocks of 
military plutonium and chemical weapons has become a main focus of 
international efforts to halt proliferation. Russia's chemical weapons 
stockpile, which is the largest in the world, is seen as particularly 
susceptible to theft and sale in the corruption-tainted post-Soviet 
era. The country's partners in the Group of Eight pledged 20 billion 
dollars to deactivate its chemical and nuclear weapons during the 
G8 summit in Canada last year. Under the initiative, Washington pledged 
to come up with 10 billion dollars over 10 years, while the other 
Group of Seven nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany 
and Japan -- were asked to find another 10 billion. The British government 
has pledged 12 million pounds (17 million euros) over the next three 
years to help build infrastructure for the plant at Shchuchye. me/hm/ds

Turkish and Greek leaders will discuss the divided island of Cyprus 
on April 8 on the sidelines of a summit between Balkan countries, 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. Turkey will 
not give up its efforts to end the long-running division of Cyprus 
just because its rival Cypriot Greek and Turkish communities failed 
last month to agree on a UN plan to reunite their Mediterranean island, 
Erdogan told parliamentarians from his ruling Justice and Development 
Party. "We want to make new openings under Turkey's initiative," Erdogan 
said. Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was to visit the breakaway 
Turkish state in the north of Cyprus on Thursday to "launch the new 
steps" ahead of the planned meeting in Belgrad between Greek and Turkish 
prime and foreign ministers, Erdogan said. "I hope our efforts will 
make a positive contribution the Cyprus problem," Erdogan added. In 
Athens, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas confirmed that 
Turkey had proposed a meeting on the Cyprus question, but said it 
was not yet certain that it would take place. "Cyprus is an open issue 
for us. The meeting has not been finalised yet, but we can not rule 
out that it will take place," Protopapas told reporters, saying that 
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis would not be in Belgrade until 
April 9. A diplomatic source told AFP that Greece "viewed the proposal 
favourably," but that the meeting was "not 100-percent sure." The 
Turkish press has recently reported that Ankara was planning to look 
for a Cyprus solution outside the United Nations framework, but there 
has so far been no official confirmation of that. A last-ditch effort 
by the United Nations to reunify the island failed earlier this month 
when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash rejected the UN blueprint, 
to which the Greek Cypriots also had objections. The UN Security Council 
is expected to pass a resolution on Cyprus in the coming days, after 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reports on the plan's failure. The 
plan was largely regarded as the final chance to resolve the island's 
division before the internationally-recognized Greek Cypriot side 
joins the European Union next year. The EU has said that if there 
is no reunification deal, it will admit only the Greek Cypriots. Cyprus 
has been divided since July 1974 when Turkish troops occupied the 
northern third of the island in reponse to a Greek Cypriot coup that 
sought to unite the island with Greece. han/fc/yad Cyprus-Turkey-Greece

The Indian government, facing swelling market protests, backed off 
Tuesday from imposing a controversial tax which businesses argue will 
harm both trade and consumers. The national and state governments 
deferred plans to impose value added tax (VAT) on April 1, as many 
markets remained shut for the second day Tuesday as shop keepers protested 
the move, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said. Asim Dasgupta, Finance 
Minister of West Bengal state, said his counterparts from other Indian 
provinces would now meet on Tuesday next week to "review the situation 
and decide on the new date" for the implementation of VAT, PTI said. 
Traders say VAT is imposed on business at all levels of manufacture 
and production and so will inflate costs and harm both sellers and 
buyers. Retail and wholesale markets remained closed in several states, 
PTI said, after a call from the Confederation of All India Traders 
and another business protest forum. They exempted emergency services 
including health and transport sectors from the two-day nationwide 
shutdown. In the southern state of Kerala private buses stayed off 
roads and petrol stations and a section of the local hotel industry 
Tuesday joined the snowballing anti-VAT protests, PTI said. Even the 
bullion market and the bourse-influencing oilseeds segment joined 
the protest in the southern Tamil Nadu state, PTI said. The state 
of Karnataka has already washed its hands of VAT and said it will 
not implement the levy because of the growing anger. Uttar Pradesh, 
India's most populous state, reported medical shortages as pharmacists 
joined the strike Tuesday while in Bombay, India's commercial hub, 
the strike was near total, reports said. A majority of Bombay's wholesale 
markets including garments, tea, grains, oils remained shut and traders 
in the adjacent towns such as Nasik, Pune and Ahmednagar stayed away 
from business. "Prices of most of the essential commodities including 
tea and foodgrains, will rise if VAT is implemented as according to 
this system... which ultimately will be recovered from the consumer," 
PTI quoted a trader as saying in Bombay. pc/an/dv India-tax-protest

The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Tuesday it -- and not 
the United States -- was responsible for checking that Iraq did not 
possess any atomic weapons, after a report that Washington wanted 
to set up unilateral weapons inspections. "The IAEA is the sole body 
with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear disarmament," the head 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, 
said in a statement. "The world has learned over three decades that 
only through impartial, international inspections can credibility 
be generated. Iraq is no exception to that requirement." ElBaradei's 
comments came after the New York Times said Washington had set up 
special military units to seek out the weapons of mass destruction 
it accuses Iraq of developing. Hans Blix, the head of the UN inspection 
team responsible for verifying whether Iraq possesses any banned chemical 
and biological arms, said on Saturday that the US and London were 
trying to recruit his inspectors to work on a unilateral weapons search 
programme. "They have turned to some people who currently work for 
us and asked them to come down and help. These are our people who 
come from countries that are engaged in the conflict down there," 
Blix said. The inspection teams led by ElBaradei and Blix were evacuated 
from Iraq two days before the US-British invasion of Iraq, less than 
four months into the verification mission the United Nations Security 
Council had asked them to undertake. ElBaradei -- who on March 7 said 
UN experts had found no sign of any prohibited nuclear activity at 
any inspected site in Iraq -- said on Tuesday the weapons teams hoped 
to continue their work once the war was over. "The IAEA mandate in 
Iraq is still valid and has not changed," he said. "Our operation 
is interrupted because of hostilities. "We expect to go back with 
full authority after the cessation of hostilities, to resume our inspection 
activities in Iraq pursuant to the mandate given to us both by the 
Security Council and by the fact that Iraq is a party to the NPT (nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty) . "Impartial and independent verification 
is at the core of international efforts over the last 30 years to 
underpin the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," he continued. 
"We had made good progress since resuming inspections in Iraq in November 
and we stand ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume 
our work after the war and to provide the ongoing assurances sought 
by the Security Council that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme."

The United Nations is preparing to send human rights monitors to Iraq 
as soon as it is safe enough, a UN spokesman said on Tuesday. Staff 
were sent to Cyprus and Jordan last week ready to operate inside Iraq 
and the northern governorates, said Jose Luis Diaz, a spokesman for 
the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN has 
appealed for about 1.6 million dollars to fund the operation. "That 
is just to ensure that the response to the crisis adheres to the principles 
of accountability, non-discrimination ... and the empowerment of the 
Iraqi people," Diaz told journalists. The move was backed by the UN 
special rapporteur for human rights in Iraq, Andreas Mavrommatis. 
"One might think that it is not so appropriate, when people including 
civilians are being killed, to speak about future action in the field 
of human rights in Iraq," Mavrommatis told the annual meeting of the 
UN Human Rights Commission. "It is my view though that I would have 
been failing in my duty, if I were not to refer, in an almost optimistic 
manner, to the imperative necessity for continued action to promote 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iraq," he said. The Cypriot 
UN expert also sharply criticised coalition bombardments of Iraqi 
civilians. "What we expect now is for the war to be over the soonest 
and that events such as the carnage in the market place in Baghdad 
would not occur again," Mavrommatis said. "Respect to the right to 
life, to my mind, enjoins combatants to abort the process when the 
targeting of assets entails foreseeable risks to civilians," he added. 
A bustling Baghdad market was demolished during US-led air strikes 
on Baghdad last Friday, killing and maiming scores of civilians. pac-kjm/cr/jkb

Indian shares closed 1.06 percent higher Tuesday on active buying 
in select index heavy stocks despite ongoing worries over a prolonged 
war in Iraq, dealers said. The Bombay Stock Exchange's 30-share index 
rose 32.23 points to close at 3,080.95. Dealers said trading was volatile 
with select technology stocks like Satyam Computer facing the brunt 
of selling, although it was offset by buying in index heavy blue chips. 
They said Infosys was volatile, but the stock closed firm, in turn 
helping the index to end in positive territory. Infosys closed up 
40.05 rupees at 4,080.35, Satyam was down 3.35 at 173.60, HCL Technologies 
was up 30 at 155.25, while media stock Zee was up 3.05 at 65.55. Large 
cap Reliance closed up 5.30 at 281.75, Ranbaxy was up 0.85 at 635.25, 
State Bank was up 4.15 at 274.05, Telco was up 3.20 at 158.85, Tisco 
was up 1.55 at 135.55, Gujarat Ambuja was up 3.25 at 163.0, while 
Hindalco was up 13.30 at 547.80. "Most of the funds as well as traders 
and retail investors have bought today (Tuesday). It was a technical 
rebound after Monday's sharp losses," said a dealer with a domestic 
brokerage. Dealers said despite the gains seen Tuesday, the market 
continued to be subdued by the Iraq conflict and its duration. "The 
market is moving on a daily basis depending on what happens in Iraq. 
Any development which indicates that the war will be prolonged, pressures 
the market," said another dealer with a foreign brokerage. He said 
the market firmed Tuesday on reports that coalition forces had made 
inroads in Iraq. "But the other worry is the possibility of the conflict 
expanding to other countries such as Syria," he said. jds/an/dv Stocks-India

The Thai stock market edged down 0.64 percent Tuesday after investors 
sold off major stocks on growing fears of a prolonged war on Iraq 
and the spread of a killer virus, analysts said. The Stock Exchange 
of Thailand (SET) composite index dropped 2.33 points to close at 
362.22, while the blue chip SET 50 index was off 0.18 points at 23.45 
Advancing stocks led decliners 145 to 114, with 66 stocks unchanged 
on trade of 5.97 million lots worth 5.0 billion baht (117 million 
dollars). Kim Eng Securities head of research Pongpan Apinyakul said 
the local bourse declined on selling in major stocks due to concerns 
over the spread of SARS and lingering concerns over the US-Iraq war. 
Another dealer with a foreign brokerage said the local bourse came 
off its low with late buying in financial and communication stocks 
on hope of a rebound on Wall Street later Tuesday, following a slight 
rise in Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The SET index also rebounded 
on technical factors after testing support at the 358-360 points level, 
he said. Among major stocks, PTT Exploration and Production lost 7.00 
baht to close at 122.00 and PTT fell 0.75 baht to 44.75. National 
Finance added 0.40 baht to 12.00, Kiatnakin Finance fell 0.75 baht 
to 25.00 and Bangkok Bank was flat at 54.00. Siam Cement fell 18.00 
baht to 1,256.00, TPI Polene lost 0.60 to finish at 15.00 and Shin

Zimbabwe's opposition, which gave President Robert Mugabe's government 
until Monday, to take urgent steps to resolve political and economic 
crises, has yet to decide how to act now that the ultimatum has passed 
unheeded, the party spokesman said Tuesday. Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC) spokesman Paul Temba Nyathi said that given that the 
government has ignored 15 demands it made, warning of mass action, 
party officials would meet to decide on when and how to respond. "We 
as a party will choose our time, place and mode to respond to that 
failure," Nyathi said. The MDC issued an ultimatum to Mugabe two weeks 
ago after it organised a widely followed anti-government strike, calling 
on the long-time leader to take concrete steps towards political and 
economic reforms in Zimbabwe by March 31 or face more protests. Nyathi 
said the pressure is on the government to respond to the demands in 
the ultimatum, hinging on political and economic reform. The MDC said 
at the weekend his party's supporters had the right to protest peacefully 
and warned the government to soon expect a "final push that will restore 
our sovereignty, liberty and freedom." Meantime, the MDC vice president 
Gibson Sibanda, who was arrested Monday for alleged trying to "subvert" 
a constitutionally elected government arising from his role in the 
two-day national strike last month, spent the night in jail. He was 
to appear before a magistrate court Tuesday. sn/stb/nb Zimbabwe-opposition

BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could 
hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Thursday, a diplomatic source in the Belgian capital told 
AFP. In Athens, Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas, whose 
country holds the EU presidency, confirmed that Powell had asked to 
formally meet the EU's foreign policy chiefs, followed by an informal 
gathering with the foreign ministers of the Union's 15 member states 
and those of NATO. According to Protopapas, Powell asked to formally 
meet EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana, the EU Commissioner for 
External Relations Chris Patten and Greek Foreign Minister George 
Papandreou, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. "We do 
not object to that meeting, it will most likely take place," Protopapas 
said. "It would have been better if it had taken place before the 
war began, but it's never too late." Powell is set to arrive in Turkey 
later on Tuesday for discussions on the US-led war on Iraq. He will 
then travel on to Brussels for talks on Thursday with NATO and EU 
officials. He will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, 
according to the Russian foreign ministry. The US State Department 
has said Powell hopes to discuss issues related to the invasion of 
Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the post-war future of the oil-rich 
country. He could raise in Brussels the possibility of involving countries 
other than the United States and Britain in stabilising Iraq and maintaining 
order after the end of the war. Washington's strategy in Iraq has 
deeply divided its European partners and put strains on transatlantic 
relations. But the 15 EU members agreed at a summit on March 20-21 
that the United Nations should play a central role in Iraq during 
and after the war. European calls for a UN-supervised administration 
in Iraq are becoming more strident, amid concerns that Washington 
may cut non-US companies out of reconstruction contracts in Iraq.

Italian police said Tuesday they had arrested four men in northern 
Italy suspected of links to an Islamic extremist organisation. A police 
spokesman declined to give details of the arrests, but newspapers 
reported that four men of Middle Eastern origin had been arrested 
on suspicion of links to the Iraq-based Ansar al-Islam. The men, arrested 
in overnight swoops in Milan and Parma, were reported to be under 
police surveillance for around a year and preparing to leave Italy 
when they were arrested. Investigators told the ANSA news agency those 
arrested are suspected of recruiting dozens of Iraqi and Kurdish volunteers 
to fight invading US and British forces in Iraq. They are being held 
on anti-terrorism charges introduced in Italy following the September 
11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Up to eight others suspected 
of links to the Islamic group are being investigated as part of the 
ongoing operation, according to a judicial source. Meanwhile, Italian 
prosecutors have decided to drop terrorism charges against five Moroccans 
arrested near the northern city of Rovigo in January. Venice magistrate 
Felice Casson said the five would only be charged with the possession 
of an illegal explosive, and that the more serious charges would be 
dropped. Their lawyer, Sofia Tengo, was due to lodge a demand for 
their immediate release on Tuesday. clr-ljm/db/ns Iraq-war-Italy-arrests

A new trade accord between the European Union (EU) and 78 partner 
nations in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACP) took effect 
Tuesday, as parliamentarians from countries concerned met here. "The 
Cotonou Agreement has entered a new phase," Glenys Kinnock, the EU 
co-chair of the ACP-EU parliamentary grouping told the fifth session 
of the joint assembly, which began work in Congo's capital Brazzaville 
on Monday. The agreement is primarily an economic pact in the wake 
of previous pacts, but the accord now stresses respect for human rights, 
conflict prevention and resolution, and good and open management of 
public funds. The parliamentarians gathered in the central African 
country are set to assess progress in economic partnership talks since 
the Cotonou Agreement was first signed in June 2000. The multi-billion 
euro pact takes effect as of April 1 following ratification by all 
EU member states and most of the nations in the ACP grouping. Further 
negotiations began in September last year and have two aspects: overall 
talks between the EU and the ACP as a whole, and more specific discussions 
between European countries and nations in different regions. "These 
negotiations are extremely difficult," said a document released to 
the media by the ACP secretariat. "There are deep divisions between 
the ACP and the EU on matters of substance such as finalising the 
first phase of negotiations which should involve the whole of the 
ACP," it added. "For us, it's important that this first phase gathers 
in the whole of the ACP and that the EU makes firm commitments to 
follow up on negotiations with each ACP region," ACP spokesman Hegel 
Goutier said. "The European Union reckons that at this stage, it's 
simply a matter of clarifications," he said. Differences have also 
arisen on means of strengthening the capacity of ACP member nations 
to be competitive for "a gradual penetration of the international 
market," Goutier told AFP. "Since there are plans to scrap the non-reciprocal 
trade preferences we benefit from, the ACP countries need to be compensated 
regarding their export products." Such preferences allowed the free 
entry on to European markets without customs duties of ACP products 
such as sugar and bananas, but the Cotonou accord puts an end to them 
and authorises third-party exports to the EU. ACP countries are also 
seeking a reform of the rules set down by the World Trade Organisation," 
Goutier said. "For us, WTO rules are not fair and transparent. They 
need to be reformed. Our EU partners consider that these rules are 
flexible. On all these issues are EU partners are not being flexible." 
Congo's President Denis Sassou Nguesso urged negotiators to "conclude 
positively, in the interests of each party," saying it was a matter 
of "strengthening access to markets by ACP products, so that the ACP 
and the EU have an impact on WTO regulations." The Cotonou Agreement 
is valid for 20 years and open to revision every five years. It is 
the successor to the Lome Conventions that previously regulated EU-ACP 
cooperation. The accord provides for a first budgetary envelope of 
20 billion euros (21.7 billion dollars) covering the first five years 
of trade. jg-bbos/nb Congo-ACP-EU-trade

As US-led forces Tuesday bombarded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
main palace complex, spare a thought for the German architect who 
says he designed a multi-million-dollar bunker buried deep underneath 
it. Karl Bernd Esser claims on his company's Internet website that 
the bunker, built in 1982 to the highest specifications, has a total 
area of 1,800 square metres (19.370 square feet). It cost 66 million 
dollars to build, but proved its worth in the 1991 Gulf War, withstanding 
aerial bombardment. The website of the company he works for, Sheltex, 
shows pictures said to be of a command centre in the bunker as well 
as the presidential bedroom, part of the air-conditioning system and 
a hideaway. Esser told Germany's ZDF television in a recent report 
that the walls were three metres thick, could withstand temperatures 
up to 300 degrees Celsius and survive anything short of a direct hit 
from a nuclear weapon the size of that which destroyed Hiroshima. 
Two underground passages lead directly to the Tigris river. Esser 
was not immediately contactable Tuesday, but told ZDF that he had 
no regrets about designing the bunker for the Iraqi leader. "Bunkers 
don't shoot people," he said. "It is a secure living space to NATO 
standards and bomb-proof." At the time the facility was built Saddam 
was not seen as the ogre the United States depicts him as today -- 
in fact, the West saw him as a counterweight to the fundamentalist 
Iranian regime next door. The Sheltex website claims it plans, builds 
and delivers bunkers worldwide and is the only company supplying them 
to NATO, US, German, Swedish and Swiss standards. The site includes 
a design for a two-level bunker of 400 square metres and capable of 
holding 60 to 90 people. It could withstand a direct hit by a conventional 
250-kilogram bomb, while protecting its occupants from the effects 
of a nuclear, chemical or biological attack, the accompanying text 
explains. The design shows air-conditioning systems, self-sufficient 
water and power supplies, living space including a kitchen, dining 
room, toilets and showers, an emergency exit, a command and control 
room and a decontamination suite. km/loc/ds Iraq-war-Baghdad-bunker

Six Germans have gone missing in Algeria's Sahara desert, diplomats 
said Tuesday, bringing to 17 the number of tourists reported to have 
disappeared without trace in the north African country since late 
February. The six Germans, four men and two women, were touring the 
southern Algerian desert in three, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Their 
relatives have said they are "very worried" about the group after 
they had no word from the six tourists since a phone call on March 
17, the diplomats said. The last time the group contacted their families 
was from the southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset, 1,900 kilometers 
(1,140 miles) south of Algiers, the diplomats said. Algerian officials 
have not confirmed the group's disappearance. On February 21, 11 European 
tourists -- six Germans, four Swiss and one Dutch -- went missing 
in southeastern Algeria, near the border with Niger and Libya. Those 
tourists were travelling in three distinct groups: the Germans in 
two groups -- one with four motorbikes and the second using two bikes 
and including the Dutch national -- and the Swiss in a separate group 
travelling in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The two groups travelling 
on motorcycles were last seen in Djanet, some 1,500 kilometres (930 
miles), southeast of Algiers, and were travelling north to Ouargla, 
via Illizi about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of Djanet. The four 
Swiss were travelling in the opposite direction, heading south from 
Ouargla to Illizi, close to the border with Libya. The official Algerian 
news agency, APS, only confirmed the disappearance of the three groups 
on March 17. Despite the use of helicopters with heat-seeking equipment 
to search the vast, remote desert, where it was feared the tourists 
could have been buried with their vehicles in a sandstorm, no trace 
has been found of the three groups of tourists. "Eleven people with 
vehicles and all their stuff, that leaves traces. They can't just 
vanish into thin air," said a diplomat of the first disappearances. 
Bands of smugglers are known to roam Algeria's southern Sahara, where 
they traffic in contraband across the porous borders with Niger and 
Libya. Many of the smugglers, as well as arms and drugs traffickers 
who operate in the area, have ties to a group of Islamic extremists 
in the area, led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar. That group's threats a few 
years ago to attack competitors in the Paris-Dakar rally forced the 
event's organisers to change the race's itinerary. Newspapers in Algeria 
recently reported that Belmokhtar's group had joined forces with the 
Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), one of two armed Muslim 
fundamentalist groups which have waged an insurgency in Algeria since 
1992, in which around 150,000 people have died. The GSPC and the Armed 
Islamic Group (GIA) rejected an amnesty offered in 1999 by President 
Abdelaziz Bouteflika to all Muslim fighters who had not been directly 
involved in killings. The GSPC, which has ties to the al-Qaeda terrorist 
network, operates mostly in Algeria's northeastern Kabylie province 
and generally restricts its attacks to members of the security forces.

The Indian government said Tuesday it will provide an "escort service" 
to its software professionals to guide them on visa regulations after 
a recent spate of arrests abroad. "One must be very scrupulous with 
the visas," Minister for Communications and Information Technology 
Arun Shourie told reporters here. "The IT ministry along with the 
National Association of Software and Service Companies (India's premier 
IT lobby) will jointly provide an escort service to every software 
professional who is going out to such countries as Germany and the 
Netherlands," Shourie said. "Our ministry will work with the industry 
on what the visa requirements are in different countries and tell 
them to obey scrupulously," he said. "India's IT is a house set on 
a hill. So many people would want to get rid of us." A week ago authorities 
in the Netherlands and in London arrested several employees of Bombay-based 
information technology firm, I-flex on alleged visa irregularities. 
India said the arrests were unwarranted and smacked of "economic protectionism." 
Earlier in March Malaysian authorities arrested 270 Indian software 
engineers over alleged visa irregularities, while last year top officials 
of Polaris Software India Ltd. were detained in Indonesia. The incidents 
sparked outrage in India and the foreign ministry took up the cases. 
The Malaysian acting prime minister personally apologised for the 
incident. "There are visa requirements and everything should be in 
perfect order. In Malaysia the police action was triggered by false 
information," Shourie said. Shourie said India's software industry 
was best in the world but cheap manpower being exported outside for 
software development and research was hurting the employment of other 
nations. "The work that we do impacts on the jobs elsewhere just as 
imports from other countries will cut on jobs here. So, if Chinese 
batteries come (to India) we start shouting (to) put an embargo, put 
anti-dumping duty. "When we want to take advantage of free trade, 
we have to be for free trade in all services and commodities. We have 
to be strong and competitive so that everybody will listen to us," 
Shourie said. Shourie said the Iraq war could provide opportunities 
for Indian software companies. "I think we should see opportunities 
in these difficult times. If there is a recession worldwide, there 
will be lesser demand for these services. But the more recessionary 
the conditions in the West, more western firms will have to go for 
cost-cutting measures. "That is where they will give work to countries 
like India," he said. jay/an/dv India-IT

Japan retracted an announcement by its defence agency on Tuesday that 
North Korea had test-fired another missile, amid high tensions over 
the Stalinist state's suspected nuclear programme. Japan's naval chief 
of staff Koichi Furusho said Japan had confirmed that North Korea 
had fired a short-range anti-ship missile into the Yellow Sea after 
launching two similar missiles into the Sea of Japan in the past five 
weeks. The announcement sparked fears that North Korea was preparing 
to test a longer-range ballistic missile that could hit Japan or possibly 
reach part of the United States. But after a blunt denial by South 
Korea of any missile launch by the North, Japanese officials backtracked, 
saying they were still trying to confirm reports of a launch. "We 
owe you many apologies for it but we make a correction," Shoei Yamanaka, 
chief of the defence agency's secretariat, told a press conference 
later. "We are in the middle of confirming information, including 
the missile launch. We will have to make a clear answer based on confirmed 
facts," he added. A defence agency spokesman said the information 
had not come from one of Japan's new spy satellites, launched last 
week amid strong protests from Pyongyang. Those satellites will not 
be operational until the system is complete with the deployment of 
another two, he said. But he refused to disclose the source of the 
apparently erroneous information. An agency press officer said it 
was not immediately certain when Japan would be able to confirm the 
launch or non-launch. "We cannot tell if it will be made by the end 
of the day." Shortly after the initial Japanese announcement, South 
Korea's defense ministry issued a forceful denial that a launch had 
taken place. "Based on the result of South Korean and US military 
intelligence authorities' investigation, we confirm again there was 
no missile launch from North Korea today," a spokesman said. Military 
analysts in Seoul suggested that the test-firing of an artillery piece 
could have been confused with a missile launch. The news on the missile 
firing was announced by Land, Infrastructure and Transport minister 
Chikage Ogi at the end of a parliamentary committee session. "I just 
received a preliminary report that North Korea seems to have fired 
a surface-to-vessel missile at 10:15 am," she said. She located the 
launch site at Hwajinri in Pyongannamdo province, on the opposite 
side of the Korean peninsula from the previous launch site. The missile's 
range was put at 60 kilometres (38 miles). Speculation has been rife 
in the Japanese media that North Korea would test-fire another missile 
when Japan sent its first spy satellites into orbit last Friday, a 
move denounced by Pyongyang as a "hostile act" that could spark a 
new arms race. North Korea test-fired short-range anti-ship missiles 
on February 24 and March 10, sparking fresh fears in the region about 
its firepower. In 1998 Pyongyang test-fired a medium-range Taepodong 
ballistic missile that overflew Japan and splashed down in the Pacific. 
North Korea is believed to have deployed some 100 Rodong-1 missiles 
with a range of 1,300 kilometres (805 miles), capable of striking 
any target in Japan. Analysts have said the series of short-range 
missile tests was part of Pyongyang's game of brinkmanship aimed at 
breaking US resolve during the tense stand-off over the North's nuclear 
weapons drive. bur-mis-sps/ja/th/ds NKorea-nuclear-missile

Thai drugs war estimated to have killed more than 2,000: police by 
Thanaporn Promyamyai ATTENTION - ADDS rights commission quote, attorney-general's 
complaint /// BANGKOK, April 1 (AFP) - The estimated death toll in 
Thailand's brutal drugs crackdown has risen to more than 2,000, police 
said Tuesday as the kingdom entered the third month of a self-declared 
war on methamphetamines. A total of 2,052 people have been murdered 
across the country since the drugs war began February 1, including 
46 people who police have shot dead in self-defence, national Thai 
police spokesman Pongsapat Pongcharoen said in a statement. Six police 
officers were killed over the same period, while 15 were injured, 
he said. "The police chief is satisfied with the results over the 
past two months," Pongsapat said. While police are unable to say precisely 
how many of the killings were drugs-related, the national murder tally 
has been widely used as a proxy figure for the number of deaths resulting 
from the no-holds-barred drugs war. Authorities have repeatedly said 
that the remainder of the murders were carried out by drug gang members 
in a bid to protect themselves from prosecution. Drug-related arrests 
over the period now totalled 46,776, while police seized 12.51 million 
methamphetamine tablets and 641 million baht (14.94 million dollars) 
worth of property belonging to suspected traffickers, Pongsapat said. 
Separately, 182 arrests of murder suspects had been made, he said. 
"For the third month, police will focus on the arrests of big drugs 
traders and investigate further to see whether they can seize property 
believed to belong to those involved in the drugs business," he added. 
Thirapat Assawasangsit, secretary to the National Human Rights Commissioner 
who oversees drugs issues, told AFP the new toll showed that the situation 
in Thailand was "very scary". "In any particular country if there 
are over 2,000 murder cases in two months, then that is something 
horrible," he said. "And police so far haven't come up with anything 
solid -- they haven't arrested (many of) the culprits yet. It's a 
very scary situation." Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is spearheading 
the war on drugs, aimed at stamping out the rampant methamphetamine 
trade here, most of which flows in from neighbouring Myanmar. The 
crackdown has attracted criticism from a range of rights groups concerned 
about allegations of extra-judicial killings and questionable official 
blacklists of suspects. A report Tuesday cited the deputy attorney-general 
Praphan Naiyakowit complaining that police had not passed any case 
details on to a committee he heads which is charged with overseeing 
extra-judicial cases. The committee was set up by the government in 
response to the criticism it received in the early days of the blitz. 
"Until now I have not received any murder reports for February and 
March. The attorney-general has set up ten smaller committees (to 
investigate this) but they have not been able to investigate anything 
because they have to wait for details of the cases," he told the Thai-language 
Thai Post newspaper. The national police office was supposed to submit 
details of the cases by March 28, he reportedly said. Thailand is 
the world's largest per capita consumer of methamphetamines, according 
to the International Narcotics Control Board. tp-sb/hw/ds Thailand-drugs

German officials said Tuesday that they had smashed a people-smuggling 
racket based in the northern city of Hamburg after a series of dawn 
raids. By midday (1000 GMT) some 400 police and border officials had 
raided 24 homes in Hamburg and detained 34 people, although some were 
thought to have been released later. Among those detained were the 
10 alleged ringleaders of the Algerian-led network. Police also seized 
1,000 documents now being examined, and border police spokesman Ruediger 
Carstens predicted more searches and arrests. The interior ministry 
said earlier that the network was believed to have set up in Hamburg 
in October last year and to have links in Belgium, France, Italy, 
Portugal and Spain as well as Algeria. Also raided in Tuesday's swoops 
was a workshop where documents were being forged or altered, a discovery 
which Carstens said was of "especially high value" to investigators. 
Around 800 forged, doctored or stolen documents were found in the 
workshop, including passports, credit cards and proof-of-tax certificates, 
as well as 20,000 euros (dollars) in cash. Investigators believe the 
documents were sold in the north African region for up to 2,000 euros 
apiece. They said it was not clear how many illegal immigrants the 
network may have smuggled into Germany or other EU states. km/loc/ns

Hong Kong sets up quarantine camps as rumours prompt panic-buying 
by Huw Watkin = (PICTURES) = HONG KONG, April 1 (AFP) - Authorities 
moved to set up special quarantine camps in an effort to contain a 
deadly viral epidemic here Tuesday, as rumours the former British 
colony would be declared an "infected area" prompted panic-buying 
by an increasingly nervous population. As the death toll climbed to 
16 and the number of reported infections of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) soared by 75 to 685 Tuesday, a Web site report saying 
Hong Kong would be declared an "infected area" prompted a run on supermarkets. 
The continuing SARS epidemic -- driven by an as-yet-unidentified virus 
which causes a pneumonia-like disease -- had significantly reduced 
the number of people on the streets of this usually crowded city, 
but Tuesday's rumour created scenes that one long-term resident described 
as "unprecedented". "I was shopping early in the afternoon and the 
place was jam-packed. We waited in a supermarket queue for what was 
easily an hour," he said. "I wouldn't say it was panic, but people 
were certainly very tense and buying large quantities of food and 
water. Everybody was wearing face masks and many people were clearly 
agitated." The Hong Kong government later dismissed the report -- 
which coincided with April Fool's Day and reportedly appeared on the 
Web site of the popular Chinese-language Ming Pao newspaper -- as 
bogus. "I would like to take this opportunity ... to inform the people 
of Hong Kong categorically that we have no plan and there is no need 
for us to declare Hong Kong as an infected area," said Director of 
Health Margaret Chan. " ... our airport and all our external transport 
with other parts of the world will continue as usual. Everything is 
running as scheduled and normally," she said. Ming Pao later denied 
responsibility for the report, saying it had taken the matter to police 
and that it reserved the right to take legal action against what it 
described as "a hacker". P.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's deputy director of 
health, meanwhile said that hundreds of people confined for 10 days 
Monday under emergency quarantine measures to a 33-storey residential 
complex on Hong Kong's Kowloon peninsula would now be transferred 
to two government-run holiday camps. "As cases of atypical pneumonia 
continue to rise ... we have arranged for the residents to be transferred 
temporarily to two holiday camps to reside there until the end of 
their isolation period," he said. Leung did not specify the exact 
number of people involved in the quarantine transfer, but a health 
department spokeswoman told AFP earlier Tuesday there were only some 
240 residents in 108 units when the order was put in place. She said 
that authorities had little information on the whereabouts of tenants 
from another 156 units who have reportedly fled, prompting fears the 
quarantine move would have little effect in slowing the epidemic's 
spread. Health authorities told reporters Monday that investigations 
by Hong Kong University had discovered the virus could be detected 
in the faeces of patients. He said the authorities were studying if 
the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens residential complex was related to 
a waste-water mains at the estate which had recently burst. The public 
housing estate was sealed late Monday by around 50 police officers 
wearing white masks who set up barricades around the buildings. The 
measure was taken after 185 residents in the block came down with 
the flu-like symptoms of SARS, including 64 who were diagnosed on 
Monday. hw/th Health-pneumonia-HongKong

David Beckham says England face their biggest match since the 2002 
World Cup quarter-final defeat to Brazil when they tackle Turkey in 
Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier. Sven-Goran Eriksson's side go into 
the match two points adrift of World Cup semi-finalists Turkey who 
top group seven with three wins out of three. "We've had some big 
games since (the Brazil game) but none as big as this one," the England 
captain told SKY TV Tuesday. "It's the biggest game of the group, 
especially for us - they've been playing well. They're top of the 
group and they've got nothing to lose. "We said that at the start 
of the week - everyone was talking about the Turkey game being the 
big one and we're all up for it." The Manchester United star admitted 
England played badly in beating the Liechtenstein part-timers 2-0 
last Saturday. "The Liechtenstein game could have been a dreadful 
banana skin. But we came out of there with three points. We were on 
a no-win thing," he said. England's displays in group seven have been 
a fortunate 2-0 win in Slovakia followed by a home draw with Macedonia 
and a 2-0 win over Liechtenstein. Turkey beat Slovakia 3-0, Macedonia 
2-1 and Liechtenstein 5-0. bur/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Beckham

There has been no increase in attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan 
since the start of the Iraq war, a US military spokesman said Tuesday, 
while announcing that two US bases had come under rocket attack in 
the country's south. Despite several recent incidents, Colonel Roger 
King said there had not been an "upswing" in attacks since the start 
of the US-led war in Iraq two weeks ago. "We looked at previous attacks 
on coalition forces during the last half of the months of November 
2002, and January and compared them to the last two weeks of march 
following the start of operations in Iraq," he told reporters at Bagram 
Air Base 50 kilometres (31 miles) north of Kabul. "The number of recent 
attacks shows no increase outside of the norm." King said there were 
17 attacks during the last two weeks of March compared with 34 attacks 
in the last 15 days of November and 22 in the second half of January. 
Overall, there were 27 attacks in March, compared with the worst month 
of November which saw 55 attacks. Meanwhile two US bases came under 
rocket attack near the main southern city of Kandahar on Monday, King 
said. "Two rockets were fired at Fire Base Gecko, northeast of Kandahar 
at about 3:00 pm (1030GMT) yesterday afternoon. Neither rocket struck 
the base. There were no casualties or damage to coalition assets," 
he said. A rocket was also fired at the Orgun-e base in eastern Paktika 
province at around 10:30 pm (1800 GMT) Monday, but did not cause any 
casualties or damage. In a separate incident on the same night, a 
US humvee vehicle hit an anti-tank mine on a road near Kandahar. "No 
one was injured, but the vehicle sustained extensive damage to the 
front end," King said, adding that a second mine was discovered and 
detonated. Coalition forces regularly come under attack from al-Qaeda 
and Taliban remnants. Following reports that posters and leaflets 
in the name of Mullah Omar had appeared in eastern Afghanistan, King 
said the fugitive Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar was probably 
still alive. "As I understand and the information we have gotten is 
Mullah Omar probably is alive," he said. "There are various reports 
as to where he may be at any time. The indications are he moves around 
quite a bit which is probably the safest thing for him to do if he 
wants to remain un-incarcerated." Mullah Omar and his former "guest" 
al-Qaeda terror mastermind Osama bin Laden remain at large despite 
a massive international manhunt and multimillion dollar prices on 
their heads. str-mtp/bc/rcw Afghanistan-US-attacks

Pakistan on Tuesday demanded evidence from the United States to back 
allegations that it exported nuclear technology to North Korea, following 
Washington's announcement of sanctions on North Korea and a Pakistani 
nuclear facility. "There is no evidence about what the US is saying," 
Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri told AFP, after the US imposed 
sanctions on the A.Q.Khan Research Laboratories (KRL), a uranium enrichment 
plant considered the hub of Pakistan's nuclear program. "We have already 
told them (US) that if they have any evidence...against KRL they should 
bring it forward." The sanctions -- a two-year ban on trade with US 
firms -- were imposed because of KRL's "contributions" to efforts 
by an unnamed foreign "country, person or entity of proliferation 
concern" to develop weapons of mass destruction, US State Department 
spokesman Richard Boucher said. Sanctions have also been slapped on 
North Korea for exporting missile technology, Boucher said. US officials 
have not publicy linked the two countries, but KRL is at the center 
of months of allegations by unnamed US intelligence officials that 
Pakistan helped North Korea develop its controversial nuclear weapons 
program in exchange for missiles from Pyongyang. Pakistani officials 
have vehemently denied the charges, and on Tuesday repeated their 
insistence that Pakistan has never proliferated its nuclear know-how. 
"Pakistan has neither imported nor exported this sensitive technology. 
What we have indigeously developed is solely for our defence," Information 
Minister Sheikh Rashid told AFP. He accused the US of "cold-shouldering 
a friend." "We are strongly committed to the fight against terrorism," 
he said in reference to the 18-month US-led campaign to wipe out the 
Taliban and al-Qaeda, in which Pakistan has played a crucial role. 
The sanctions were interpreted by some politicians and analysts as 
indications that the US was planning to deal with Pakistan's weapons 
of mass destruction after dealing with Iraq and other "axis of evil" 
countries. "The US and UK have invaded Iraq because it possesses weapons 
of mass destruction and both North Korea and Pakistan have them too, 
which means the next war to destroy these weapons will be fought in 
these countries," Senator Farhatullah Babar of the opposition Pakistan 
People's Party said. "I fear Pakistan might be targeted because its 
(nuclear) command and control system is not responsible," Babar said 
in an upper house debate. Rashid and Kasuri said Pakistan would not 
be deterred by any international pressure to roll back its nuclear 
program. "While continue to play our role in the international camapign 
against terrorism, we cannot be oblivious to our national security 
requirement keeping in view the inimical designs of a hostile neighbour," 
Rashid told AFP. The New York Times reported last year that a Pakistani 
aircraft arrived in Pyongyang as recently as July to pick up North 
Korean missile parts -- the payoff in what it said was a "deadly barter," 
raising questions about US-Pakistan relations. US Secretary of State 
Colin Powell later said he was assured by Pakistan President Pervez 
Musharraf that "there are no further contacts" between Islamabad and 
Pyongyang. But Powell and White House officials have left unanswered 
questions over alleged links in the past. bc-mmg-rj/rcw Pakistan-US-NKorea

Governor Gul Agha of southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province has 
ordered all Taliban to leave the war-torn country's south within 10 
days or face "severe punishment." "In the coming 10 days all Taliban 
who are here in Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul and Oruzgan (provinces) must 
leave, except those who get a guarantee from someone that he is not 
going to harm the government or security," he said late Monday. Agah 
was speaking on his return from Shah Wali Kot, north of Kandahar city, 
where pro-government troops backed by US forces have been fighting 
suspected Taliban. "I promise the people of Kandahar that none of 
the Taliban can create problems for stability in the future. "I have 
ordered my commanders not to allow any Talibs in the villages; if 
they are caught they are to be punished severely." He said all Taliban 
working in the government or army must leave their posts or face punishment. 
"I will fill the prisons with them," he said. The governor did not 
say where the former Taliban should go, nor whether other provinces 
would be willing to admit them. Agha described as "baseless" Taliban 
commander Mullah Dadullah Akhund's claims in a BBC interview to have 
killed two Afghan soldiers, and arrested 65 other Afghan and US troops. 
"This claim is baseless. He did kill one (person), but that was an 
innocent ICRC worker and he did not arrest 65 people," he said. Salvadoran-born 
International Committee of the Red Cross worker Ricardo Munuia was 
last Thursday killed by unknown attackers in neighbouring Oruzgan 
province. Agha launched his military operations following the murder. 
Kandahar commander Khan Mohammad, who returned from battle with the 
governor, questioned where the estimated hundreds of thousands of 
former Taliban lingering in the four southern provinces would go. 
"Due to his anger he made this speech," Mohammad said, before holding 
talks with the governor. Mohammad said 13 Taliban arrested during 
the operation around Shah Wali Kot included former Taliban trade and 
commerce minister Mullah Abdul Rajaq. The eight killed included Taliban 
commander Mullah Gul Mohammad. Among those believed to have escaped 
was Mullah Zahir, described by Mohammad as a close friend of the Taliban's 
spiritual leader Mullah Omar, who has so far eluded capture despite 
an international manhunt. Three more Taliban were arrested near where 
the Red Cross worker was killed and Kandahar police arrested another 
27 over the past two days, he said. Kandahar was the heartland of 
the Taliban regime until the hardline Islamist militia was ousted 
by a US-led coalition after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Taliban 
and al-Qaeda remnants continue to launch attacks against US and government 
forces. str-mtp/bc/rcw Afghanistan-fighting

The unsuspecting could have been tricked into thinking the US-led 
war in Iraq had taken a sudden surreal twist on Tuesday, as newspapers 
around the world spun bitter-sweet April Fool's reports about the 
conflict. In South Africa the Afrikaans Beeld newspaper told its readers 
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had accepted an offer of exile 
in the country in exchange for a top job running the country's oil 
industry, As part of the deal, Saddam would be offered a luxury game 
farm near the smoggy oil city of Sasolburg, the daily wrote. Washington 
was said to be excited about the offer, which would make the Iraqi 
leader "somebody else's problem", the paper fibbed. "Oscar withdrawn 
in punishment," headlined Greece's Eleftheros Typos daily, reporting 
from Hollywood that the film academy had called back an award given 
to Michael Moore, the anti-war US director of the subversive documentary 
"Bowling for Columbine". Moore had lashed out at the US administration 
during the award ceremony on March 23. "We are against this war Mr 
Bush. Shame on you. Shame on you!," he said, bringing both cheers 
and boos from the glitterati audience. Germany's Tageszeitung ran 
a spoof report saying that tensions over Iraq had led Washington to 
rethink the site for its new embassy in Berlin. The current site is 
on Berlin's Pariser Platz -- which means Parisian square -- and directly 
opposite the French mission. France spearheaded fierce diplomatic 
resistance to US plans for war against Iraq, dashing hopes by London, 
Washington and Madrid of obtaining a second UN resolution authorising 
military action. Tageszeitung, quoting American sources, said US diplomats 
"could live with being next to the French, but only if the name of 
the square is changed". Another spoof, from the Belgian paper Le Soir, 
reported that like Saddam, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel had 
several near-perfect lookalikes who cover for him during television 
appearances. Michel, a strong opponent of the war against Iraq, has 
become a something of a regular on Belgian television debates, leading 
some to joke that he seemed to be everywhere at once. In Japan, the 
Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported that the world's largest oilfields 
had been discovered in Tokyo Bay, a revelation set to tip the balance 
of power with Washington radically in Japan's favour. The paper separately 
reported that Japan planned to send robots modelled on the popular 
1960s cartoon character Astro Boy to help with post-war reconstruction 
in Iraq. "It is partly aimed at showing the world the right way to 
use science technology following the loss of confidence in US high-tech 
weapons," the paper wrote. Kenya's East African Standard reported 
that US-led forces in Iraq were looking for reinforcements in Kenya, 
Ethiopia and Sudan, better adapted to the desert and semi-arid conditions, 
which were giving the coalition forces "a rough time", the report 
said. Other press April Fools jokes played safer by staying away from 
the war in Iraq. The Sydney Morning Herald's Good Living supplement 
featured a spoof review of a restaurant called Species, where it said 
diners could feast on a menu created from animals from the World Wildlife 
Fund's endangered list. The restaurant, owned by on April Phewell, 
was said to specialise in braised slices of hairy nosed wombat, yellow 
spotted tree frog kebabs and Sumatran Rhino steaks. In Sydney's Daily 
Telegraph and Melbourne's Herald Sun, an advertisement claimed motorists 
would be able to save on road tolls using new technology that made 
their cars invisible. The European Commission meanwhile announced 
a ban on single-shelled eggs -- a play on the French word "coque" 
which means both egg shell and ship's hull. The Greek EU presidency 
joined in the fun, announcing plans to scrap the EU's Stability and 
Growth Pact on its website. Some papers ducked out of the April 1 
tradition, however, branding it indecent at such a time of crisis. 
"Eleftherotypia will not follow the tradition. It will not offer you 
an April Fool's lie," the anti-war Greek newspaper printed on page 
one. "Others have served you one already -- with bombs and with death," 
it wrote in an allusion to the US-led war. burs/ec/ds Iraq-war-AprilFool

Ukraine on Tuesday denied US media reports that accused Ukrainian 
arms dealers of selling up to 1,000 anti-tank missiles to Iraq. "This 
is unfounded information based on unverified facts," foreign ministry 
spokesman Markian Lubkivsky said, quoted by Interfax news agency. 
Newsweek reported in its issue published Monday that Iraq secretly 
bought the powerful Russian-made Kornet missiles from Ukrainian arms 
dealers. The missiles may have reached Iraq through Syria, the report 
said, quoting unnamed sources in the US defense department. The anti-tank 
missiles were used to attack two US tanks which were the first to 
be destroyed by enemy fire in the current Iraq war, according to Newsweek. 
"Ukraine strictly respects the UN Security Council sanctions against 
Iaq and has never delivered any arms to that country," Lubkivsky said. 
"We consider this affair a new attempt to harm the authority of our 
country," he added. Iraq is banned from acquiring military equipment 
under UN sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Ukraine 
has repeatedly denied US accusations that it sold a sophisticated 
radar system to Iraq with the personal approval of President Leonid 
Kuchma. Those accusations, first launched in September, prompted the 
United States to drastically cut its aid to the former Soviet country 
-- once the third largest recipient of US aid after Israel and Egypt. 
Ukraine has recently attempted to improve its relationship with the 
United States, deploying a chemical decontamination unit to Kuwait 
last week to help in the event of a chemical weapons attack by Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein. sb/me/ns Iraq-war-US-Ukraine

The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the reopening of a 
murder case against a top senator and presidential hopeful. Voting 
10-4 with one abstention, it ordered a regional trial court to "proceed 
with dispatch on the case" against Panfilo Lacson, a tough-talking 
former national police chief who is tipped as a leading opposition 
candidate for next year's presidential race. Lacson, who was chief 
of an elite presidential anti-crime unit under former president Joseph 
Estrada, and several other police officers had been charged previously 
before a special anti-graft court for the May 1995 murder of 11 alleged 
members of a notorious robbery gang called Kuratong Baleleng. The 
Supreme Court subsequently transferred the case to the suburban Quezon 
city regional court north of Manila, which then dismissed the case 
in 1999 because several witnesses recanted their statements. A new 
investigation was launched by the justice deparment in 2001 after 
new witnesses came forward, and it asked the Supreme Court to have 
the case revived. Lacson in a statement said Tuesday's ruling was 
"most lamentable." He argued that the case should not be revived because 
a "two-year prescriptive period" in which court rulings could be appealed 
against has lapsed. "The decision of the high tribunal bodes ill for 
the rule of law in this country, considering that the same Supreme 
Court defined the rules of prescription," Lacson said. "I have already 
conferred with my lawyers and they will file a motion for reconsideration 
but as things stand now, there's a very slim chance that our motion 
will be granted." "The Supreme Court is the final arbiter when it 
come to matters of law," President Gloria Arroyo's spokesman Ignacio 
Bunye said, reacting to the ruling. "It is an independent body. Its 
decision carries the weight of the law and must be respected." Court 
officials said Lacson has 15 days to appeal the Tuesday ruling. Lacson 
had earlier announced plans to contest the presidency in May next 
year and is believed to be among the politicians short-listed to be 
the opposition's standard bearer. str/jvg/pp/rcw Philippines-crime-politics

Thousands of Bangladeshis want to fight against US in Iraq by Nadeem 
Qadir = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - ADDS anti-war demos, foreign ministry 
comment /// DHAKA, April 1 (AFP) - Thousands of Bangladeshis are ready 
to join forces with the Iraqis to fight the US-led invasion, saying 
they want to join a jihad, or holy war, veterans said Tuesday. "We 
have at least 5,000 members and they are mostly eager to go to Iraq 
and fight the Anglo-American forces who are waging an unjust war," 
Ziaul Kabir Dulu, chairman of the PRMS -- Palestine Repatriated Muktijoddah 
Sangshad (Freedom Fighters Council), told AFP. Members of PRMS have 
fought alongside Palestinians against Israel. "We seek Allah's blessings 
and we need fighters to save the sovereignty and territorial integrity 
of Iraq with the spirit of jihad," Dulu said. He said he did not know 
if he would go to the Gulf, as he was in his 50s, but as well as members 
of his council there were many young Bangladeshis who have told him 
they want to join the war to save Iraq from "aggression." Mohammad 
Shahidullah, PRMS's general secretary, added they took the decision 
to join the war at a meeting in Dhaka on Monday. "Our members are 
spread across Bangladesh, but we are maintaining contact with them," 
he said. Asked how they planned to go to Iraq, Dulu said: "We joined 
the Palestine war by flying through different capitals before reaching 
Lebanon and we will try to do the same (this time)." Dulu said the 
Bangladeshis would be fighting for the Iraqi people, not President 
Saddam Hussein. "That is not the issue now, the issue is Iraqi people 
and their territorial integrity. "We fought indirectly against the 
US when we fought with the Palestinians and also during our independence 
war in 1971, as the US had backed Pakistan." Bangladesh, formerly 
East Pakistan, broke away to emerge as an independent country in 1971 
after a nine-month war. Washington sided with the Pakistani military 
regime as it pursued "ping-pong diplomacy" to restore ties with China 
with Islamabad's help. Duli said they wanted government backing as 
both Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and main opposition leader Sheikh 
Hasina Wajed have called for an end to the Iraq war. "Nobody has approached 
us on this matter," Foreign Secretary Shamser Mobin Chowdhury told 
reporters. Anti-war demonstrations have taken place almost daily in 
Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, and 
Dhaka has repeatedly called for a peaceful end to the crisis. On Monday 
some 200 men took to the streets demanding the government help them 
join the war to save Iraq, the Bhorer Kagoj daily reported. Several 
demonstrations, including one by the farmers wing of the ruling Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party, were staged Tuesday in the capital Dhaka with protestors 
burning effigies of US President George W. Bush and British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair. Police kept a close watch and the several hundred 
demonstrators dispersed peacefully, witnesses said. nq/gt/an/th Iraq-war-Bangladesh

French consumers have turned deeply pessimistic and prefer to save 
rather than continue the spending which held up the economy last year, 
data showed on Tuesday, adding to government worries over weak growth. 
The consumer figures came amid a raft of new data on Tuesday, adding 
to concern over the government's ability to stick to the budget and 
planned tax cuts after being forced to almost halve its original 2003 
growth forecast. Data released by official statistics office INSEE 
on Tuesday showed that French consumers were increasingly gloomy on 
all fronts, and were beginning to save rather than spend. The main 
household confidence indicator fell to minus-32 in March, from minus-26 
in February, based on data collected from March 1 to March 19, just 
before the outbreak of the war in Iraq. Pessimism about the outlook 
for unemployment was at a "historic high-point", the statistics institute 
said that, but households were slightly more confident than previously 
about their ability to save. The news came as separate car industry 
figures appeared to confirm that the French consumer was indeed putting 
his foot on the brake. New car sales, seen as a leading indicator 
of economic activity, fell 5.6 percent in March, French car makers' 
association CCFA said on Tuesday. "After having fully supported growth, 
French households are giving in," said Marc Touati, an analyst with 
Natexis Banques Populaires. The INSEE data showing consumers' increasing 
inclination to save bore out remarks by Finance Minister Francis Mer 
last month, who voiced concern over signs that tax cuts implemented 
this year were ending up in savings accounts rather than shops. Data 
from the manufacturing sector on Tuesday added to the gloom, with 
the main purchasing managers' confidence index falling to 48.1 points 
in March from 51.5 points in February. The CDAF association of buyers 
and supply directors said its falling index reflected "the strongest 
deterioration of global order books in 14 months". INSEE also said 
on Tuesday that its index of wholesalers' confidence had fallen to 
a ten-year low point, with equipment sales -- traditionally seen as 
an early indicator of investment trends -- leading the swing to pessimism. 
Underlining the precariousness of France's current economic situation, 
Anne Beaudu of Credit Agricole said the last time INSEE's employment 
confidence sub-indicator was as low as its present level -- 84 -- 
was 10 years ago. "At that time, unemployment rose from 11.6 perent 
to 12.3 percent in eight months," she said. The government has shown 
increasing concern in the last week that prospects for growth this 
year, already reduced sharply at the beginning of March, are fading 
further. The most recent revision in mid-March saw the government's 
2003 growth forecast reduced to 1.3 percent -- just over half the 
2.5 percent prediction underpinning its 2003 budget. There is also 
alarm over the high level of both the public deficit and government 
debt run up in recent years, which seriously limit the government's 
room for manoeuvre -- for example by increasing spending to boost 
growth -- as it approaches a possible economic crisis. The European 
Union issued an early warning over the deficit in January, and Prime 
Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has admitted it is likely to exceed 
the euro-zone limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) 
this year. Total debt, meanwhile is edging towards 60 percent of GDP, 
the maximum level tolerated under euro-zone rules. od/lmf/hd France-economy-confidence

Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will go ahead with an official 
visit to India next week despite a pneumonia outbreak here, the Singapore 
foreign ministry said Tuesday. The Hindustan Times of India earlier 
reported that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) problem 
in Singapore and other East Asian countries could result in a postponement 
of the visit starting April 7. "The prime minister has confirmed that 
he will be visiting India next week," a spokesman for the Singapore 
ministry of foreign affairs said in reply to media queries. "The Indian 
government has been alerted of the SARS problem in Singapore but would 
like the visit to proceed as scheduled," the spokesman added. The 
mystery illness first erupted in southern China in November but has 
now spread to 22 countries after being transported by air travellers, 
although it is largely concentrated in East Asian countries. In Singapore, 
four people have died out of more than 90 cases reported. SARS has 
now left at least 63 people dead and infected over 1,900 people worldwide, 
reaching as far as Europe and North America. It is transmitted by 
close human contact althrough there are fears it could be airborne 
as well. The Hindustan Times had reported that as a precautionary 
measure, the Singapore government had asked New Delhi to consider 
a postponement of Goh's visit. It quoted an unidentified Singaporean 
official as saying that Singapore did not want the Indian hosts to 
be afraid of contracting the disease from their visitors. India alerted 
all its international airports Tuesday to screen passengers for SARS 
and quarantine those showing symptoms, airport officials said in the 
financial capital Bombay. rc/bh/rcw Health-pneumonia-Singapore-India

While Islam universally bans suicide as a crime against oneself, it 
allows it in defence of Muslims and their land, and celebrates as 
"martyrs" those who make the sacrifice. The Arabic term for kamikaze-style 
acts is not "suicide attacks" but "martyr operations," underscoring 
that they fall under the Muslims' sacred duty to wage jihad, or holy 
war, when they come under attack. A martyr, or "shaheed" in Arabic, 
describes both those who die while fighting and civilians killed by 
the enemy. There is a consensus that "martyr operations" can be resorted 
to when the defenders have no other options or when the invader has 
an overwhelming force -- such as the US-led coalition invading Iraq, 
the Israeli army against the Palestinians, or Russian troops against 
the Chechens. In 1983, suicide bombings of US and French army positions 
in Beirut killed hundreds and forced the two nations to withdraw from 
Lebanon. Muslim scholars, from both the Sunni and Shiite branches, 
reject martyr operations when their forces have the advantage. They 
also stress that self-sacrifice should be motivated by the fight, 
not to escape personal problems. However, eve a leading moderate Islamic 
scholar, Syria's Grand Mufti Sheikh Ahmad Kaftaro, has called for 
"martyr operations" against the US and British invaders in Iraq. Kaftaro 
rose to fame in May 2001, when he walked with Pope John Paul II into 
Damascus's historic Omeyyads Mosque, marking the first visit by a 
head of the Catholic Church to a Muslim place of worship. "I call 
on Muslims everywhere to use all means possible to thwart the aggression, 
including martyr operations against the belligerent American, British 
and Zionist invaders," Kaftaro said last Thursday. "Resistance to 
the belligerent invaders is an obligation for all Muslims, starting 
with (those in) Iraq," the mufti said. Two days later, an Iraqi officer 
driving a taxi carried out a suicide bombing at a US checkpoint near 
the Shiite Muslim holy city of Najaf, some 150 kilometers (90 miles) 
south of Baghdad. Besides himself, the US-led coalition says he killed 
four US troops, while Baghdad says he killed 11. Iraq warned the coalition 
Saturday that more than 4,000 volunteers had come from every Arab 
nation "without exception", ready to follow in the footsteps of the 
Iraqi officer who carried out the suicide attack, Ali Jaafar Musa 
Hammadi al-Numani, whom President Saddam Hussein awarded two top posthumous 
medals of honor. The Palestinian radical movement Islamic Jihad also 
said Sunday it had sent a first batch of its suicide bombers to Baghdad. 
And the militant movement Ansar al-Islam, which Washington links to 
Al-Qaeda and has attacked repeatedly in Iraqi Kurdistan during the 
war, has redeployed and is preparing suicide attacks against coalition 
forces, a statement on an Islamist website said Monday. Saturday's 
attack near Najaf prompted the US forces to curtail the movements 
of Iraqi civilians and impose stricter security measure that could 
harm their proclaimed effort to win over the "hearts and minds" of 
Iraqi civilians. But showing that the incident has made troops nervous, 
US officials admitted that seven Iraqi women and children had been 
accidentally shot dead at a checkpoint near Najaf on Monday afternoon. 
Still, General Vincent Brooks at the US Central Command's forward 
base in Qatar discounted suicide attacks as "a terror tactic" that 
"won't be effective" in checking coalition plans to remove Saddam.

Listeners to Swaziland's state radio heard "live" reports from war 
correspondent Phesheya Dube, purportedly from Iraq, but then saw him 
walking around Mbabane. Radio presenter Moses Mthetho Matsebula asked 
listeners to pray for Dube, the acting head of programmes for the 
Swaziland Broadcasting and Information Services. "Fellow countrymen, 
it looks like our correspondent in a Baghdad cave has been bombed 
and I have been trying to locate him to no avail and I am asking for 
your prayers so that you cannot lose such a good reporter," Matsebula 
said. On Thursday last week -- a week after the Iraq war started -- 
Dube went to parliament, where curious MPs asked him when he had returned 
from the Iraqi capital. He reportedly admitted that he had been monitoring 
television reports on the Iraq war, then interpreting them for Swazis 
without TV sets. MP Jojo Dlamini, from Mayiwane, in northern Swaziland, 
asked Information Minister Mntonzima Dlamini in parliament: "Mr Minister, 
can you explain to this house why the Swaziland Broadcasting and Information 
Services is allowed to mislead the public that Phesheya was reporting 
live from Baghdad when he was reporting from his house?" Dlamini promised 
to respond on Thursday. str/hn/pbl/kdz Iraq-war-Swaziland-media

The German government has asked the central bank, the Bundesbank, 
to calculate the value of Iraqi assets being held in Germany, the 
economics and labour ministry said Tuesday. A spokesman said the figures 
were expected to be ready "in coming days". Iraqi bank accounts in 
Germany have been closed under UN Security Council Resolution 661, 
which was passed in August 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. It requires 
all Iraqi funds to be frozen and forbids UN member countries from 
making money available to the regime. The ministry noted that under 
German law, Baghdad's assets here could not be seized, as is the case 
in the United States. The United States has confiscated more than 
1.7 billion dollars (1.56 billion euros) in Iraqi assets held in US 
bank accounts and has called for the world to freeze any funds to 
use in rebuilding Iraq. Britain has also made similar moves. loc/km/hd

Attack fighters from this US Navy aircraft carrier in the Gulf bombed 
a yacht belonging to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the southern 
port of Basra Monday, a navy spokeswoman said Tuesday. It was the 
second such attack reported in a week. Aircraft also bombed an Iraqi 
naval vessel, the Ibn Khaldoon, Lieutenant Junior Grade Nicole Kratzer 
told reporters. She said both vessels were in Basra but could provide 
no other details. Damage was still being assessed, she said. Iraq 
described the naval craft as a frigate, but according to Captain Michael 
Mahon, who is responsible for surface warfare within this carrier's 
battle group, Iraq had only one missile patrol boat and a handful 
of patrol craft at the start of the war. On Friday the captain of 
the British frigate HMS Chatham, Michael Cochrane, said warplanes 
of the US and British coalition sank Saddam's yacht Al Mansur in Basra 
the previous Tuesday. "There are reliable reports indicating that 
in a blow to Saddam's presidential pride, the huge presidential yacht 
is among the ships sunk," Cochrane told reporters. British officers 
said that attack also wiped out most of what remained of the Iraqi 
navy, two large patrol boats and a supply ship. Cochrane said one 
other Iraqi patrol boat was already sunk and six others captured.

Lenders to the 2.9 billion-dollar power plant built by collapsed US 
giant Enron in the western Indian state of Maharashtra started a meeting 
Tuesday to work out a proposal to revive the project, officials said. 
The two-day meeting is due to discuss a plan to start the 2,184-megawatt 
power facility, Dabhol Power, which has been shut for more than 20 
months after a payment dispute with its sole customer, the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board. The meeting is between the Indian and overseas 
lenders to the project such as Industrial Bank of India, ABN Amro, 
Citibank, ICICI and others. "Our top officials involved with the project 
are in Singapore for two days starting Tuesday to discuss as to how 
the project can be revived," a senior official with one of the key 
lenders said. "The plan is to revive the project as soon as possible. 
Initial discussions will also focus on raising the immediate requirement 
for working capital to start the project." The bankrupt US energy 
giant Enron holds a 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power, while Bechtel 
and General Electric Co. each hold 10 percent. MSEB holds the remaining 
15 percent. Last year's bankruptcy of Enron compounded the problems 
for the project, with Indian financial institutions who have lent 
60 billion rupees (1.25 billion dollars) to help build the plant, 
going to court to try recover their dues. Earlier this year US Ambassador 
to India Robert Blackwill urged Indian authorities to reopen the project 
that has the country's single largest foreign investment. He said 
a speedy solution would revive the inflow of stagnating US investment 
in India. India's leading industrial group, the Tata group, and British 
energy major BP, are jointly planning to revive the project and have 
signed a memorandum of understanding with each other to assess the 
business prospects. jds/bm/dv India-Singapore-electricity-Enron-company

A state prosecutor requested a life sentence Tuesday against the man 
who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader Pim Fortuyn, describing 
the assassination as an attack on the democratic process. "This was 
a murder of freedom of speech," said prosecutor Koos Plooy in his 
closing argument on the third day of the trial. "This assassination 
is without precedent and must never happen again," Plooy said. The 
murder happened just days before a general election last year in which 
Fortuyn's party was to score impressive gains. "Whoever hits the heart 
of the democratic process must be severely punished," the prosecutor 
told the court. Fortuyn supporters in the public gallery cheered when 
Plooy announced he would seek life imprisonment. Fortuyn's brother 
Marten, also present in court gave the prosecutor the thumbs up sign. 
Van der Graaf, a 33-year-old animal rights supporter and vegetarian, 
confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. The assassination 
of the populist, anti-immigrant politician last May stunned the country, 
which had seen no other political murder in its recent history. In 
his confession Van der Graaf said that he shot Fortuyn because he 
was "a danger to the weaker groups in society"; namely Muslims, asylum 
seekers, immigrants and animals. Van der Graaf, has been charged with 
premeditated murder, threatening Fortuyn's driver with a weapon, illegal 
possession of arms and ammunition. The prosecution said Tuesday that 
it would drop a fourth charge of possession of explosive chemicals 
because Plooy felt he had not presented enough evidence to support 
the charge. A psychiatric report ordered by the court and presented 
on Monday concluded that the suspect had some mental problems but 
was fit to stand trial and could be held responsible for his actions. 
Fortuyn was shot five times at close range as he left a radio studio 
in the central town of Hilversum on May 6, 2002, just 10 days before 
the Dutch general elections. He had rattled the Dutch establishment 
with his open homosexuality and fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric. But 
he also won broad favour with many voters who felt there was finally 
someone who spoke frankly and addressed their concerns. In his closing 
argument the prosecutor cast Van der Graaf as a cold-blooded killer 
who liquidated Fortuyn because he did not approve of his political 
ideas. Plooy reminded the court that Van der Graaf had only expressed 
regret over the killing in so far as it affected his girlfriend and 
daughter. "With the rise of a new political figure in whom he sees 
another danger to society I estimate that the chances that (Van der 
Graaf) will re-offend are quite high," said the prosecutor. After 
Fortuyn was killed, his LPF party went on to score well in the election 
and to take part in a coalition government. However that administration 
collapsed in September last year, and Fortuyn's party crashed in the 
ensuing elections, held in January. But despite the LPF's fall from 
grace, Fortuyn's outspoken views and anti-immigrant stance, vigorously 
attacked before by mainstream politicians, are now openly debated 
in parliament. The hearings in Amsterdam's high security courtroom 
known as "the bunker" will continue Tuesday with the closing arguments 
of the defence. The judges are expected to deliver their verdict in 
two weeks. gdh-sb/ds Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial

Asian stock markets were trapped in a tight range Tuesday due to on-going 
investor concerns about a deadly pneumonia virus and the Iraq war. 
Japanese share prices closed slightly higher on fresh demand associated 
with the new fiscal year, but with the upside capped by uncertainty 
over the duration of the war. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei 225 
index ended the first day of the new Japanese financial year up 0.18 
percent or 14.01 points at 7,986.72 and the Topix index of all first 
section issues closed up 0.96 points at 788.96. "Yesterday, the local 
stockmarket was pressured by selling related to the end-March fiscal 
year account closure. But such selling eased today, the first day 
of the new fiscal year," said Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Hinode 
Securities. But Karikomi said the market failed to extend its gains 
because fears the US-led war in Iraq would be prolonged were still 
overhanging the market. "If overseas stockmarkets continue to fall 
due to the uncertainty of the duration of the war in Iraq, the local 
stockmarket will also continue to be pressured," he said. Dealers 
said the release of the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing a marginal 
deterioration in business confidence in the three months to March 
had little impact on the market as it was within expectations. "There 
was no surprise in the Tankan survey. Rather, investors were reacting 
to growing uncertainty over the war," said Hiroichi Nishi, senior 
market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities. HONG KONG: Share prices 
in Hong Kong closed 0.44 percent lower due to continued fears about 
the rapid spread of a killer virus. The key Hang Seng index lost 37.56 
points to close at 8,596.89. Dealers said the downside narrowed at 
the market close after the government rejected rumours it will declare 
Hong Kong an infected area. "Market sentiment was very weak because 
of the fears over SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)... there 
were also rumours that the government may declare Hong Kong an infected 
area," said Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities. 
SYDNEY: The Australian sharemarket was largely unmoved by falls in 
global markets, with brokers saying strength in the banking sector 
offset ongoing concerns about the war in Iraq. The SP/ASX 200 index 
closed down 3.0 points or 0.10 percent at 2,882.2, while the All Ordinaries 
index was down 4.4 points at 2,844.2. Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie 
Spiteri said the defensive nature of the Australian share market was 
helping steady sentiment, enabling the index to shrug off falls in 
New York and London. "In these uncertain times the money tends to 
be directed towards the more conservative area of the market," Spiteri 
said. SINGAPORE: Share prices in Singapore closed 1.16 percent higher 
after recent sharp falls as investors looked to amass bargain stocks, 
but worries of the protracted war in Iraq remained. The Straits Times 
Index gained 14.76 points to 1,282.58, off its intraday high of 1,292.24 
as profit-taking set in, and All-Singapore Equities index rose 3.51 
points to 344.37. "Overall, the market is looking good. Although volume 
has not been high, movements have been rather slow," a dealer at a 
local brokerage said. "It is probably a 'slow and steady' uptrend, 
rather than one of those strong spikes," the dealer said. SEOUL: South 
Korean share prices rose 0.53 percent as retail bargain-hunting offset 
early weakness triggered by losses on Wall Street amid concerns over 
the Iraq war. The composite index closed up 2.86 points at 538.56. 
"It was just a brief break on the steep downhill slope," Sejong Securities 
market analyst Yoo Ji-Sang said, referring to the rebound from the 
3.71 percent plunge on Monday. Yoo noted that foreign investors continued 
to curtail down their holdings in the local bourse. burs/dv Stocks-Asia-daily

China Tuesday lashed out at Taiwan for blaming the mainland for hastening 
the spread of the global outbreak of a deadly atypical form of pneumonia. 
"The Chinese government is a responsible government. The Chinese government 
has also spent a lot of effort to control the spread of the disease," 
foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "I believe some parties 
want to use the issue to make malicious attacks. I think that is irresponsible 
and unacceptable," Liu said. Liu, who was speaking at a regular briefing, 
was asked to comment on Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian's comment 
Friday alleging that China tried to cover up the extent of the epidemic 
within its borders -- hence hastening the spread of the illness, called 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). "SARS first broke out on 
the Chinese mainland, but they (Chinese authorities) covered up the 
information, leading to a global epidemic that has also affected Taiwan 
severely," Chen said. Asked by a Taiwanese reporter Tuesday to respond 
to "President Chen Shuibian's" statement, Liu jokingly tried to correct 
the reporter's reference to Chen as "president." China does not use 
that title for Chen, as it considers Taiwan a renegade province awaiting 
unification. Taiwan has banned visits by civil servants to SARS-affected 
areas including mainland China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Taiwan's Centre 
for Disease Control puts the number of local "probable cases" at 13, 
most of them reporting the illness following trips to mainland China 
and Hong Kong. The mysterious illness has now infected some 1,900 
people in 22 countries and territories and killed at least 63, including 
34 people in mainland China. cs/th Health-pneumonia-China-Taiwan

Retail sales in Britain suffered the most widespread annual fall for 
more than a decade in March, according to a survey by the Confederation 
of British Industry (CBI) published Tuesday. Of the 227 respondents, 
only 28 percent of firms said sales were up on March last year, while 
41 percent said they were down, the business grouping said. The difference 
between the two gives a balance of minus 13 per cent, the first significant 
fall since January 1999 and the lowest balance since July 1992. The 
outlook remains downbeat with sales expected to remain unchanged in 
the year to April, the weakest expectations for eight years, the survey 
found. "Sales growth has stalled in almost every retail sector," said 
CBI chief economic adviser Ian McCafferty. "These results confirm 
our fears that consumer confidence has been affected by uncertainties 
surrounding the war in Iraq, the impending tax rises and worries about 
the housing market," he added. This month British consumers face increases 
in both national insurance, a direct payroll tax, and council tax, 
which is imposed by local authorities. The survey, conducted between 
March 4 and 19, covers more than 20,000 outlets of firms responsible 
for 40 percent of employment in retailing. dr/pw/hd Britain-economy-retail-confidence

Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon has told manager Alex 
Ferguson he will have to sell some of his highly-paid stars if he 
wants to make any big buys this summer. Kenyon, who announced reduced 
profits of 20.3 million pounds (32 million dollars) for the six months 
to the end of January, said United were unlikely to match the 30 million 
pound (47 million dollar) fee they paid Leeds United for England defender 
Rio Ferdinand last July. Ferguson has spent almost 80 million pounds 
(126 million dollars) on Ferdinand, Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian 
Veron and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy over the past 18 months. 
But Kenyon said Tuesday any more mammoth buys were out of the question. 
"Certainly from Manchester United's perspective we believe these kind 
of sums to buy players are a thing of the past," he said. "It is fair 
to say that if Sir Alex wants to buy someone, he will have to sell 
someone else," said Kenyon. "The reality is that you can only field 
11 players at one time and we currently have 24 in our squad, which, 
when it is supplemented with some of our younger players, we feel 
is the right number to get through 70-plus games a year. "What we 
have consistently said is that we will not bring in players just to 
sit on the bench." Ferguson recently complained that United were lagging 
behind the likes of European rivals Real Madrid and Milan in terms 
of squad numbers, but he was unable to bring in any reinforcements 
during the January transfer window. And last month Ferguson hinted 
he was prepared to off-load players like Ryan Giggs to help finance 
another splurge in the transfer market. Kenyon said he did not regret 
the Ferdinand transfer. "Hindsight is a wonderful thing but we are 
now seeing transfer prices come down. Buying Rio was the right decision 
at the time and it remains so," he said. "He fitted into the right 
age profile and we look upon him as a long term investment. "We made 
the decision to buy him in light of our overall wage structure and 
transfer budget we set ourselves and we achieved those targets," he 
added. bur/rw/ak Fbl-ENG-Pr-ManUtd-transfers

England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson on Tuesday shrugged off reports 
that a Turkish spy had smuggled a video camera into the squad's training 
camp ahead of Wednesday's Euro 2004 qualifier. The reports were splashed 
across most English newspapers on Tuesday -- although accounts varied 
as to whether the alleged spy had been disguised as a golfer or a 
charity worker who was part of a party which met the England squad. 
Either way, Eriksson was not perturbed by the prospect of his Turkish 
counterpart, Senol Gunes, getting the inside track on his tactical 
preparations. "It does not matter at all," the Swede smiled. "I don't 
think they they could have learned that much by filming us yesterday 
as neither David Beckham or Kieron Dyer took part in the session." 
Even if England had been at full strength, Eriksson suggested Turkey 
would not have been surprised by anything they saw on the video tape. 
"When you meet a team at this level you always know how they will 
play," he said. "They'll know how we'll play and we'll know how they 
will play." am/rw03 Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Spy

Several countries reported their first suspected cases of a deadly 
respiratory virus at the centre of a global health crisis Tuesday 
as Hong Kong announced plans to send victims of the disease to quarantine 
camps. Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and Sweden said they were all 
treating patients suspected to be suffering from atypical pneumonia, 
also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The virus 
claimed another death on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong man 
succumbing to the disease. SARS has now killed 34 people in China, 
16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore 
and one in Thailand. In Hong Kong, deputy director of health P.Y. 
Leung said hundreds of people confined for 10 days Monday under emergency 
quarantine measures to a 33-storey residential complex on Hong Kong's 
Kowloon peninsula would now be transferred to two government-run holiday 
camps. "As cases of atypical pneumonia continue to rise ... we have 
arranged for the residents to be transferred temporarily to two holiday 
camps to reside there until the end of their isolation period," he 
said. Hong Kong and Singapore have also closed all primary and secondary 
schools in a bid to stem the outbreak. Singapore has put more than 
800 households under mandatory home quarantine for 10 days and placed 
600,000 school children on vacation until April 6. Thailand and India 
meanwhile joined a list of countries who have stepped up measures 
to combat the spread of the diseases, confirming plans to screen passengers 
arriving from infected areas. Thai health authorities took the step 
of declaring the virus as a serious communicable disease, an emergency 
move authorising the quarantine of suspected carriers for 14 days. 
In Australia, health officials said a man recently returned from Singapore 
had become the country's first likely SARS case but had made a full 
recovery after being admitted to a Sydney hospital. "We still cannot 
be sure this person had SARS, but in the absence of other diagnosis, 
we thought it would be prudent to alert the WHO (World Health Organization) 
to this unusual case," said chief medical officer Richard Smallwood. 
In Malaysia, health ministry director general Mohamad Taha Arif was 
quoted as saying that eight people with suspected symptoms of Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) had been admitted to hospital for 
tests. A 37-year-old woman was in hospital in southern Johor state 
neighbouring Singapore while the other seven cases were reported in 
and around the capital Kuala Lumpur, he said. Indonesia also reported 
its first suspected cases, with two women feared to have been infected 
by the disease, Health Minister Achmad Suyudi said. On the medical 
front, livestock in southern China were cited Tuesday as a possible 
cause of the virus as frustration grew with Beijing for its handling 
of the crisis. The outbreak began in southern China in November, spread 
to Hong Kong in February and from there to three continents through 
airline passengers. The Wall Street Journal meanwhile called for the 
world to sever all travel links to China for the "grossly negligent" 
way it has handled the outbreak. But China responded by insisting 
it had acted correctly and now had the outbreak under control. "The 
Chinese government has all along adopted a very responsible attitude 
on this issue," foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said. "We 
know the situation we're in is a safe one." The WHO has been more 
restrained in dealing with the Chinese authorities but a WHO expert 
currently in Beijing awaiting permission to travel to Guangdong province, 
the epicenter of the outbreak, betrayed some annoyance on Tuesday. 
"China needs to get up to speed with the international effort to map 
the spread of this disease," said Dr. James Maguire. "During a global 
epidemic all players need to participate, if a major player chooses 
not to, this could be very problematic," he told AFP. A source close 
to the WHO said Tuesday that the Geneva-based health body was "working 
on a theory that the virus has its source in farm animals in southern 
China." Peter Cordingley, the spokesman for the Manila-based Western 
Pacific WHO regional office, said: "At this stage, we are not saying 
this is the cause but it is certainly something we are looking into 
in the general scheme of things." Hitoshi Oshitani, a Manila-based 
WHO expert on communicable disease, said viruses of many emerging 
diseases were known to have come from animals by "crossing species 
barriers." bur/cl/rcw/th Health-pneumonia

More than 14,000 Liberians have since late last week crossed the border 
into Guinea, fleeing fighting between government troops and rebels 
in their own country, according to UN relief workers. Guinea's interior 
ministry on Tuesday issued a statement saying the country was prepared 
to take in the refugees and authorize the extension of a camp to shelter 
them. Staff of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) late 
Monday said people had kept on coming throughout the day, but an unknown 
number had drowned trying to cross the river along the border. Housseni 
Thiam, president of the Conakry government's National Coordination 
Bureau for Refugees, said the interior ministry has ordered the army 
"to take in all Liberians and foreigners wishing to enter Guinean 
territory". Last week, more than 30,000 people were trapped inside 
Liberia along some 50 kilometres (30 miles) of border territory, between 
the towns of Ganta and Sanniquellie, UNHCR staff said. As fighting 
increased in this region between President Charles Taylor's troops 
and rebels of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), 
some of the refugees reportedly forced their way through border posts. 
Refugees told aid workers that they were on the move because of clashes 
in the Ganta area. Last week, the Liberian government said it had 
seized the country's second city, Gbarnga, east of Ganta, back from 
the rebels. This claim could not be confirmed independently. Inside 
Guinea, about 3,000 refugees have already been transported to the 
Yomou camp in the southeast, while 10,000 others remain spread out 
along the border, Thiam said. The LURD has for three years been trying 
to oust Taylor, a former rebel chief who came to power in a 1997 election 
after a seven-year civil war. Relief workers on Monday began a census 
of the refugees, with plans to get them to camps already established 
in southern Guinea, which has seen an influx of refugees from both 
Liberia and Sierra Leone in the past 12 years. While a civil war which 
devastated Sierra Leone for a decade from 1991 is over, Guinea is 
still home to about 100,000 refugees from several countries, primarily 
Liberia and Ivory Coast. The LURD on Saturday said in a statement 
that it was in control of 14 key towns including Gbarnga. But claiming 
control of the town, the information ministry in Monrovia warned civilians 
to be careful of one rebel vehicle mounted with "a heavy gun" apparently 
"headed for the town of Ganta". "The LURD forces in that jeep are 
armed and desperate and could begin killing innocent citizens at random," 
it said. bm-at/nb/kdz Guinea-Liberia-rebels-refugees

Thailand will need to reassure skittish European investors it will 
safeguard rights of foreign businesses or risk failure as a regional 
investment hub, the European Union trade boss said Tuesday. EU Trade 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy, concluding a two-day visit here, said European 
investment had flattened in Thailand after restrictive measures by 
the government. "During 2002, foreign investment has continued to 
decrease, with European investment stagnating" because business once 
bound for Association of Southeast Asian Nations members now flows 
into China, Lamy said in a speech to Thai and European business communities. 
Approved EU investment in Thailand has plunged from a high of 2.89 
billion euros in 1998 to 579 million euros in 2001, and just 348 million 
euros in 2002, according to the Thai Board of Investment. "If Thailand 
wants to achieve its goal of becoming a trade and investment hub within 
ASEAN, I would urge the Thai government to consider how to attract 
new FDI (foreign direct investment), and how to reassure its existing 
investors," he said. Government initiatives aimed at restricting foreign 
business activities "undoubtedly had a negative impact on the overall 
foreign investment climate," he added. Debate in Thailand has rumbled 
on over whether the government should repeal 11 laws adopted at the 
time of the 1997-1998 regional financial crisis that were pushed by 
the International Monetary Fund to encourage foreign investment here. 
Investors in the telecommunications sector were particularly worried, 
Lamy added. "EU companies investing in the telecommunications sector 
have expressed strong concerns regarding possible reductions to the 
currently permitted levels of FDI. Furthermore, the liberalisation 
of the telecom market in Thailand is not proceeding at the pace which 
it should." Lamy said he addressed the concerns in talks with Prime 
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire whose family controls Thailand's 
largest telecommunications firm. Today's investors, he said, were 
seeking broader choices in the region with the pending implementation 
of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, under which most countries in the 10-member 
ASEAN grouping, including Thailand, must cut import tariffs to a maximum 
of five percent by 2003. Thailand would benefit from having a multilateral 
framework on investment, as proposed by the EU, which would highlight 
transparency and further induce FDI, he said. mlm/sb/dv Thailand-EU-investment

AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - US troops shot dead seven women 
and children at a checkpoint in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, 
as Baghdad claimed that US warplanes had attacked a group of "human 
shields." The reports came after a night of intense bombardments on 
Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite 
Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground 
attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace 
complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his iron 24-year 
rule, came under fresh daylight bombardment on Tuesday for the second 
consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. Iraqi Information Minister 
Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf said that 18 people were killed and more than 
100 wounded in the strikes targeting Saddam's hold on power since 
late Monday. The palace grounds have been a frequent target in the 
bombing. He added that several people were wounded when a US warplane 
attacked two Iraqi buses carrying international volunteers, some of 
them US citizens, who were in the country as "human shields." Sahhaf 
said the incident took place Monday in the western town of Rutba between 
Baghdad and neighbouring Jordan. US forces meanwhile stepped up military 
operations south of Baghdad ahead of an expected major push on the 
Iraqi capital. The checkpoint shooting occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers 
(95 miles) south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander 
Charles Owens said at operational headquarters in Qatar. The incident, 
together with continual bombing on Baghdad, was thought likely to 
fuel vocal international opposition to the 13-day-old war and undermine 
US efforts to win support from the Iraqi people. Owens said the victims, 
seven women and children, were in a civilian vehicle that failed to 
stop at the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by 
US troops. Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. The Washington 
Post reported that 10 civilians had been killed in the incident and 
quoted US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny Johnson as shouting over 
the radio to his men after the shooting: "You just (expletive) killed 
a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough." In Qatar, 
Owens countered that: "As a last resort, they (US troops) fired into 
the passenger compartment of the vehicle," and said that an investigation 
had been opened. In central Iraq, the commander of the Third Infantry 
Division, Major General Buford Blount, said: "We're very concerned... 
and very sorry that it happened." With US troops on edge after a suicide 
car bomb attack Saturday near Najaf killed four soldiers, Blount stressed 
that the unit that opened fire at the checkpoint on Monday had respected 
their rules of engagement. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments 
on Baghdad saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of 
bombing late Monday. AFP reporters said the raids on Baghdad were 
growing more intense and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be 
the heaviest yet to have hit the battered city's downtown area. A 
plume of smoke rose into the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed 
into the heart of the presidential compound Tuesday. A spokesman for 
the Iraqi regime denied reports from the Pentagon that members of 
Saddam's family were trying to flee the country. "The fate of his 
family cannot be separated from that of the extended family (the Iraqi 
people)," he said, quoted by state television. The denial came after 
US Defence Department Spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said: "We have seen 
evidence that family members are fleeing the country, or trying to 
flee the country." In Kuwait, air raid sirens sounded for the first 
time since Saturday. A defence ministry spokesman later said an Iraqi 
missile had been shot down over southern Iraq. The US Army's elite 
101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign around Najaf after 
killing several opposition fighters and taking another 20 prisoner, 
military officials said. The "Screaming Eagles" began the third day 
of their campaign to secure the areas south and north of the Shiite 
Muslim holy city by sending in another battalion of Apache attack 
helicopters to support infantry troops. Najaf and Karbala, another 
Shiite pilgrimage city a further 80 kilometres (50 miles) closer to 
Baghdad, are considered vital to securing communication and supply 
lines in the push toward the Iraqi capital. South of the capital, 
US troops reported their first serious fighting with the Republican 
Guard, considered Iraq's most determined military unit and key to 
the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded 
or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 
80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around Karbala came 
as US armoured units finalised plans for a decisive thrust toward 
Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated near 
Najaf, to the south. In Basra, seen as key to controlling the southeast, 
British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements before making 
a final push to take the city. Flight Lieutenant Peter Darling said 
British troops were "nibbling at the edges" of Iraqi defences in the 
city of more than one million people which is seen as a vital staging 
post for humanitarian supplies. British commanders said 600 soldiers 
backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling to punch through 
the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the southeast 
of Basra, as British artillery pounded Basra's western edge. British 
forces in southern Iraq were swapping their helmets for berets as 
markets and schools reopened, officers said. An Iraqi military spokesman 
said at least 54 US and British soldiers had been killed in fighting 
since Sunday, most of them around Basra, with an unspecified number 
of others killed in other parts of Iraq. Officials in London said 
a British soldier was killed on duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 
the British death toll since the start of the war. US authorities 
say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. In Brussels, a diplomatic 
source said that US Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions 
on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers on Thursday. In Russia, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov said the war was likely 
to fuel North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Diplomatic sources in Jordan 
said authorities had foiled two Iraqi plots to attack US interests 
in its western neighbour, including a bid to poison the water supply 
of US troops and an attempted bombing of a luxury hotel. Asian stock 
markets and the dollar paused to catch their breath following their 
latest slump but oil prices edged higher as worries over the impact 
of war continued to shake confidence. burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap

The general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, Nong Duc 
Manh, will pay an official visit to China soon, the Vietnam News Agency 
(VNA) said Tuesday. Manh will go to Beijing "in the near future", 
it said without giving further details. The visit comes at the invitation 
of China Communist Party general secretary and state president, Hu 
Jintao, VNA added. Ideological soulmates but historical rivals, China 
and Vietnam fought a brief but bloody war along their common border 
in 1979 following a Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. They subsequently 
clashed over territorial claims in the South China Sea in 1988 and 
1992. But the relationships between the two countries have improved 
significantly recently, with Vietnam congratulating China's new leadership 
last year. dla/rcw Vietnam-China

Bangladeshi port authorities Tuesday detained a cargo ship from Cyprus 
for hitting another vessel and causing damage to a port jetty, harbour 
officials said. The 16,000-ton ship, MV Commander Express, was asked 
not to leave Chittagong Port until an investigation into the incident 
was complete, harbour master Kamrul Hossain said. The ship, with 26 
crew on board, had been sailing out of the port Tuesday when it hit 
the Bangladeshi state-own vessel Banglar Maya and then dashed against 
a nearby silo jetty causing serious damage to both, he added. The 
Cyprus flag carrier arrived in Chittagong from India last week carrying 
general cargo and was leaving for the Philippines. str/gt/an/rcw Bangladesh-Cyprus-ship

India Tuesday warned of "great consequences" of the decision by the 
United States and its allies to wage war against Iraq without broad 
international backing. "This unilateralism can have great consequences 
in times to come... who will have to face what, time will tell," Defence 
Minister George Fernandes told the Press Trust of India (PTI) news 
agency in an interview. Fernandes also criticised talk of reconstructing 
post-war Iraq as "cynical". When asked what India would contribute 
to the rehabilitation effort, he said: "Personally I have a sick feeling. 
This smacks of cynicism of the worst type. "You go and bomb, blow 
up the whole place and in the process kill several hundred mostly 
civilians in the war, a war which does not have the sanction of the 
UN... and just about every facility and infrastructure is destroyed. 
"And then people start talking of reconstruction and rebuilding," 
he said. India had taken a decision to provide relief and rehabilitation 
to the people of Iraq in whatever way it could, he added. Fernandes' 
remarks came a day after Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha said the 
United States and Britain had made a mistake by attacking Iraq. er/an/th

A director with Indonesia's central bank was jailed for three years 
here Tuesday after being found guilty of failing to properly monitor 
the liquidity of insolvent banks during the regional financial crisis. 
Hendro Budianto was guilty of "negligence in carrying out his job" 
as the director of banking supervision with Bank Indonesia and had 
caused 9.793 trillion rupiah (1.10 billion dollars) of losses to the 
state, said Judge Panusunan Harahap. Budianto had failed to freeze 
the accounts of 18 now-dissolved banks and had instead allowed these 
banks to continue their daily operations, Harahap told the Central 
Jakarta district court. Prosecutors had asked Budianto to be jailed 
for six years. He has one week to appeal. At the height of the Asian 
economic crisis in 1997-1998, BI had given 144.5 trillion rupiah (16.26 
billion dollars) of emergency liquidity support to numerous private 
and state banks to stop the banking system from collapsing following 
massive runs on deposits. State audits have shown that more than 95 
percent of the liquidity credits had been misused. Many of the loans 
were used for foreign exchange speculation, for lending to affiliated 
businesses and for repaying subordinate loans. Many other banks spent 
them on funding branch expansion, acquiring fixed assets and even 
for lending through the interbank market. str-vt/rcw Indonesia-graft

Coalition warplanes on Tuesday kept up heavy airstrikes on Iraqi army 
positions in and around the northern oil centre of Kirkuk, rebel Kurdish 
officials near the frontline said. The military officials said Kirkuk, 
now visible from advance positions of the pro-US Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK), had sustained a heavy bombardment overnight Monday 
and during the day Tuesday. Air attacks on Kirkuk have intensified 
in the past week, forcing the Iraqi army to roll back its forces that 
once overlooked this PUK-held town. PUK forces have now advanced to 
within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of Kirkuk, but have been targetted 
by sporadic Iraqi army rocket fire. sas/mb Iraq-war-Kurds-Kirkuk

Indian aircraft maker Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) said Tuesday it 
will invest nine billion rupees (187.5 million dollars) in the next 
three years to upgrade and modernise. "Unless we upgrade and modernise 
we will be totally out of business," HAL chairman N.R. Mohanty told 
reporters. "About 150 million dollars will be the capital investment 
needed to make the Sukhoi 30 Mk fighter jets and one billion rupees 
each will be earmarked for making the Light Combat Aircraft and Intermediate 
Trainer Jets," Mohanty said. India plans to locally build 140 Sukhoi 
30 Mk which will be handed over to the air force between 2004 and 
2017. HAL has paid a licence fee of 286 million dollars to Russia 
to be able to make the aircraft. India has been working for nearly 
two decades to build the Light Combat Aircraft, a single-seat aircraft 
considered an ideal frontline replacement for the Russian-made MiGs 
which dominate the Indian air force. It is expected to be in commercial 
production within two years. The Indian air force has placed an order 
for 12 of the new Intermediate Jet Trainers, which made its maiden 
public flight on March 21, and HAL plans to make about 200 after the 
first delivery scheduled for 2005. "All the funds will be met through 
internal accruals," Mohanty said. He said the state-owned firm clocked 
a 20 percent increase in net profit to 4.5 billion rupees during the 
financial year ended March 2003 compared with the last fiscal year. 
Revenues of the company soared eight percent to 30 billion rupees 
while exports shot up 53 percent to one billion rupees. "Today our 
thrust is to give finished products to the export market rather than 
making spares and components," Mohanty said. He said HAL was planning 
to make two hangars in Bangalore to bring all manufacturing and maintenance 
under one roof. "It will act as a centre of excellence and will help 
HAL to get more export orders," he said. jay/an/dv India-air-military

Six Indian Muslim clerics are ready to take food and medicines to 
Iraq to help civilians caught up in the war, their organisation said 
Tuesday. The six men are in the Jordanian capital Amman and got their 
visas Tuesday but are waiting for permission from the interior ministry 
to cross the border, said Sabir Yasin Nirban, secretary of the Raza 
Academy, a Muslim organisation based in the western city of Bombay. 
They are carrying nearly 600 kilograms of aid, mostly medicines donated 
by Bombay residents, with them, he told AFP over the phone from Bombay. 
"It's a small amount, but if it can help even one Iraqi child, our 
purpose would have been served," Nirban said. The men are also planning 
to act as human shields. Nirban said the Iraqi Ambassador in Amman 
met the group and was appreciative of their plan. pg/an/rcw Iraq-war-India-medicine

Russian media Tuesday drew satisfaction from the discomfort of US-led 
forces in Iraq, comparing the campaign to topple President Saddam 
Hussein to Moscow's decade-long effort to quell a separatist insurgency 
in Chechnya. Several analysts compared the mopping-up operations in 
southern Iraq with the notorious "zachistka", or sweeps, with which 
Russian troops rampaged through Chechen towns and villages in their 
efforts to track down and eliminate "terrorists." "The allies are 
starting their sweeps. The Americans and British are using the tactics 
of the Russians in Chechnya," the daily Izvestia headlined. A British 
special forces operation aimed at flushing out "Iraqi saboteurs" in 
Basra on Sunday was "almost the exact copy of the sweeps carried out 
by Russian troops in Chechnya," the paper said. "The British troops 
armed with automatic weapons burst into houses, kicking down doors, 
throwing everyone outside and forcing every male of fighting age to 
kneel," it noted. The daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted that "little 
by little the operation in Iraq is following the same track as the 
war in Chechnya." Warning that the Iraq conflict "promises to be long 
and bloody," Nezavisimaya noted that the "Shock and Awe anti-Saddam 
operation may become a repetition of our Chechnya epic: the longer 
the war goes on, the more the two sides will want to fight on to victory." 
Alexander Golts, a military analyst with the weekly Ezhenedelny Zhurnal, 
noted that "all the Americans need to do now to make the Russian generals' 
pleasure complete is to proceed to attack Baghdad. "Then our generals 
will be given a postdated blessing for their bloody assault that destroyed 
Grozny." The Chechen capital was virtually razed after Russia sent 
troops to put down a separatist insurgency in December 1994, and much 
of what remained or had been rebuilt was destroyed when hostilities 
resumed in October 1999 after a three-year ceasefire. Even now, and 
after suffering heavy losses, Russian troops maintain only a precarious 
hold on the republic. "The reports from the (Iraqi) theatre are deeply 
satisfying to the Russian general staff's operational department," 
Golts added. "The Iraqi military leaders appear to have learned well 
from our military academy, where we taught them that when the adversary 
is technologically superior, you must force him into low-level land 
combat, where he starts to suffer severe losses and has to halt the 
offensive," he noted. The business daily Vedomosti meanwhile headlined: 
"The war helps Russia, the Iraqi army is showcasing Russian weapons." 
The land war in Iraq "is good for Russian producers of anti-aircraft 
defence systems and armaments for land forces," it said. vvl-bb/hm/ns

Kuwait is sagging under the weight of popular Arab criticism for serving 
as the main launch pad in the war on Iraq but seems determined not 
to bow to regional pressure while battling its own isolation. With 
increasing worldwide opposition to the war, particularly in the Arab 
world, Kuwait is perceived as being partly responsible for the invasion 
of Iraq by hosting more than 150,000 of the coalition troops now advancing 
towards Baghdad. But the emirate is caught between a rock and a hard 
place, desperately seeking an end to Saddam Hussein's regime while 
trying to remain neutral in an increasingly ugly war it sees itself 
unwittingly drawn into. With a barrage of Iraqi missile attacks against 
Kuwait since the start of the 13-day war and mounting Arab condemnation 
of countries facilitating the US and British military operation, Kuwait 
has launched a diplomatic campaign. Senior officials are travelling 
to other Gulf states and the five permanent Security Council members 
to set out Kuwait's position on the conflict and shore up moral support. 
"We will not ask for any military forces from these countries, all 
we are asking for is at least to denounce this cowardly act" of Iraqi 
missile attacks, said First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Sheikh 
Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah. Sheikh Sabah also maintained that, no matter 
what, Kuwait cannot be isolated from the Arab world. "There might 
be incorrect stances by a number of countries but we should not mix 
matters," he said. "I think Kuwait took the right decision in supporting 
the coalition," said political observer Ahmad Bishara. "Kuwait has 
been a sitting duck for Saddam all these years" since Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait and seven-month occupation. "As far as the noise 
we're hearing from the so-called brethren, well we're damned if we 
do and damned if we don't," Bishara told AFP. Kuwait was under no 
obligation to appease other Arab countries at the expense of its own 
national security interests, he said. "There's no Arab consensus on 
anything, so why should we bank on it?" Kuwaiti isolation "doesn't 
matter very much," although its diplomatic drive, particularly in 
the Gulf, was an important move. Political science professor Ibrahim 
al-Hadban said every Gulf country had its own form of cooperation 
with the Americans and that Kuwait was being used as a "scapegoat". 
"Everyone is blaming Kuwait instead of blaming their own leaders and 
regimes," he said. Arab countries, Hadban argued, were not able to 
prevent the war or to convince Saddam Hussein to step down. "Then 
the war took place, whether Kuwait liked it or not. It's not because 
of Kuwait that the American and British armies came here and launched 
the war," he said. "It's very unfortunate that we'll be blamed for 
such action for a long time... The longer the war is, the more demonstrations 
we'll have and the more people will be upset with Kuwait," Hadban 
said. But it's a price the emirate will have to pay if it wants security 
through the fall of Saddam. "It's unfortunate that people can still 
defend a regime that has taken Iraq years backwards and has nothing 
to show the people of Iraq," said leading political science professor 
Shafeeq Ghabra. "At one point, it will be clear that Kuwait was right," 
he insisted, and it was nothing new for someone in the Arab world 
to be isolated. "There have always been complications between nation 
states and nationalism. It's an issue that has its own tensions, and 
its own merits and problems," said Ghabra. "I wasn't expecting that 
we would have an audience as this operation goes on. It's clear that 
there is still a model in the Arab world that respects people like 
Saddam, regardless of the suffering they cause. "We do pay a price 
for that, in our relations, in our position, in our status." Ghabra 
said there would be a time when the war ends, "and there will be an 
Iraqi voice that will appreciate the Kuwaiti position. "At some point 
the new government of Iraq will realise Kuwait was the country that 
stood for its liberation at the time when the rest of the Arab world 
didn't," he said. fm/mb Iraq-war-Kuwait-Arab
