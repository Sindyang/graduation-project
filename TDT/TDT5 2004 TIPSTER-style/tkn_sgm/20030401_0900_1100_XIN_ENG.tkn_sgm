As the United States-British military campaign in Iraq entered the 
13th day with hopes of a swift war fading away as a result of stiff 
resistance by Iraqis, fears in the country of the war's impact on 
growth prospects of the British economy are growing. Analysts here 
believe the growth of the British economy, which has been on a decelerating 
trend in the past three years against a background of global decline, 
would be further hurt as the war drifts into indefinite uncertainties. 
From 2000 to 2002, the British economy registered consecutive growth 
of 3.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. At the beginning 
of the year 2003, economists broadly expected the British economy 
to reverse the downward trend as the dampened world economy also entered 
a critical period for a long-awaited recovery. However, the economists' 
good-will expectations for a recovery conditional on a speedy finish 
of the war have been swept away by the reality in the battlefield. 
Global stock markets have been following a continuos plunge in the 
last few days while oil prices on world markets have been on an upswing 
because of fresh worries of potential impacts on the world economy 
if the US-led forces are mired in a protracted Iraq war. Shares of 
British companies were themselves gravely impaired as the lackluster 
mood in the markets pulled investors away from an earlier upbeat buying 
rebound when the war was expected to be brief. The rise of oil prices 
has increased industrial costs. British Chemical Industries, the largest 
chemical products company in the country, announced last week that 
its profits in the first quarter of this year were expected to decrease 
by 20 percent because of higher costs. Transportation and electricity 
businesses are also expected to be badly affected, business analysts 
said. The war produced more burdens for companies struggling to evade 
insolvency, especially those in the manufacturing sector, which is 
facing new rises in National Insurance (NI) contributions starting 
on April 6, under the government's fiscal budget of 2002-2003. A business 
survey conducted by the British Chambers of Commerce said 20 percent 
of businesses surveyed were considering dealing with the rise in NI 
contributions by cutting jobs. Others planned to cut salaries and 
reduce investment spending. The war also dampened business confidence, 
financial activities and investment intentions. The war budget is 
another factor casting gloom over the British economy. Britain so 
far has allocated three billion pounds (4.74 billion US dollars) for 
the war on Iraq. Analysts said the longer the war lasts, the heavier 
the funding burden would become, and this would add to the 8.7-billion-pound 
( 13.746-billion-dollar) budget deficit seen last year. Humanitarian 
and emergency aid as well as reconstruction in post-war Iraq will 
also cost British tax payers extra money, which might lower their 
consumption spending. According to Chancellor of Exchequer Gordon 
Brown's budget, the government would put more money into national 
medical care, education and security sectors to improve their service 
standards this year. So observers here believe the British budget 
would face a bigger black hole this year which in turn, might make 
government policy makers feel constrained when considering public 
investments. Fears about the war also shook the British consumers' 
confidence which had been the key to maintaining a rather vibrant 
economy compared with its industrial partners in the developed world. 
A survey by Martin Hamblin Gfk conducted between February 27 and March 
18, two days before the start of war in Iraq, showed that the war 
pushed British consumer confidence to its lowest level in seven years. 
Twenty percent of Londoners hunting for bargains in the January sales 
-- they had not been as eager even before the war started on March 
20 -- preferred staying at home now rather than going out in their 
spare time, another survey found. The sharp decrease of both foreign 
and domestic tourists suggests thinner business profits for hotels, 
restaurants and theaters, while the property markets, which came into 
a new booming cycle from the start of 2001, saw for the first time 
a zero prices growth in March. The business environment in continental 
Europe and the United States is very important for the economic growth 
of Britain whose exports and inward investments have mainly depended 
on the two economies. But so far all indications point to deteriorating 
economic prospects of both regions owing to a longer-than-expected 
Iraq war. The International Monetary Fund warned in its Global Financial 
Stability Report last Thursday that a prolonged war in Iraq could 
dampen the already fragile global economic recovery. If so, the British 
outward business environment would be even worse and its export market 
would shrink further, while inward investment would be harder to pick 
up. Economists here believe the adverse impact of war on the British 
economy has obviously been felt across-the-board by the Britons, although 
the extent of such impact is still unclear. Enditem

A Cuban airliner was hijacked by a man armed with two grenades on 
Monday night and ordered to fly to the United States, but it was later 
forced to land in the Cuban capital of Havana because of lacking enough 
fuel, Cuban officials said early Tuesday. The plane, now standing 
on the runway at Havana's international airport, had 46 passengers 
and crew aboard, an official statement read on Cuban television said. 
"According to reports from the plane, the (hijacker) is at the back 
of the plane, apparently holding two grenades," the statement said.

The Nepali government is planning to allow all children in the country 
to go to school by 2009 with the help of its donor countries and agencies, 
a senior Nepali government official said Tuesday. "In a close-door 
meeting between the government and its donors which concluded here 
recently, the donor countries reaffirmed their support to Nepal's 
latest move on education for all the children in the country," The 
Kathmandu Post newspaper quoted Ram Balak Singh, deputy director of 
the planning section in the Education Department, as saying. The donor 
countries agreed to the Nepali government's Concept Paper on Education 
for All Nepali Children, and they were keen on increasing their financial 
aid in the country's education sector, Singh said. The Department 
for International Development and Saving the Children Foundation were 
also willing to join the effort of Nepal 's major donor countries 
and international organizations including Japan, Norway, Sweden and 
the Asian Development Bank who are currently funding the Nepali government's 
Basic and Primary Education Program, he added. He said "The meeting 
with the donors focused mainly on intensifying decentralization of 
the public schools." The donors have committed 40 million Nepali rupees 
(513,000 US dollars) for handing over of 1,000 public schools to the 
local communities in Nepal in the next fiscal year beginning from 
July 16 this year. Enditem

As Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is spreading and more 
people were killed, Thailand has been on red alert against the epidemic 
even though it has no evidence of local transmission so far. On March 
31, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinwatra chaired a special meeting 
to work out ways to prevent the disease, which has infected more than 
1,600 people in 15 countries and killed 61. Many Bangkok residents 
have found their ways to deal with it -- wearing mask and canceling 
their trips to high-risk destinations. As results of Monday's special 
meeting, tougher screening has been introduced from Tuesday for passengers 
arriving from SARS- affected areas and 10 emergency teams of doctors 
from university, state and private hospitals have been set up to investigate 
any suspected cases. A quarantine station was set up inside the military 
base at Bangkok's Don Muang international airport, and arriving passengers 
suspected of having the disease will be held there for at least 24 
hours. In Chiang Mai airport, Songkhla airport and Mai Sai checkpoint 
in Chiang Rai province, 900 kilometers north of Bangkok, officials 
have received the same order. The Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan 
even warned that travelers from countries hit by SARS would be temporarily 
barred from entering Thailand if health authorities are not confident 
that their precautions can prevent the mystery disease from spreading 
locally. At the same time, Thais were also urged to avoid travelling 
to those destinations and those returning from outbreak areas were 
recommended to stay away from people close to them for at least 14 
days until it is clear they are not infected. Thai embassies and consular 
offices in high-risk areas were instructed by Thai Foreign Ministry 
to knock on the door of thousands of Thai workers to check on their 
condition and submit regular reports on their latest health situation. 
Moreover, Thai Airways International (THAI) announced Tuesday to canceled 
28 flights to Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and other cities affected 
by a deadly virus, noting the cancellations are also part of a set 
of measures to guard against SARS. Since the epidemic broke out in 
the southeast Asia this March, Thailand has implemented tough measures 
to prevent the disease. However, the atmosphere turned to anxious 
after local press reported that Italian doctor Carlo Urbani, who is 
also a World Health Organization communicable disease expert and was 
admitted to have caught SARS after he identified the virus in Hanoi, 
died last Saturday in Bangkok's Bamrasnaradura hospital. Following 
his death, all doctors and nurses at the hospital were required to 
take their temperature every hour to ensure they were free from the 
infection. Meanwhile, the reports about the outbreak of SARS began 
to draw more attention of the readers than the US-led war on Iraq. 
For the Thai government, the SARS is worse than the war as well for 
the economic reason. Thai Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha said 
the outbreak of SARS have a greater potential impact on the economy 
than the war in Iraq as the number of visitors to the country had 
fallen by between 5 and 10 percent for the disease. Enditem

A Tamil Tiger boat was sunk by Sri Lankan navy in a clash at sea in 
the east of the country on Monday, leaving three navy servicemen injured, 
a spokesman for truce monitors said on Tuesday. Teitur Torkelsson, 
spokesman of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission, said that the navy 
destroyed one boat of the suspected Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) rebels Monday evening when they returned fire after three or 
four rebel boats fired at the navy's "Lanka Muditha'' carrying about 
1,700 troops from Trincomalee in the east to the northern Jaffna peninsula. 
Out of the three injured, one was seriously injured in head, he said. 
He said that truce monitors met LTTE rebels in the rebel-held northern 
town of Kilinnochchi on Monday and the rebels said they were "surprised" 
with the clash and they were not involved in the incident. The government 
and the LTTE rebels have been observing a ceasefire since February 
last year before the peace talks between the two sides commenced in 
September. The talks are aimed at ending the country's 19-year ethnic 
conflict that have claimed more than 64,000 lives. The rebels, who 
have been fighting for a separate homeland for the Tamils in the north 
and east of the country, have agreed to settle for regional autonomy 
under a federal system. On March 10, the navy destroyed a LTTE vessel 
smuggling weapons with 11 rebels killed on board off Mullaitivu in 
the north of the country. Subsequently a Chinese fishing trawler was 
sunk in an attack by suspected LTTE rebels, killing 15 Chinese and 
two Sri Lankan nationals, in the same area on March 20. Enditem

The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) has commissioned an 
independent survey on preferred styles of beach volleyball attire 
in order to assess the preference of players, coaches and the general 
public of the growing sport. The survey, conducted by the company 
M.I.S. Trend based in Lausanne, Switzerland, was made in response 
to debate among male players last season concerning their own style 
preferences. The survey, which reached out to some 7,000 people posed 
questions related to fashion versus the sport's image, as well as 
considering the suitability of a design to allow for maximum athletic 
performance. Seventy percent of those who responded to the survey, 
including beach volleyball players, coaches and other interest groups, 
voted to keep the status quo (dress regulations state men's shorts 
should be cut 15 centimeters above the kneecap), rather than going 
for the longer baggy-style shorts. They said that it was best for 
playing the game and best for both the player's image and the image 
of the sport. Women prefer shorter shorts. Contrary to the opinion 
of some male players last season, the survey clearly showed that women 
prefer shorter shorts. Some 82 percent of women voted for short shorts, 
while 67 percent of men responding to the survey also preferring the 
current style. Professional beach volleyball players were split on 
their preference with only 48 percent backing the short shorts while 
amateur players, spectators and coaches voted 76 percent in favor 
of preserving the current style. T-shirts, yes or no. The survey posed 
the question of whether male players should play topless, but 62 percent 
of the general public and coaching and amateur playing fraternity 
prefer to retain the current style of men wearing tops. Women were 
somewhat cooler on the subject of tops for men, with 44 percent expressing 
a preference for no t-shirts, while professional players came out 
strongly in favor, with 64 percent telling M.I.S. they would prefer 
to play topless. Enditem

by Sun Yongming DAR ES SALAAM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite having 
signed a ceasefire, the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army and the Hutu 
rebels have intensified their military actions in recent weeks, making 
the prospects for a lasting peace in Burundi look dismal. At least 
68 members of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), the largest 
Hutu rebel movement in the tiny central African country, were killed 
in the fierce fighting last weekend with the army to the northeast 
of the capital Bujumbura, according to a Burundian army spokesman. 
The fighting was confirmed by a FDD spokesman who, however, said that 
seven army soldiers were killed in the exchange of fire and the Burundian 
army had exaggerated the losses of the FDD side. Two pupils and one 
teacher were killed last week when the FDD members launched a sudden 
attack on a government army checkpoint near a primary school near 
Bujumbura. The two parities accused each other of violating the ceasefire 
signed on Dec. 3 of last year in Arusha, north Tanzania after hard 
negotiations mediated by a facilitation team headed by South African 
Deputy President Jacob Zuma. As a result of the recent clashes, a 
new wave of refugees rushed into western Tanzania, which has already 
sheltered as many as 300,000 Burundians fleeing the devastating ten-year 
civil war. Last Saturday alone, a total of 168 Burundians were registered 
as refugees in Kigoma, some 60 km south of the Burundian border. The 
refugees said the fighting between the government army and the FDD 
had intensified over the past days. Burundi's civil war broke out 
in October 1993 when then president Melchoir Ndadaye, the first ever 
democratically elected president in the turbulent country, was assassinated 
by Tutsi soldiers. Being in minority, Tutsi, accounting for only 16 
percent of Burundi's population, has been ruling the country politically 
and militarily, but several months, since it gained independence from 
Belgium in 1962. The United Nations statistics show that at least 
250,000 people, mostly civilians, have lost their lives in the conflicts 
between the army and Hutu rebel groups. Moreover, the exodus of large 
numbers of refugees has caused many problems to other countries in 
the Great Lakes region. Thanks to the painstaking efforts by the regional 
leaders, the Burundian government headed by President Pierre Buyoya 
and FDD led by Pierre Nkurunziza inked a ceasefire agreement in Arusha, 
kindling hopes for restoring peace and order in the war-torn country. 
The promise for peace, however, proved that fragile for the two parties 
of the ceasefire began to attack each other in various parts of the 
country, prompting calls for a peacekeeping mission to prevent the 
train to peace from derailing. Last month, Burundian Vice President 
Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu, asked African countries to send a peacekeeping 
force to help restore peace and stability in the country during a 
meeting with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa in central Tanzanian 
city of Dodoma. Briefing Mkapa, also a leading mediator of the Burundi 
peace process, on the latest developments in Burundi, Ndayizeye said 
an African Union peacekeeping force is of vital importance for saving 
the shaky ceasefire between the government army and Hutu rebels. Some 
African countries have showed their willingness to participate in 
the future peacekeeping mission in Burundi, but so far, there has 
been no indication from these countries on the approximate date for 
the deployment of the peacekeeping troops. South Africa deployed 700 
troops in Burundi in November 2001 to protect those returning politicians 
from possible attacks from their rivals. In view of the deep-rooted 
mistrust between Hutu and Tutsi, it is naive to imagine that the ceasefire 
itself could soon straighten out all problems left over by history. 
As a matter of fact, gunfire had begun to roar before the ink was 
hardly dry. In accordance with the power-sharing agreement, Ndayizeye 
should replace Buyoya, a Tutsi, as the president on May 1. However, 
Buyoya has recently hinted that he may not step down as planned due 
to the intensified conflicts. The remarks made by Buyoya add more 
uncertain factors to the staggering Burundi peace process. Enditem

An expedition from southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region left 
here on Monday for Nepal, for their planned attempts on the 8,463-meter 
Mount Makalu at the Himalayas later this year. The expedition planned 
to arrive in Nepalese capital Katmandu on April 5 and the 5,100-meter 
base camp at the foot of the Himalayas at the Chinese-Nepalese border, 
at about April 15. The Chinese expedition will set up five camps in 
the mountain area for their attempts on the world's fifth highest 
peak sometime between April 16 to June 2, with dates to be decided 
upon local weather conditions. The team will return to Lhasa in mid-June. 
Mt. Makalu is a highly difficult peak for climbers and is known of 
frequent avalanches in the area. After failed attempts by British, 
French, American and New Zealand teams, nine French climbers became 
the first group to make it to its summit in May 1955, from the northwest 
face in China. The Tibetan region's expedition, found in 1993 has 
set a target of scaling all the 14 peaks 8,000 meters and above in 
the world. They have made it to 11 of them so far. The expedition 
made a failed attempt on the peak in September 1996. They gave up 
their efforts after reaching the height of 6, 000 meters, due to bad 
weather and lack of supplies. Enditem

Myanmar needs to place special emphasis on strengthening the national 
economy and developing science and technology under the present uncertain 
world economic situation, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar 
reported on Tuesday. In its editorial, the paper pointed out that 
owing to a vast global gap in economy and wealth, there lacks equal 
opportunities among the nations of the world. "The world's economic 
powers discriminate developing nations economically as well as politically 
and are essaying to enlarge their sphere of influence," it said. The 
paper attributed the existence of instability in international community 
and considerable uncertainty about economy and future to the double-standard 
treatment of big nations toward developing ones. As a result, each 
nation is forced into a position to resort to protectionism, it said. 
It said the Myanmar government is working toward a strong national 
economic life by encouraging the private sector as well as the government 
economic organizations to develop. The paper also emphasized the need 
to reinforce such resistance power as national defence and national 
solidarity. Enditem

The US-led coalition forces on Tuesday launched a new round of massive 
bombardment on Baghdad and the southern city of Nasiriya, while 10 
British paratroopers were reportedly killed near Nasiriya by local 
tribes. At least 10 missile hit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad at around 
7 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), after a relatively quiet night in the 
city, a Xinhua reporter said, adding that the targets were not known 
yet. US and British warplanes flew over the sky and dropped bombs 
on the city, home to 5 million people. Iraqi anti-air defense forces 
fired back at the warplanes. Loud explosions reverberated through 
the city, and a number of military and government buildings were hit 
in the bombing. A telecommunication center was also bombed in the 
air strike and the telephone communication was temporarily cut off, 
said the Xinhua reporter. In Alamwe district, southeast of Baghdad, 
the US bombing killed 4 children and wounded a number of civilians. 
Some people were crying on the demolished houses, eye witnesses said. 
The coalition forces also intensified bombardment on Nasiriya, 375 
km southeast of Baghdad, leaving 24 civilians killed and 116 others 
wounded, Iraqi television reported. In Baajh, northeast of Nasiriya, 
local tribes attacked the British paratroopers who were trying to 
land in the area. 10 British paratroopers were killed in the crossfire, 
said the report. Iraq has staged stiff resistance against the US and 
British troops, who have been managing to move northward toward Baghdad 
to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in its central and southern 
key cities over the past 13 days since the outbreak of a US-led war 
on Iraq on March 20. Enditem

A Cuban airliner was hijacked by a man who claimed to armed with two 
grenades on Monday night and ordered to fly to the United States, 
but it was later forced to land in the Cuban capital of Havana due 
to lacking enough fuel, Cuban officials said early Tuesday. The plane, 
now on a tarmac at Havana's international airport, had 46 passengers 
and crew on board, an official statement read on Cuban television 
said. The statement said the Soviet-made AN-24 was on a regular passenger 
flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the 
pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked to the United States 
by a man armed with grenades. "According to reports from the plane, 
the (hijacker) is at the back of the plane, apparently holding two 
grenades," the statement said, adding that the authorities were negotiating 
with the hijacker. "The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake 
the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and 
lives of passengers and crew members," said the statement. On March 
19, another passenger plane from Cuba with 31 passengers and six crew 
members aboard was hijacked by six people and later landed at Key 
West International Airport in Florida, the United States. Enditem

The East African Customs Union, an arrangement to remove trade barriers 
among the three east African countries, is expected to be set up in 
November this year, reported the New Vision newspaper on Tuesday. 
Chairman of the Uganda group of the East African Legislative Assembly 
(EALA) Yona Kanyomozi was quoted as saying that plans to remove trade 
barriers in the region were in advanced stages. "In November this 
year, there is a likehood that the customs union will be established. 
Internal barriers among the countries will be removed so that we become 
one," he said. He said a common external tariff would be introduced 
to protect trade among the member countries. However, EALA members 
said the political federation of east Africa would take time. "A political 
federation cannot happen overnight," Maxwell Mwatela, a Kenyan representative 
to EALA was quoted as saying. The three east African countries are 
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Enditem

Eight major Chinese aluminum smelters have announced that they will 
close all their high energy- consuming and polluting aluminum electrolysis 
potlines with a combined capacity of 450,000 tons per annum by the 
end of 2005. Yunnan Aluminum Co., Ltd., Fushun Aluminum Smelter, Chalco 
Shandong Co., Baotou Aluminum Group Co., Qingtongxia Aluminum Group 
Co., Lanzhou Aluminum Co., Ltd., Lanzhou Liancheng Aluminum Co. and 
Tongchuan Xinguang Aluminum Co. Ltd have a combined aluminum electrolysis 
capacity of 1.04 million tons per annum, accounting for one fifth 
of the national total of 5.3 million tons per annum. Their Soderberg 
capacity is 450,000 tons per annum, one fourth of the national total 
of 1.3 million tons per annum. Unlike prebake potlines, Soderberg 
potlines have fluoride, SO2, and dust emission much higher than allowed 
by the State Environmental Protection Administration standards. Pollution 
aside, Soderberg technology also features low productivity, high material 
and energy consumption and inferior product quality. The fact that 
China's Soderberg capacity accounts for one- fourth of its total aluminum 
capacity is regarded as quite incompatible to the country's status 
as the largest aluminum producer in the world. Kang Yi, president 
of the China Nonferrous Metal Industry Association, noted that China's 
aluminum production capability increased by nearly two million tons 
per annum in the past two years and mostly employs the environment-friendly 
prebake technology. The aluminum capacity expansion has not seen an 
accompanied increase in pollution. "The phase-out of the old Soderberg 
potlines is not only a commitment of China's aluminum industry to 
the environment," Kang said. "It will also lift the industry's technical 
standards and sharpen its international competitiveness." Enditem

A policy being drafted by the Ugandan government will give internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) the freedom to choose where to live, reported 
the New Vision newspaper on Tuesday. Ugandan government officials, 
donors and non-governmental organizations representatives met here 
on Monday to scrutinize the draft national policy on the IDPs. The 
policy was drafted after recommendations by a study commissioned by 
the United Nations organization and the Ugandan government to analyze 
the situation of IDPs over a year ago. The policy will oblige the 
central and local authorities to protect the IDPs wherever they will 
be. Opening the meeting, Ugandan Second Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Internal Affairs Lt. Gen. Moses ALi said Uganda had suffered 
civil strife, cattle rustling, drought and other disasters since the 
1970s. He said over 7 million people have been victims of displacement. 
Statistics disclosed by the meeting showed that between 1971 and 1979 
an estimated 2 million people were internally displaced. Between 1981 
and 1986, about 830,000 people were displaced by war and insurgency. 
The Alice Lakwena resistance and Lord's Resistance Army wars displaced 
800,000 people from 1989 to date in the north. The Allied Democratic 
Forces resistance in the western Rwenzori region also displaced 150,000 
people from 1984 to 2000. The policy is a response by the Uganda government 
to the need to devote attention to the rampant internal displacement 
of persons. It will minimize internal displacement and its effect 
on victims of natural and man-made disasters. Enditem

The world's overweight could achieve significant weight loss through 
living in a low-oxygen plateau environment for a period of time, according 
to the latest medical research. In 2002, the plateau medical research 
center of Qinghai Medical College surveyed 115 workers engaged in 
the construction of the Qinghai-Tibetan railway on China's western 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "world's roof". The survey indicated 
an average weight loss of 10.2 percent of bodyweight after one month 
of hard work at an altitude of 4,000 meters. Professor Gerili, director 
of the plateau medical research center, said that those surveyed were 
living in normal working conditions. "None of those surveyed had undergone 
especially intense exercise or diets of any kind," Gerili added. According 
to the survey, people from regions located at altitudes of 2,000 meters 
or more were not as sensitive to the plateau environment as those 
from the plains. The former registered a 2.3 percent average weight 
loss at an altitude of 4, 000 meters. The results also indicated that 
those with more excess weight lost more weight in the plateau environment. 
Gerili explained that anoxia, or lack of oxygen, is the main factor 
leading to weight loss. "Anoxia discourages appetite, increases energy 
consumption, weakens the absorption functions of the stomach and intestines 
and disturbs normal water metabolism, all of which contribute to the 
weight reducing effect," Gerili said. It is also not hard to understand 
why people living in low- oxygen plateau environments are physically 
fit, said the professor. He suggested that body-building and weight-loss 
centers be built on the plateau, where obesity can be easily overcome 
through pleasant recreational activities and moderate physical exercise.

The Iraqi capital of Baghdad was under a new round of air raids by 
coalition forces Tuesday morning, a Xinhua correspondent said. Explosions 
were heard in northern and western Baghdad at about 8:50 a.m. (0550 
GMT), and Iraqi anti-aircraft forces opened fire skyward. Baghdad, 
home to 5 million people, has been under devastating bombings daily 
over the past 13 days since the outbreak of a US-led war on Iraq on 
March 20. Iraq has since fought against the invaders in its central 
and southern key cities, who have been managing to move northward 
toward Baghdad to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Defying international 
opposition, the United States and Britain launched the war under the 
pretext of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has 
denounced the invaders as "criminals" and "villains," while urging 
the international community to stop the "aggression" unconditionally.

Jiuzhaigou, a popular scenic tourist site in southwest China's Sichuan 
Province, has invested more than 100 million yuan (12.09 million US 
dollars) in environmental protection over the past three years. The 
great effort has helped retain the beauty of local lakes, lofty mountains 
and dense primitive forests, which attract huge crowds of tourists 
from both home and abroad. Located in Nanping County and covering 
more than 60,000 hectares, Jiuzhaigou is known as "a fairyland in 
the world, and a world of fairy tales" for its charming waterfalls, 
colorful forests and cloud-capped peaks. It was placed on the World 
Heritage list in 1992 and included in the world biosphere network 
in 1997. Several years ago, the scenic site launched a program to 
re- convert sloping hills to forest, and, beginning early this month, 
the scenic site administration started demolishing 100,000 square 
meters of hotels, restaurants and other infrastructure facilities 
in the scenic area to restore natural beauty. To reduce environmental 
damage caused by humans, only 12,000 tourists per day are allowed 
to enter the scenic zone, according to Feng Gang, deputy director 
of the Jiuzhaigou Scenic Zone Administration. The scenic zone has 
installed environmentally-friendly toilets, including eight mobile 
toilets, to reduce pollution by tourists. These toilets cost an estimated 
20 million yuan (2.41 million US dollars). Jiuzhaigou has established 
special stations to monitor plant diseases and insect pests, as well 
as the ecological environment. A climate monitoring station was also 
built at a cost of one million yuan (120,000 US dollars) at the end 
of last year. The station will provide information on rainfall, temperatures 
and weather to tourists. Enditem

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has appointed Ignatius Chombo, 
a cabinet minister, to double as the acting Minister of Higher and 
Tertiary Education after the post fell vacant following the death 
of Swithun Mombeshora two weeks ago, according to the Herald newspaper 
on Tuesday. The report said that Mugabe assigned all the functions 
of the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education to Minister of Local 
Government, Public Works and National Housing Chombo. Mombeshora died 
at his Harare home on March 17 and was declared a national hero. He 
was buried at the National Heroes Acre four days later. Meanwhile, 
Chombo on Monday held a meeting with the Association of University 
Teachers at University of Zimbabwe to discuss the current impasse, 
which led to the closure of the campus after the lecturers went on 
strike. "We want to get to the bottom of the issues and see if we 
can come up with solutions to the problems," he said. The lecturers 
went on strike on February 24 citing irregularities in the awarding 
of a retention allowance. A retention allowance is only given to medical 
academic staff and not the rest of the lecturers. Enditem

The United States has been putting pressure on Syria by accusing it 
of supporting Iraq with military supplies, which diplomatic sources 
here deemed as a sign of US dissatisfaction with Syria's staunch opposition 
to the US- led war against Iraq. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 
said on Friday that shipments of equipment, such as night-vision goggles, 
had been crossing into Iraq from Syria and that Damascus would be 
held accountable for such "hostile acts." Syria has dismissed the 
US charges, calling them an attempt to divert attention from the hardship 
its forces are facing in Iraq and to cover up "ugly war crimes" against 
Iraqi civilians. Syria, currently the only Arab member of the UN Security 
Council, has led Arab opposition to the Iraq war. Before the war started, 
Syria made great efforts to seek a political and peaceful solution 
to the Iraqi crisis. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, at an Arab 
summit, has called on the Arab states not to provide convenience for 
the US invasion of Iraq. Assad said the Arab world should take a firm 
stance toward the United States, because, besides Iraq, other Arab 
countries might also be put on its hit list. Assad said recently that 
Iraq has the capacity to force the US and British troops out, and 
called on the Arab world to back Iraqi people in their resistance 
to coalition forces. Though the US Army has kept a watchful eye on 
the road between Baghdad and the Syria-Iraq border and continued bombing 
bridges and vehicles there, Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri, in 
disguise, managed to arrive in Damascus via the road, and after meeting 
with Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, 
went to Cairo for a foreign ministers' meeting of Arab states. Syria 
joined the US-led forces in the 1991 Gulf War, but has since improved 
ties with Iraq. It has voiced strong support for Iraq since the war 
began 12 days ago and allowed volunteers to cross its border to fight 
for Iraq. Most of the 400 to 500 people crossing the Syrian border 
into Iraq are Iraqis, while some of the others are Palestinian and 
Syrian volunteers, reports said. Washington lists Syria as a state 
sponsor of "terrorism" for its support of the Lebanese guerrilla group 
Hizbollah and of pro- Palestinian groups that it hosts. The US motive 
in carrying out the Iraq war, Assad said, is to control the oil resources 
and reshape the political situation in the Middle East, and then to 
control the region and the world. Since he came to office in 2000, 
Assad has been working to form a Damascus-Baghdad-Teheran strategic 
security axis, and he deems Iraq as Syria's strategic strength. Analysts 
said if Iraq failed to get strong support from the Arab world, its 
current administration might be overthrown by coalition forces. Once 
that happened, Syria, which sees itself as a champion of Arab nationalism 
and a rampart against US ally Israel, might be next on Washington's 
hit list. Therefore, Syria's support to Iraq is based on its own national 
interests, the analysts added. Enditem

Sirens sounded in Kuwait City Tuesday morning, a Xinhua correspondent 
said. Earlier in the day, an Iraqi Scud missile was shot down by Patriot 
air defense batteries deployed in Kuwait, Abu Dhabi TV channel reported. 
Dozens of Iraqi missiles have been fired into Kuwait since a US- led 
coalition started invading Iraq from the oil-rich emirate on March 
20. Most of the projectiles fell into Kuwaiti desert, and some were 
intercepted by Kuwait's anti-missile systems. But a low-flying short-range 
missile ploughed into Sharq Market in Kuwait City days ago, causing 
panic among the Kuwaitis. Defying international opposition, the United 
States and Britain launched the war under the pretext of disarming 
Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has denounced the invaders 
as "criminals" and "villains," while urging the international community

Zimbabwe is expected to receive a significant chunk of 55 million 
US dollars allocated to the African Capacity Building Foundation by 
the World Bank, local media reported on Tuesday. Among some of the 
organizations that will receive the funds are the National Economic 
Consultative Forum (NECF) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic 
Development Policy Unit. The Southern Africa Regional Institute for 
Policy Studies is already benefiting from the fund. The ACBF's executive 
secretary, Soumana Sako, said on Monday that Zimbabwe was eligible 
to get support for new projects under the fund. "Zimbabwe is a member 
of the World Bank and besides the ACBF is an autonomous body which 
will determine who receives support and who does not," he said. The 
Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) is set to get 2 million US dollars 
over three years while the policy unit in the Ministry of Finance 
and Economic Development will receive 1.5 million US dollars. The 
TNF seeks to strengthen the capacity of the National Economic Consultative 
Forum to enable it to operate effectively and efficiently through 
providing a consultative platform to interface with existing organizations. 
The unit in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development is expected 
to assist the ministry, the Reserve Bank and economics department 
at all the country's universities in policy formulation and analyze 
macro-economic fundamentals. "The recruitment of the staff is now 
complete and what is left is the launch of the unit which will be 
done soon," Sako said. He said the establishment of the unit that 
was mooted in 2000 had taken long due to a number of problems, which 
included getting approval from the foundation's board of directors. 
The ACBF is also considering several other projects, which have been 
submitted from various sectors. The grant was extended through a memorandum 
of understanding that was signed by officials from both organizations 
in Harare on Monday. Sako signed on behalf of the foundation while 
Ohene Nyanin, the country manager for Zimbabwe and Zambia, signed 
on behalf of the World Bank. The 55 million US dollars, which would 
be disbursed over a five- year period, was the second and last tranche 
of the 2.7 million US dollars that was availed to the ACBF by the 
World Bank in 1999. Sako said the money would be kept in the foundation's 
trust fund and disbursed to countries that submit sound capacity building 
projects. "We are a demand-driven organization as opposed to supply- 
driven which means that the country that submits the most attractive 
projects would get more support," he said. The ACBF was established 
in 1991 through the collaborative efforts of the African Development 
Bank, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, bilateral 
donors and African governments. The foundation represents a response 
to the severity of Africa' s capacity problems and the challenge to 
invest in indigenous human and institutional capacity in sub-Saharan 
Africa. The foundation's mission is to build capacity for sustainable 
development and poverty reduction in Africa. Enditem

With governmental guidance and technological support, China is trying 
to erect a national boundary to reign in the Internet, which has long 
been considered a cyber territory with no demarcation line between 
countries. The boundary, consisting of various government-sponsored 
efforts to exercise cyber monitoring or limiting, aims to find and 
sanction vicious Internet-based activities which are harmful to China 
and its people's interests, said Hu Mingzeng, director of the Computer 
Network and System Security Research Center at Harbin Industrial University 
in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. While recognizing that 
the Internet can significantly promote China's social progress and 
connection to the outside world, the government is also paying more 
and more attention to criminal acts and other minor wrongdoings that 
it brings about, said Hu. Dubbed "a message splitting the Great Wall", 
China's first electronic message was sent abroad via the Internet 
in 1987, followed by nationwide connection in 1994. The latest statistics 
from the China Network Information Center show that by late 2002 there 
were 59.1 million Internet users across the country. A survey by Web 
Side Story, a US-based Internet analysis organization, revealed that 
China's huge information transport via the Internet has made it the 
second world cyber power after the United States. (more)

However, some of its innate characteristics, such as real-time, cheapness, 
anonymity and wide access, have made the Internet a seedbed for illegal 
activities. In China, more than 80 percent of all personal computers 
have suffered virus attacks or hacker invasions, causing a loss to 
its financial industry of more than 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US 
dollars) every year. To date, China has enacted more than ten national 
or local laws and regulations which specify information protection 
as an obligation of network operators, information providers and connected 
users. According to these laws, Net-based acts, including gambling, 
spreading pornography, unauthorized logging-in, fraud, tip-offs of 
state secrets, terrorism and government subversion, would be followed 
up and those who commit such acts would be fined or sent to prison. 
China has established a special cyber police force to intensify real-time 
monitoring, to intercept and delete harmful information and to capture 
and check illegal server data. Heilongjiang's law enforcement departments 
are ready to gradually bring the increasingly diversified wrongdoings 
into their jurisdiction, said Li Shilin, a provincial police officer 
responsible for supervising network security. Technological support 
plays an essential role in achieving such goals, said Hu, adding that 
the existing technological system is competent for accomplishing related 
security missions. Hardware and software solutions can help Internet 
police monitor and collect evidence, namely by observing keyboard 
clicking, tracing the wrongdoers, sounding the early alert and carrying 
out special tasks, according to Hu. The privacy of common people is 
totally out of said scope, said Juris Yu Ning from Jilin University, 
in Heilongjiang's southern neighboring province. "It simply functions 
against wrongdoing," he said. Enditem

Primitive microbes found in rocks covered by the sea 1.4 billion years 
ago are providing support for the theory that life may have originated 
in a type of "underwater chimney", Chinese scientists said recently. 
The "geological evidence" found on rocks near the Great Wall in northeast 
China challenges the prevailing theory that evolution depended exclusively 
on sunlight, said Li Jianghai, professor with the earth and space 
institute attached to the elite Beijing University. The fossilized 
microbes, only microns in size, appeared bulbiform or filiform under 
an electronic microscope. They had been "capable of surviving in extreme 
conditions devoid of sunlight and oxygen, but with extreme temperatures 
and pressure." The microbes obtained energy and nutrients through 
the conversion of toxic gas, usually sulfured hydrogen, emitted from 
" black smoke-emitting chimneys" and was fatal to common life, according 
to Li. The international scientific circle has long studied the mystery 
of the origin of life: how primitive organisms survived the earliest 
harsh climates, a time when there was little oxygen in the earth's 
atmosphere and no ozone shield sheltering terrestrial life and shallow 
water organisms from the sun's lethal ultraviolet radiation. The finding 
at the foot of the Great Wall has supported the theory that deep-sea 
floors are the source of the earliest life on earth. (more)

The Uganda Presidential Peace Team (PPT) has asked the rebel Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA) to give a date and alternative venue for their 
first meeting with the northern elders and parliament members, reported 
the government newspaper New Vision on Tuesday. In a letter written 
by the PPT to the LRA high command through the northern paramount 
chief in response to the LRA demand for an unconditional ceasefire 
in north on March 30, PPT acting chairperson Betty Akech who signed 
the letter said the PPT were happy to receive the first letter from 
the LRA high command. She said this showed LRA's commitment and willingness 
to resolve the ongoing rebellion peacefully. "The PPT assures the 
LRA commanders that everything possible will be done through negotiation 
to see that peace prevails in the north," she added. It was recalled 
that the LRA has written to the PPT, asking the government to expand 
the ceasefire to cover the entire northern region. The just ended 
4th National Conference of the ruling Uganda National Movement on 
Monday adopted a resolution, calling upon the LRA to take advantage 
of government's offer of negotiated peace settlement and to reciprocate 
by appointing their peace negotiating team. Enditem

Experts said the finding was significant to the understanding of life's 
origin and to the exploration of exotic life forms on other planets. 
"It revealed good prospects for the search for lower life forms in 
places other than on earth," Li said. "We have a lot of work to do 
in the coming months, including a profound field survey and the examination 
of characteristics and types of the fossilized microbes," Li noted, 
adding that comparative research was also being considered to study 
the relationship between relevant records and microorganisms currently 
living in hydrothermal vent locations in the ocean. Since microbe-type 
organisms were able to survive without sunlight and oxygen on ancient 
earth, it is also possible to find similar lower life forms or fossils 
thereof on other planets. The research of Li's international counterparts 
have confirmed the possibility of finding similar organisms on Mars 
and Jupiter, both of which have an environment similar to that of 
the prmitive earth, according to Li The researchers discovered a large 
number of live microorganisms and their fossils near hydrogen-spewing 
"chimneys" on the ocean floor, and laboratory testing proved they 
possessed the most primitive genome on earth. Enditem

The Bangladeshi government suffered a financial loss of some 770 million 
US dollars in 440 corruption cases in 2002, the Financial Express 
said Tuesday. A report issued by the Transparency International Bangladesh 
( TIB) was quoted as saying that the amount of financial loss by corruption 
is equivalent to 10.38 percent of the total allocation in the national 
budget and 67 percent of the foreign aid received in the country in 
fiscal 2001-2002. Law-enforcing agencies have been considered as the 
most corrupt ones as usual, followed by local governments and education 
departments. The TIB's report was based on the 2,778 reports on corruption 
published in 17 national newspapers and six regional ones in 2002. 
Of the total, 440 cases identified by the TIB caused 770 million dollars 
in loss to the government. Authorities were found to have taken actions 
against corruption in only 29.3 percent of the cases reported in the 
newspapers. The TIB has strongly advocated the formation of an independent 
anti-corruption commission, appointment of ombudsman, more press freedom 
and separation of the judiciary from the executive to reduce corruption.

An interim government led by Abel Goubma has been set up in the Central 
African Republic (CAR), according to a report from Bangui, capital 
of CAR, on Tuesday. The cabinet, which is made up of 28 ministers, 
includes some coup leaders and heads of parties. Goubma, a retired 
professor of medicine, was appointed as the prime minister in March 
by Francois Bozize, who proclaimed himself president of CAR after 
his forces seized the capital city. Goumba was the leader of the Patriotic 
Front for Progress, a major opposition party in the country and a 
strong critic of former president Ange-Felix Patasse, who remains 
in exile in Cameroon. In March, forces loyal to Bozize, the former 
army chief of the country, drove into Bangui, occupied the airport 
and Patasse's residence before taking over the whole city. Patasse 
was attending a summit meeting in Niger when the incident took place, 
and later, he was forced to fly to Cameroon after his plane was shot 
at over Bangui airport. Enditem

Former Zambian president and veteran African politician Kenneth Kaunda 
has condemned the US-led war in Iraq as "savage" and "evil", major 
Zambian newspaper The Post said Tuesday. In a telephone interview 
from Boston University in the United States, Kaunda said he had decided 
to join the worldwide anti-war demonstrations because US President 
George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are exposing 
American and British people to a great danger. "It is a savage war 
because people being bombed are innocent children, women, men and 
the aged," Kaunda said. "It is not only the Iraqis who are being murdered...What 
about those young men in uniform from the US and British armies who 
are losing their lives through the barrel of the gun?' He disclosed 
that while in London recently, he joined over 2 million British people, 
among them family members of soldiers, in demonstration against the 
Iraqi war. Noting the majority of the American people are opposed 
to the war, Kaunda asked the Zambians not to demonizing the American 
and British people" because they are not in support of this savage 
war. " Kaunda dismissed the search for weapons of mass destruction 
as the reason behind the war against Iraq. "All they want is to recolonize 
Iraq so that they can get free oil," he said. Enditem

With a little more than a year to go before the 2004 elections, the 
Commission on Elections (Comelec) has yet to receive money to implement 
the absentee voting law, Philippine officials said Tuesday. "Overseas 
absentee voting is not feasible at this time because we have not received 
a single centavo for its implementation," the Philippine Daily Inquirer 
quoted Comelec chair Benjamin Abalos as saying. Abalos said the Philippine 
Department of Budget and Management appropriated only 400 million 
pesos (7.46 million US dollars) in the 2003 national budget for the 
purpose of conducting the voting abroad. The amount, he said, was 
not enough to finance the preparations for absentee voting. Comelec 
has asked Congress for a budget of one billion pesos ( 18.66 million 
dollars) for this year's preparations, which include the purchase 
of machines, the printing of application and registration forms, and 
the training of all foreign service personnel who will oversee the 
electoral process abroad. The absence of funds for the exercise was 
very critical as the absentee voting law, signed by Philippine President 
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in February, specified the time frame for 
its implementation, commissioner Florentino Tuason said. According 
to the law, registration for the absentee voting should start on May 
5. "It's already April and we still have not printed any forms," Tuason 
said. Preparation for the registration is expected to take seven to 
ten weeks. Abalos said the commission was all set to implement the 
law, only did not have the money to do so. Seven million Filipino 
workers abroad could participate for the first time in the national 
polls. Arroyo is set to sign the 2003 national budget in April. Enditem

Due to the global economic slowdown, political risks, stock market 
collapse and corporate scandals in the United States, economic researchers 
said they have taken their toll on global foreign direct investment 
(FDI). The UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) warned in a 
press release issued recently that it will take the global FDI five 
years to fully recover, but stressed that FDI into the developing 
world has held up much better, with China and eastern Europe the star 
performers. The United States suffered FDI inflows drop by almost 
80 percent in 2002, FDI inflows fell by 45 percent in 2001, and by 
a further 22 percent in 2002 to an estimated 580 billion US dollars, 
it said. China, Mexico, Brazil, Russia and India will be the five 
emerging markets that make it into the top 20 recipient countries. 
"FDI inflows into China reached a record 54.7 billion US dollars in 
2002, and will continue to expand strongly over the medium term," 
the EIU said. The trend towards better business environments, regional 
integration, technological change, industrial consolidation, sharper 
global competition, and opportunities in emerging markets are the 
factors underpinning renewed strong expansion in global FDI, it said, 
adding a recovery will begin during 2003, and accelerate from 2004. 
It estimated the growth in global FDI in 2003-07 will be much stronger 
than the growth in world trade or GDP. In the next five years or so, 
FDI into the European Union as a whole will also be significantly 
higher than the United States during the period from 2003 to 2007, 
it said. "The EU will also continue to outstrip the US as source region 
for direct investment. FDI will remain geographically concentrated, 
" it said. Commenting on the run-up leading to the war against Iraq 
and the ensuing uncertainty, the EIU said the uncertainty contributed 
to the overall decline in FDI in 2002. The high oil risk premium and 
the impact on overall confidence shaved about half a percentage point 
off world growth over the past year. Enditem

ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- US Secretary of State Colin Powell is 
coming to Ankara for an unexpected visit on Wednesday, designed principally 
to win support for opening a northern front in the war against Iraq. 
After the United States faced a serious resistance in southern Iraq, 
US officials have begun concentrating on the plans of the northern 
front, reported the Turkish newspaper Cumhurriyet (Republic) on Tuesday. 
During Powell's stay in Ankara, issues such as deployment of US soldiers 
in Turkey, dispatch of US soldiers to northern Iraq via Turkey and 
use of Turkey's airbases for air strikes against Iraq were expected 
to be on the agenda, Turkish government sources said. The Turkish 
parliament on March 1 rejected a government motion on allowing the 
deployment of 62,000 US troops in Turkey for opening the northern 
front in the war against Iraq. On Powell's coming visit, Turkish Prime 
Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that the United States could 
make new requests, but he did not disclose the content of the requests. 
The US Administration, disappointed over the developments in the southern 
front in Iraq, decided to send Powell to Turkey in order to improve 
relations and garner more support for the Iraq war which has entered 
the 13th day since its outbreak on March 20. Enditem

A nest-like architecture scheme for the main stadium of the 2008 Olympics 
has been pre-approved by the Beijing public during a design show here, 
beating the other two favorites by the smallest margin. The architecture 
plan, co-designed by Swiss company Herzog &amp; De Meuron and China 
Architecture Design Institute, won 3,506 votes for the first place 
from over 6,000 visitors to the six-day exhibition, which closed on 
Sunday, to become the favorite design of the National Stadium for 
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The design stood out with its unique 
nest-like exterior, which encloses the stadium with curved steel-net 
walls. It was also one of the three winners picked by an official 
evaluation panel from 13 ones in a design competition prior to the 
exhibition, which had a total of 13 designs on show to solicit public 
opinions and suggestions. The design submitted by the Beijing Architecture 
Design Institute won 3,472 votes while 3,454 votes went to the scheme 
from a consortium of Japanese AXS Company and Tsinghua University 
Architecture Design Institute. "It is so beautiful. The longer I watch 
it, the better I like it," a lady said, standing before the winning 
architecture model. "It is awfully good. I have never seen stadiums 
like this before." It was natural, however, that there was someone 
disagreeing. "It is like a bird cage. If I have to see it every time 
I look out of my window, I am afraid I need to move somewhere else," 
a man living near the site of the future National Stadium grunted. 
But there was another man understanding the design from a different 
aspect. "I'd rather say it is a nest than a cage. I think it carries 
the implication of the nest where a new life is growing up. It is 
really a good idea," said the third. Enditem

Exchange (TSE) edged up 0.96 point, or 0.12 percent, to 788.96. Some 
blue-chip issues including Toyota Motor and TDK drew buying on dips,

The munitions with Jordanian mark reportedly found in Iraq, if proved 
to be true, must date back to pre-embargo period, a senior Jordanian 
official was quoted as saying by the Jordan Times on Tuesday. "If 
any old stocks are found, they certainly date back to the period when 
there was no embargo on Iraq and consequently no embargo on shipments 
of military equipment," said Mohammad Adwan, minister of state for 
political affairs and minister of information. Referring to media 
reports that a cache of munitions marked " Jordan Armed Forces" was 
found near the Iraqi city of Basra, Adwan told Times that "we cannot 
confirm that this information is accurate." Iraq was imposed on an 
arms embargo following its troops' invasion into Kuwait, where it 
was forced out by US-led coalition afterwards in early 1990s. Twelve 
years later, the country, which borders on Jordan in the northeast, 
once again met with a US-led coalition who was launching a massive 
military campaign to disarm Iraq of the alleged weapons of mass destruction.

Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and visiting former Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday discussed the need for boosting 
bilateral trust in dealing with political issues as well as energy 
projects, Kyodo News reported. "I told Yeltsin we should map out activities 
through which we can develop trust and sign a bilateral post-World 
War II peace treaty," Koizumi was quoted. The premier also said after 
the meeting at his office they discussed the need for negotiating 
the issues in line with bilateral documents including the 1993 Tokyo 
Declaration, which acknowledges the territorial dispute between Japan 
and Russia and commits the two countries to working out a peace treaty. 
During their meeting, Koizumi and Yeltsin talked about a plan to construct 
crude oil pipelines in Siberia and transport natural gas to Japan 
from Sakhalin, Kyodo said. Yeltsin said he and Koizumi also discussed 
bilateral cooperation in various sectors such as politics, culture, 
defense and industry. Enditem

All villages in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region are to have 
clean drinking water supplies by 2005 under an ambitious project to 
improve their lives of villagers. Since 2000, Tibet Autonomous Region 
has been undertaking a project to provide sanitary drinking water 
to local villages. The project is scheduled to be completed by 2005 
and costs 480 million yuan (57.83 million US dollars), said an official 
from the regional government office in charge of the issue. Over 3,000 
drinking water distribution points would be built in rural areas, 
the official said. In 2000, the regional government conducted an investigation 
to see how many people and livestock were drinking the same water. 
A shortage of sanitary drinking water had been hindering the development 
of the rural economy in Tibet, said a local government official from 
the Qamdo Prefecture. Since the peaceful liberation in 1950 of Tibet, 
the regional government has tried hard to supply clean drinking water 
to all Tibetans. So far, 243,000 rural people and five million livestock 
in Tibet have been covered by the sanitary drinking water network.

An unarmed Iraqi driver was killed by US marines at a checkpoint south

a pickup truck speeding towards them at a checkpoint outside the southern 
Iraqi town of Shatra, killing the driver and wounding his passenger, 
CNN said. The truck was not loaded and neither of the men was armed, 
the report added. On Monday, US troops opened fire on a car which 
failed to stop at a checkpoint near Najaf, about 160 kilometers to 
the south of Baghdad, killing seven Iraqi women and children. US troops 
had tightened security measures at checkpoints since an suicide bomber 
last week exploded his car at a checkpoint near Najaf and killed four

Following are the latest key developments relating to Iraq war: CAIRO 
-- An Iraqi Scud missile was shot down by Patriot air defense batteries 
deployed in Kuwait early Tuesday, according to Abu Dhabi TV monitored 
here. Dozens of Iraqi missiles have been fired into Kuwait in retaliation 
since the US-led coalition started the invasion of Iraq from the neighboring 
Gulf state on March 20. Most of the projectiles fell into the Kuwaiti 
desert and some were intercepted by Kuwait's anti-missile systems. 
- - - - BAGHDAD -- Iraq on Tuesday denied that any family member of 
President Saddam Hussein has left the country after the beginning 
of the US-led war on Iraq. A spokesman for the Iraqi Presidency said 
the family of President Saddam Hussein "is part of the big family 
of the Iraqi people" and "the fate of the small family cannot be isolated

press reports that some family members of President Saddam Hussein 
have left Iraq. - - - - CAIRO -- The Iraqi capital of Baghdad was 
under a new round of bombardment by coalition forces Tuesday morning, 
al-Jazeera TV channel reported. Two huge explosions were heard on 
the southern outskirts of Baghdad, where some of Iraq's elite Republican 
Guard are believed to be deployed to defend the city, it added. Baghdad, 
home to 5 million people, has been under devastating bombings daily 
over the past 13 days since the outbreak of a US- led war on Iraq 
on March 20. Iraq has since fought against the invaders in its central 
and southern key cities, who have been managing to move northward 
toward Baghdad to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. - - - - LONDON 
-- A British soldier was killed on Monday when he was on duty in southern 
Iraq, pushing the death toll up to 26 since the war against Iraq began 
13 days ago, the British Defense Ministry announced here Tuesday. 
- - - - BAGHDAD -- The US-led coalition forces on Tuesday launched 
a new round of massive bombardment on Baghdad and the southern city 
of Nasiriya, while 10 British paratroopers were reportedly killed 
near Nasiriya by local tribes. At least 10 missile hit the Iraqi capital 
of Baghdad at around 7 a.m. local time (0400 GMT), after a relatively 
quiet night in the city, a Xinhua reporter said, adding that the targets 
were not known yet. US and British warplanes flew over the sky and 
dropped bombs on the city, home to 5 million people. Iraqi anti-air 
defense forces fired back at the warplanes. Loud explosions reverberated 
through the city, and a number of military and government buildings 
were hit in the bombing. A telecommunication center was also bombed 
in the air strike and the telephone communication was temporarily

Macao's Health Services has asked the Macao EVA Airways to provide 
the name list of passengers aboard the BR826 jetliner from Macao to 
Kaohsiung after a Taiwanese passenger aboard the plane was announced 
to have fallen victim to atypical pneumonia. The Taiwan health department 
announced Monday the 13th pneumonia victim found in Taiwan, a 60-year-old 
woman, and began to trace people who has had direct contacts with 
her. In a coordinative effort, the Health Services of the Macao Special 
Administrative Region government asked the air company to help investigate 
the flight taken by the woman. Meanwhile, Macao residents have been 
appeased that there is no need to be alarmed by the incident, since 
after ten days of the latent period of the disease passed, no suspect 
case of the pneumonia infection has been reported by hospitals in 
Macao. The SAR has remained intact after the epidemic broke out in 
the surrounding regions. But it has been on high alert of the disease 
control. Jetboat companies operating routes between Hong Kong and 
Macao have for the first time asked passengers to fill in forms of 
personal information including name, address, phone number and the 
seat number that they choose to take on jetboats. The nervous atmosphere 
has imposed pressure on Macao's tourism. Some tourist agencies complained 
that passenger arrivals via the ports linking to Hong Kong dropped 
by half during last weekend compared with normal. But there are also 
others claiming that a new source of tourists emerged as some retired 
Hong Kong people seeking refuge for a short stay in Macao. Enditem

360 health care assistants, reported Hong Kong's media Tuesday. The 
funding also includes treatment costs averaging 14,000 HK dollars 
(1,795 US dollars) per patient and the cost for diagnostic tests at 
500 HK dollars (64 US dollars) per case. More than 250 members of 
the Auxiliary Medical Service and Civil Aid Service will be mobilized 
at a cost of 46 million HK dollars (5.9 million US dollars) to work 
at border control points and to handle persons who fall sick or show 
symptoms of viral pneumonia. Enditem

Four types of companies listed on China's A-Share market will be popular 
with overseas institutional investors, including those having an industry 
monopoly, such as over airports, harbors and expressways, said a leading 
investment bank. In its research report on China's A-Share market 
disclosed in mid-March, UBS Warburg singled out preferential choices 
of shares on that market, which has a capital value of 500 billion 
US dollars. UBS Warburg was one of the first group of applicants for 
QFII ( Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) status, and is still 
awaiting approval from Chinese regulators, including the central People's 
Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the 
State Administration of Foreign Exchange. According to the report, 
the other three types of companies were those "with Chinese characteristics", 
for example, alcohol producers and cheap-labor textile enterprises, 
companies that own valuable self-developed brands, and companies engaged 
in resources development like coal mines and iron mines. "We hope 
to get overseas investors who are interested in Chinese stocks into 
the A-Share market as soon as possible," said Yuan Shuqin, the manager 
in charge of Warburg's QFII application. Yuan's bank offered a variety 
of funds for clients who could be an indirect China market investor 
through purchasing shares of one or more these funds. The bank is 
planning to employ three more staff to conduct A- Share research exclusively 
and to give ratings on A-Share companies, according to Yuan. (more)

Deutsche Bank had announced a 50 million US dollars fund earmarked 
for A-Share business in anticipation of obtaining a QFII license. 
Based on the German bank's survey and analyses of over 1,200 listed 
companies on the A-Share market, some 40 to 50 were of investment 
value, according to Zhang Lihong, general manager of the bank's China 
operations. Despite most Hong Kong and Taiwan-based dealers being 
out of reach of QFII status because of the huge capital required, 
they were still major authors of research reports on the A-Share market 
thanks to their close relations with the stock markets on the mainland. 
"We know exact detailed information about domestic industries and 
the flux of overseas direct investment, and we have kept long- term 
business relations with would-be A-Share investors abroad," a Hong 
Kong analyst said. The Taiwan-based CSC International Holdings Ltd. 
said it began research on A shares in the second half of 2000, and 
has since compiled each year the report on China industries in the 
English language and investment guide books in Chinese. Economists 
said the China A-Share "fever" was a result of China 's economic success 
amid a shaky global economy. Especially under the impact of the Iraq 
war, China achieves stability and sustained economic growth. Qiu Yanying, 
a researcher with the leading Huaxia Securities Institute on the mainland, 
said the QFII is the best chance for vast overseas institutional investors 
to get involved in the A- Share market, and this "fever" will become 
even more intense as QFII becomes operational. Enditem

ABOARD USS KITTY HAWK AIRCRAFT CARRIER (GULF), April 1 (Xinhua) -- 
An S-3B Viking aboard the USS Constellation veered off the flight 
deck Tuesday morning after making an arrested landing, said a press 
release from the US Naval Forces Central Command based in the Fifth 
Fleet. Shortly after touching down on deck, the S-3B malfunctioned 
while taxiing on the carrier's flight deck and slid to the left side 
of the deck, the press release said. The plane went over the side, 
hit flight deck safety netting and went into the water, but ejected 
the two pilots onboard into the water, it said. A HS-2 helicopter, 
performing search and rescue operations for the flight cycle, arrived 
on scene immediately. Both pilots were rescued by a Search and Rescue 
swimmer and transported to Constellation, it added. No personnel on 
the flight deck was injured and the cause of the S-3B malfunction 
was under investigation, the release added. The S-3B Viking performs 
multiple missions, including tanking support, anti-submarine warfare, 
electronic support measures and precision strike. The USS Constellation 
is currently deployed in the northern Gulf. Enditem

Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Al-Bashir is due to arrive here 
Wednesday on his one-day state visit to Kenya, the Sudanese embassy 
in Nairobi disclosed Tuesday. During his stay, Al-Bashir is expected 
to meet his Kenyan counterpart Mwai Kibaki and discuss with him wide 
range of issues including the ongoing Sudanese peace talks, which 
sponsored by the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
and held in Kenya's capital Nairobi. The Sudan People's Liberation 
Army (SPLA), based in southern Sudan, has been fighting for more autonomy 
from the central government in Khartoum. The conflict between the 
government and rebels, combined with disease and famine, has taken 
around 2 million lives since 1983. Last July, the Sudanese government 
and the SPLA began peace talks under the auspices of IGAD, a six-member 
regional group in East Africa, which groups of Ethiopia, Eritrea, 
Djibouti, Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda. Kenya is the current chairman 
of the IGAD ministerial sub-committee on the Sudan. Al-Bashir will 
be the first head of state to visit Kenya since President Kibaki assumed 
power at the end of last year. Enditem

A Kuwaiti Patriot battery intercepted and destroyed an incoming Iraqi 
missile before it entered the Kuwaiti airspace from southern Iraq, 
a Kuwaiti army spokesman said Tuesday. Lieutenant Col. Awadh al-Mututah 
said that Iraq launched the missile at 9:05 a.m. local time (0605GMT). 
Sirens wailed for five minutes starting from 9:06 a.m. local time 
(0606GMT) in Kuwait City, only one minute after the missile was intercepted. 
Earlier in the morning, Kuwait said it fired a Patriot missile on 
Monday night after a sentry near its border with Iraq reported what 
he thought was an incoming missile flying below radar level. A Kuwaiti 
military spokesman said the Patriot missile eventually detonated itself 
without intercepting any incoming missile. On Saturday, a low-flying 
Silkworm missile coming from Iraq hit a shopping mall in Kuwait City, 
the first time that a missile was so close to the city since the US-led 
war on neighboring Iraq started on March 20. Two people were slightly 
hurt. Since March 20, at least 18 missiles coming from Iraq have been 
fired at Kuwait, a key launch pad for the US-British coalition forces' 
invasion of Iraq. Most of them have been intercepted by Patriot missiles.

A painting show was held in the Jin Tai Art Museum of Beijing Tuesday 
to mark the Islamic Republic Day of Iran, with more than 60 miniature 
and watercolor paintings by well-known Iranian artists Mahmoud Farshehian 
and Nasrin Dastan. According to the organizer, as an important component 
of Persian art, Iranian miniature painting originated from the border 
pattern of the Koran. It features brilliant colors and is fancifully 
decorative, similar to the traditional Chinese realistic paintings 
characterized by fine brushwork and close attention to detail. Farshehian, 
born in 1930, was once a student of Prof. Yimani, a master of traditional 
painting, and later furthered his study in the Isfahan Art Academy. 
He is adept in commanding beautiful lines and his use of color gives 
the impression of wild dancing. His works reveal the secrets existing 
deep in the heart of men and various creatures, as well as the conflicts 
and combats between good and evil, beauty and ugliness and knowledge 
and ignorance, which are the constant themes of Iranian art. In 1993, 
the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) 
published a book for Farshehian and UNESCO director-general Federico 
Mayor praised him as "a world artist". The 35-year-old Nasrin specializes 
in portraying flowers and natural scenes, which show the artistic 
perspective of a Muslim woman. Nasrin said she loves Chinese culture 
and once gave her own exhibition in China. In 2002, she studied for 
a doctorate in Chinese art history at the China Central Academy of 
Fine Arts. Ferydoun Verdi Nejad, Iranian ambassador to China, said 
that both Iran and China have profound ancient culture and have witnessed 
a long-term friendship. Both Iranian and Chinese art focus on humanism, 
the spirit of creatures and the theme of peace. He also expressed 
his hope that the painting show would strengthen communication between 
the arts circles and peoples of the two countries, as well as the 
traditional friendship. Enditem

More and more missiles and bombs battered Baghdad and the southern 
city of Nasiriya into Tuesday as the US-British forces stepped up 
the pummeling of the Iraqi leadership. Explosions were heard in northern 
and western Baghdad at about 8:50 a.m. (0550 GMT), and Iraqi anti-aircraft 
forces opened fire skyward, a Xinhua correspondent said. Meanwhile, 
the US Central Command said in a statement that coalition forces had 
used "precision-guided munitions to target an Iraqi government complex 
in eastern Baghdad. The complex served as an office location for Baghdad 
leaders and housed the youth ministry and the Iraqi National Olympic 
Committee, chaired by President Saddam Hussein's elder son Uday. Baghdad, 
home to five million people, has been under devastating bombings daily 
over the past 13 days since the outbreak of a US-led war on March 
20. The coalition forces also intensified bombardment on Nasiriya, 
375 km southeast of Baghdad, leaving 24 civilians killed and 116 others 
wounded, Iraqi television reported. In Baajh, northeast of Nasiriya, 
local tribes attacked the British paratroopers who were trying to 
land in the area. Ten British paratroopers were killed in the crossfire, 
said the report. In another development, Iraq denied on Tuesday that 
some family members of President Saddam Hussein have left the country 
after the beginning of the war. A spokesman for the Iraqi Presidency 
said the family of President Saddam Hussein "is part of the big family 
of the Iraqi people" and "the fate of the small family cannot be isolated 
from the fate of Iraqi people." The denial followed Western press 
reports that some family members of President Saddam Hussein have 
left Iraq. Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said a number 
of Arab volunteers have arrived in the southern province of Qadisiya, 
some 180 km south of Baghdad. The agency said the Arab volunteers 
have expressed their insistence to sacrifice themselves in defense 
of Iraq and the principles of Islam. Official reports in Baghdad said 
over 5,000 Arab volunteers from all Arab countries have arrived in 
Iraq to fight against the US and British troops. Iraq has since fought 
against the invaders in its central and southern key cities, who have 
been managing to move northward toward Baghdad to oust President Saddam. 
Defying international opposition, the United States and Britain launched 
the war under the pretext of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. 
Iraq has denounced the invaders as "criminals" and "villains," while 
urging the international community to stop the "aggression" unconditionally.

on Tuesday. Al Ahram: -- Shura Council approved the Egyptian-European 
Association agreement Monday. Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros 
Ghali said talks are underway with a number of the European countries 
to provide jobs for the Egyptians. Addressing the council, the minister

Al Gomhuria: -- Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Ahmed Beltagui said war

50 percent in March, and hotel occupancy went down to 40 percent. 
The Egyptian Gazette: -- President Hosni Mubarak warned that a protracted 
war in Iraq would lead to an increase in terrorism throughout the

The Tanzanian police have arrested 12 foreigners who were found living 
in Dar es Salaam Region without residence permits, local newspaper 
Daily News reported on Tuesday. These aliens were nabbed during a 
crackdown launched in collaboration with the Immigration Department, 
Regional Police Commander Alfred Tibaigana was quoted as saying on 
Monday. "The crackdown aims at netting all aliens who are residing 
in the country illegally." the regional police chief said. He said 
that these aliens were from Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia, 
Britain and Uganda and they were found staying in different guest-houses 
in the capital city. Tibaigana disclosed that the crackdown follows 
an alarming increase in robbery incidents in the city, often implicating 
foreigners. Enditem

South Africa's trade balance widened to 2.65 billion rand (330 million 
US dollars) in February, boosted by exports which grew by 8.02 percent 
compared to January. Local Business Day newspaper reported Tuesday 
that the export growth was supported by vehicle, machinery and precious 
metal sales. The report said that although the country's currency 
rand gained 40 percent against US dollar last year, it appeared to 
have made no dent on February's 23.65 billion rand (2.95 billion dollars) 
surge in exports compared to 21.89 billion rand (2.73 billion dollars) 
in January. But economists expect the trade balance to come under 
some pressure later in the year as weakening global demand cuts into 
export growth. A prolonged war in Iraq will exacerbate global economic 
conditions by delaying a recovery. Enditem

Tourists who want to visit the Mogao Grottoes in northwest China's 
Gansu Province without a reservation will find them hard to enter 
since a booking system for the grottoes was launched Tuesday. Liu 
Huilin, deputy director of the China Dunhuang Studies Institute, said 
that the system aims to relieve the pressure of the peak tourism season. 
Researchers have found that besides sand, wind, rain and insects, 
touching and condensed breathing of visitors are also the causes for 
the deteriorating grotto murals. From 2000, the Dunhuang Studies Institute 
divided its 50 already opened grottoes into eight visiting routes 
for tourists, but this effort did not curb the pressure from the high 
tourism season, when over 3,000 tourists are received daily. Liu suggested 
that Chinese and overseas travel agencies apply for reservations from 
the Dunhuang Tourism Bureau, or else his institute will reject their 
tourists. The grottoes hold 45,000 square meters of murals and 2,000 
figurines that were made from the fourth to 14th centuries. They have 
been added to UNESCO's world cultural heritage list and have attracted 
thousands of visitors from around the world. Enditem

Editor's Note: On the occasion of the first anniversary of the launching 
of the Human Rights magazine, the journalists of Human Rights interviewed 
the Australian, Egyptian, Hungarian and Indonesian ambassadors, and 
Mexican minister to China. Following are their points of view on China's 
human rights situation. Mr. David Taylor Irvine, Australian Ambassador: 
Improved observance of human rights will inevitably accompany the 
economic reform and opening up that China is embracing. Australia 
particularly welcomes the increased personal freedoms that the Chinese 
people now enjoy. The freedom to choose where to work and where to 
live, to make individual decisions about lifestyle, and the freedom 
to travel in China and abroad are now enjoyed by the Chinese people 
and have done much to transform the face of Chinese society. Likewise 
Australia welcomes the efforts China has made to advance the social, 
economic, and cultural rights of its people, the measures it has taken 
to protect the rights of women and children, and the relative freedom 
of religion the Chinese people now enjoy. Considerable work is also 
being done to implement the concept of the Rule of Law in China. China's 
observance of some human rights, such as those that relate to freedom 
of speech, assembly and association, has improved over the pre-reform 
era. But, as with many countries, continuous work needs to be done 
to ensure that practices in China conform with all the universally 
accepted standards of human rights. Australia is happy to work together 
with the Chinese government and people on these issues. Mr. Aly Houssam 
El-Din El-Hefny, Egyptian Ambassador: In general, the present human 
rights situation in China has been developing side by side with the 
positive development of the whole society. China's economy has developed 
rapidly and the living standards of both the urban and the rural residents 
continue to improve. The Chinese government has always paid full attention 
to the problems of poor rural population. Consequently, the number 
of poor population has been steadily reduced over years. The medical 
and health services have also continued to improve, and the mean life 
expectancy reached 72 years, which is rapidly approaching the 75 years 
level of the developed countries. The Chinese government has protected 
as well the right to work. The number of total employment has been 
increasing despite of the on-going economic reform, taking into consideration 
the ever increasing reemployment rate in new jobs. At the same time, 
the social security system, including the pension insurance, the unemployment 
insurance and the medical insurance, is improving. The sector of education 
has also witnessed tremendous improvement. The compulsory education 
projects in impoverished areas, for example, have been extended. The 
illiteracy rate among the Chinese people has dropped to almost 4.5 
percent, which is an excellent achievement. China also gives priority 
to promoting the legal system to ensure civil and political rights 
according to law. All competent international circles acknowledge 
the progress made by China's government to enhance the rule of law 
along the whole country. At the same time, significant efforts have 
been exerted by the Chinese government to ensure the equal rights 
of the ethnic minorities, which already enjoy the right to regional 
autonomy. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have strengthened their 
efforts to fight poverty in ethnic minority areas. In such areas, 
the protection of the freedom of religious beliefs and practices is 
fully ensured. Such regions also formulate their own regulations concerning 
family planning. To sum up, I can say that I am deeply impressed by 
the achievements of modern China, by its reform and opening up, as 
well as by its unprecedented positive developments of the various 
aspects of human rights in the country and wish this friendly country 
and people more achievements especially realizing Xiaokang by the 
year 2020. (more)

Mr. Mihly Bayer, Hungarian Ambassador: The situation of human rights 
in China changed a lot during the past decades. Thanks to the legal 
reform opened in 1978, Chinese law has grown markedly in terms of 
quantity and quality. In the quarter century since the end of the 
Cultural Revolution, the PRC has engaged in the single most concerted 
national effort in terms of legal development in Chinese history. 
The results are impressive and they benefited the whole Chinese society. 
Hungary has observed the Chinese efforts with great sympathy and is 
ready to share her experience gained in the last decade during the 
transition to democracy, rule of law and market economy. China and 
Hungary, two traditional friends, whose recent history and the challenges 
they had to surmount in the past have many common features. This is 
the reason why our two countries started a dialogue on human rights 
in 2000. We consider the open and constructive exchanges of views 
on human rights issues with China helpful to both sides. The Hungarian 
experience proved that a well functioning market economy and the rule 
of law are closely linked with each other because the market mechanisms 
can only work in a regulated and calculable legal environment. I am 
convinced that China is on the best way towards the full application 
of these ideas, even if her historical and cultural background is 
quite different from that of Hungary. Mr. Aa Kustia, Indonesian Ambassador: 
Most of the developing countries have enjoyed progress on human rights 
situations in their countries, particularly China who has been developing 
its economy so fast in the past years. The Chinese people have what 
is enjoyed by the people in developed countries. They are free to 
go everywhere and free to do what they like as long as they observe 
the law and regulation in the country. Mr. Jose Oramas Cadena, Mexican 
Minister: China and Mexico share the same constructive position regarding 
this topic, and look forward to find more cooperative ways in pushing 
forward a positive support for the protection and promotion of human 
rights. In September 2001, the Mexican Vice Minister for Human Rights, 
Mariclaire Acostaa, visited China and held a series of very fruitful 
meetings with Chinese officials and organizations on human rights. 
We have set as a priority to proceed with this dialogue. During the 
said visit, the Mexican side was deeply impressed by the progress 
made by China in the protection and promotion of people's rights to 
subsistence and development; the protection devoted to ethnic minorities 
and the effective means to grant them autonomy in different levels 
of self-government; as well as wide religious freedom. On the other 
hand, it is important to point out that both countries, as developing 
nations, support the same position that human rights should not be 
a pretext to intervene in the internal affairs of any country. We 
are well aware of China's unremitting efforts to build a well-off 
society in an all-round way, including further develop the economy, 
improve democracy, advance science and education, enrich culture, 
foster social harmony and upgrade the texture of life for the people, 
together with the rule of law and the rule of virtue, as was stated 
in the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. With 
these solid foundations China is witnessing an unwavering improvement 
in human rights compared to the situation before 1949. Enditem

Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said on Tuesday his country 
is ready to discuss with US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Iraq-related 
issues during his coming visit. However, there was no any planned 
thing about Powell's visit, scheduled for Wednesday, said Gul, who 
is also deputy prime minister. Gul made the remarks when he was meeting 
with Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO) Executive Board Chairman Tanil 
Kucuk and members of the board. Responding to reporters' questions 
following the meeting, Gul said "Powell will pay a visit to an allied 
country." "This visit will be very beneficial to remove some hesitations," 
he said, adding that it would be beneficial both for Turkish and American 
public opinions. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will meet with 
Powell at 11:00 a.m. (0900 GMT) Wednesday. Asked about Powell's coming 
visit on Monday, Erdogan said the United States could make new requests, 
but he did not disclose the content of the requests. The US-led military 
action against Iraq is expected to high on agenda during the meeting. 
After the United States faced a serious resistance in southern Iraq, 
the US military has begun concentrating on the plans of the northern 
front, local media said on Tuesday. Powell's visit is reportedly aimed 
to win support for opening a northern front in the war against Iraq 
and improve relations between the two countries. Enditem

Participants of the ongoing four- day Pesticide Action Network Asia 
and the Pacific (PAN AP) Congress Tuesday called on the US-led coalition 
to stop its war against Iraq, saying the action is a crime against 
humanity. The participants made their common statement which was read 
by Dr. Irene Fernandez, founder and director of a women's organization 
fighting for the rights of workers in Malaysia and chairman of the 
steering committee of PAN AP, the Philippines News Agency reported. 
Fernandez said the military action against Iraq "is an unjust, immoral 
and illegitimate war" that is causing the destruction of lives, properties 
and the environment. The movement leaders also called on United Nations 
Secretary General Kofi Annan to immediately convene the UN General 
Assembly. "We call for the immediate stoppage of the war, withdrawal 
of all US troops and the UN to lead to the restoration of the legitimate 
rights and needs of the people of Iraq," she said. Fernandez said 
their group supports all peace-loving people in relentlessly resisting 
"this heinous crime against humanity, the violence, the waste and 
the blasphemy against genuine democracy and human rights." The congress, 
which opened Tuesday in Manila, is being participated in by more than 
120 people from Asia and the Pacific, mostly movement leaders from 
the peasant, women, indigenous, and fisheries and agricultural workers' 
organizations. Enditem

Security around the British embassy in Tehran was tightened on Tuesday 
after a small truck smashed into the embassy's main gatepost and burst 
into flames Monday night. A British diplomat said that extra security 
guards had been placed on duty inside the compound and police had 
also beefed up security around the perimeter. He added that the British 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office was considering to send some non-essential 
diplomatic staff home. On Monday night, a small truck loaded with 
two large barrels of diesel fuel smashed into the British embassy, 
in which the 35-year- old driver was killed. Iranian officials said 
that initial evidence did not suggest it was a terror attack, but 
an accident. "The investigations until now do not indicate that this 
was a deliberate attack," said Ali Taala, general director of security 
and political affairs at Tehran's governors office. Enditem

Air New Zealand has stocked its planes with masks in the past week 
as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) illness continues 
to cause international concern. Airline spokeswoman Val Hayes said 
Tuesday that the decision to have masks available on its planes had 
been a company initiative. Asked how many masks were on board each 
plane, she said enough were being carried for them to be used in the 
way Air NZ intended. "If there was a suspected incident the crew would 
use them as a precautionary measure, and likewise passengers nearby," 
Ms Hayes said. The airline's approach to coping with the potentially 
fatal pneumonia-type illness was welcomed by the Flight Attendants 
and Related Services Association. Since an announcement last week 
that a Singapore Airlines flight attendant became infected with Sars 
on a March 14 flight between New York and Frankfurt, cabin crew at 
several airlines have stepped up demands that they be provided with 
masks for their own protection. New Zealand health authorities announced 
Monday new rules that they had the power to detain and isolate anyone 
suspected of having the Sars virus, or to isolate others in contact 
with an infected person. The new rules follow the decision by New 
Zealand Health Ministry to make Sars this country's latest notifiable 
disease. Early Tuesday the World Health Organization said 58 deaths 
had been recorded worldwide from the disease. Enditem

China's mainland and Hong Kong, with a combined contribution of 79.5 
percent to Malaysia's total exports. ASEAN (Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations) was Malaysia's largest export market in February, accounting 
for 26.6 percent of Malaysia's total exports in that month with a 
value of 6.9 billion ringgit as compared with 8.1 billion in January. 
Exports to the United States declined by 22.1 percent to 3.9 billion 
ringgit in February, mainly due to lower exports of E&amp;E products, 
textiles and clothing, wood products and chemicals and chemical products. 
Exports to the European Union stood at 3.2 billion ringgit with the 
Netherlands accounting for the bulk of it with 894 million worth of 
exports. At the same time, total imports in February declined by 13.1

month with major sources of imports from the 10-member ASEAN (5 billion), 
Japan (4 billion), the United States (3.2 billion), China (1.4 billion), 
South Korea (970.8 million), Germany (969.6 million) and China's Taiwan 
(912.4 million). There were some declines in imports by end use for 
the three main categories, including intermediate goods to 15.3 billion 
ringgit (a decline of 11.9 percent), capital goods to 2.9 billion 
(a decline of 11.2 percent) and consumption goods to 1.2 billion (

Indonesia's state-run telecommunication company PT Telkom recorded 
a net profit of 8.35 trillion rupiah (some 927.78 million US dollars) 
in 2002 or was nearly double as compared with 4.25 trillion in the 
previous year, the daily Kompas reported on Tuesday. Telkom President 
Kristiono said the rise was spurred by the sale of 12.72 percent stake 
in its subsidiary, cellular phone operator Telkomsel, to Singapore 
Telecom (SingTel). The sale and purchase agreement on Telkomsel valued 
at 3.2 trillion (355.56 million dollars) last year. Over the period, 
Telkom's total income rose by 32.66 percent to 21.4 trillion rupiah 
(2.38 billion dollars) against 16.13 trillion rupiah. Enditem

Vietnam will apply the special consumption tax on motorbikes, according 
to a proposal to the National Assembly by Finance Minister Nguyen 
Sinh Hung. A tax rate of 50 percent will be applied on luxury motorbikes 
and 20 percent on popular motorbikes, Vietnam News Agency quoted Hung 
as saying on Tuesday. The inclusion of motorbikes in the list of commodities 
subject to the tax was due to Vietnam's pledge to ASEAN Free Trade 
Area's (AFTA) tariff reduction roadmap and the government's plan to 
keep the national number of motorbikes to around 13 million in the 
coming years, Hung said. Vietnam now has 12 million motorbikes. Enditem

Malaysian Transport Minister, Ling Liong Sik said Tuesday that there 
had been a three percent drop on a daily average basis in passengers 
arrivals at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) between 
the period of seven days before and after the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) was detected in the region. He did not provide a complete 
figure. He said the government had addressed this matter by taking 
preventive actions including informing the people of the symptoms 
of the disease. Ling said that the authorities at both the borders 
of Thailand and Singapore were cooperating with the Health Ministry 
to cope with the SARS virus. He was speaking at a press conference 
after greeting Nepal's assistant minister for culture, tourism and 
civil aviation, Ravi Bhakti Shresta, and the Royal Nepal Airlines 
managing director, Mohan Prasad Khanal, at KLIA Tuesday morning. Royal 
Nepal Airlines, the national carrier of Nepal, flew into KLIA for 
the first time Tuesday plying Kathmandu -- Singapore -- KLIA -- Kathmandu 
route utilizing Boeing 757-200 aircraft with a capacity of 16 business 
class and 174 economy class seats. He said the Malaysian Airline System 
Bhd (MAS) had taken steps to reduce some routes especially to the 
effected areas. It has been reported last Sunday that SARS had caused 
the death of a third victim in Singapore. In its latest update on 
the SARS situation in Singapore, the ministry said 35 patients had 
recovered from it and were discharged from the hospital while 53 more 
were still in the hospital undergoing treatment. Health director-general 
Mohamad Taha Ariff on March 28 said that Malaysia was free of SARS 
but the public should exercise caution by getting immediate treatment 
if they were to experience any symptoms of the disease, Bernama news 
agency reported. Enditem

Thailand's overall economy continued to expand in February, but some 
key sectors began to grow at a slower pace, according to a report 
released by the Bank of Thailand(BOT) available Tuesday. Atchana Waiquamdee, 
senior director of the BOT's Domestic Economic Policy Department was 
quoted as saying that Thailand's private investment still grew 17.5 
percent from that of the same month the previous year. Thailand was 
not eyed as an investment hub by leading economies such as the United 
States, some European countries and Japan where investors began to 
pay more attention to business merger than new investment, she noted. 
Thailand's export, however, expanded significantly with 24.7 percent 
in February compared with 25 percent in January as the country's import 
grew 22.5 percent. The industrial output index in February increased 
12.8 percent from that of the same month the year before, but declined 
slightly from the previous month's since orders for luxuries goods 
such as precious stones and ornaments had dropped. The inflation rate 
in February stood at 1.9 percent, down from 2.2 percent in January, 
while the unemployment rate reduced to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent. 
The BOT official added that the country's tourism had been affected 
by the US-led war against Iraq and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome in southeastern Asia. Enditem

Thirteen Vietnamese were charged Tuesday with human and sex trafficking 
in Cambodia, three days after they were arrested in Svay Pak, 11 kilometers 
north of the capital Phnom Penh. Khut Sopheang, vice-prosecutor of 
Phnom Penh municipal court, said they will be imprisoned for 10 to 
20 years if the court finds them guilty. The 13 Vietnamese, seven 
female and six male, were arrested on Saturday after some police officers 
raided Svay Pak brothel, the biggest of its kind in Cambodia, and 
rescued 37 trafficking victims, aged five to 16. The arrest was considered 
to be one of the largest brothel raids in recent years. The Ministry 
of Interior closed down at least eight Svay Pak brothels and arrested 
13 brothel workers from Vietnam suspected of involvement in the international 
flesh trade. Local authorities at Svay Pak told reporters that the 
brothel had been operated secretly and in small scale after it had 
been completely closed for almost two years. Though prostitution is 
illegal in Cambodia, prostitution and child sex offenders are rampage 
due to the poverty and lack of law enforcement. Enditem

The Philippine Presidential Palace was still considering holding the 
Balikatan 03-1 joint military exercises in Sulu in the southern Philippines, 
the Presidential Spokesman said here Thursday. Last month, a storm 
of protests from the local residents forced the Philippine government 
to cancel the exercises when it was first proposed. The opposition 
was a result of some misunderstanding and miscommunication between 
the residents of Sulu and the promoters of the joint exercises, the 
Philippine Star daily on-line news Tuesday quoted Presidential Spokesman 
Ignacio Bunye as saying. Bunye expressed confidence that the Sulu 
people would favor the Balikatan 03-1 exercises in their province 
and allow the arrival of US troops once everything was put in the 
proper light. Likewise, he said, discussions between US General Joseph 
Weber and officials of the Philippine Armed Forces Southern Command 
on the exercises were still on-going. Local government officials and 
members of non-government organizations also participated in the discussions. 
Americans also expected to hold the Balikatan 03-1 exercises in Sulu, 
which was one of the alleged bases of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf.

Chinese Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan met here Tuesday with a Belarusian 
delegation headed by Gurulev Sergey, chief of general staff of the 
Belarusian armed forces. Cao, also vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission and a state councilor, said the friendly exchanges and 
cooperation between China and Belarus in recent years were fruitful 
in the political, economic, scientific and cultural fields. The two 
sides also supported and closely cooperated with each other in international 
affairs, he said, stressing that keeping the long-term stable and 
friendly cooperative relations was in the fundamental interests of 
the two peoples and conducive to the peace and stability of the world. 
The military relations between China and Belarus was an important 
part of the relations between the two countries, he said. With the 
joint efforts of the two sides, the military relations enjoyed new 
progress in new historical conditions with frequent high-level exchanges 
and good momentum in cooperation in various areas, he added. On the 
Iraq issue, Cao pointed out that the war launched by the United States 
and Britain was unauthorized by the United Nations. China has appealed 
to the related countries to stop the war as soon as possible and return 
to the right path of politically solving the Iraq issue, he said. 
China would continue to provide humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people, 
he said. The Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly supported the 
Chinese government's stance on the Iraq issue, he said. Gurulev said 
the peoples and armed forces of the two countries had a profound friendship, 
and cooperation between the two armed forces was effective. He said 
Belarus firmly pursued the one-China policy and supported the great 
cause of reunification of China. He expressed his hope that the military 
relations, as an important component of the relations between the 
two countries, would be strengthened in the new era. Enditem

Japan will continue to fulfill its loans and other economic obligations 
to Malaysia, Japanese Ambassador to Malaysia Masaki Konishi said here 
Tuesday. "We will also continue with our economic cooperation in Malaysia 
and expect to maintain an upward trend in our investment in Malaysia 
in the long term," Konishi was quoted as saying by the national news 
agency Bernama after a presentation ceremony here for 33 Malaysian 
students who have been awarded Japanese government scholarships. Konishi 
said Japan might be facing an economic downturn currently, but it 
will continue to look at increasing its investment in Malaysia in 
the future. In 2002, Japan was Malaysia's third largest trading partner 
and its investments in Malaysia amounted to RM570 million in 109 approved 
projects. In terms of capital investment, Japan ranked the second 
largest investor in Malaysia after the United States in the year 2001. 
Investments were mainly in electrical and electronics products, transport 
equipment, basic metal products, chemicals and chemical products, 
rubber products, petroleum products and fabricated metal products. 
Last week, the Bank of Japan downgraded its assessment of the Japanese 
economy, citing the weak outlook for the US economy. It was reported 
that an export slowdown was threatening to derail recovery in the 
world's second largest economy, mainly due to a decline in US consumer 
demand for Japanese products such as cars and electronic goods. Enditem

French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin Tuesday warned against 
displays of anti-Americanism in protests against the Iraq war. "It 
is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, 
which would be unacceptable," Raffarin said while addressing the parliament. 
The French government was also worried that the frequent protests 
against the ongoing Iraq war would become a forum for anti-Semitism, 
the prime minister said. The government would not tolerate any signs 
of "racist, anti- Semitic or xenophobic acts," he added. France had 
been struggling to smooth relations with the United States due to 
its firm opposition to the US-led military campaign against Iraq. 
Raffarin said on Monday that despite the opposition, France was not 
the US' enemy. Enditem

revenues or solid first- quarter earnings of some listed companies. 
The benchmark Taiwan Weighted Index closed up 16.39 points, or 0.4 
percent, at 4337.61, according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The turnover

British Home Secretary David Blunkett Tuesday admitted that the American 
and British troops were widely seen as "villains" in the Middle East 
because of their war against Iraq. "We know that for the moment we 
will be seen as the villains," Blunkett told the BBC in an interview. 
However, he hoped such an attitude could change once the war is over 
and Saddam Hussein is toppled. "Once this is over and there is a free 
Iraq, with a democratic state... the population as a whole will say 
that we want a free country, we want a state to live in where we can 
use our talents to the full," he said. In contrast, the latest poll 
showed that more than 75 percent of Britons said "No" when asked if 
the American and British forces would be greeted as liberators by 
the Iraqi people, while 89 percent thought the coalition would not 
quickly crumble Iraqi resistance. Blunkett's remarks came as the British 
Ministry of Defense reported a 26th British casualty in the war. A 
British bomb disposal expert was killed when clearing ordnance in 
southern Iraq on Monday, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. 
In another BBC interview on Tuesday, George Galloway, a lawmaker from 
the ruling Labor Party, branded British Prime Minister Tony Blair 
and US President George W. Bush as "wolves" for committing the "crime" 
of military action against Iraq, saying the war was illegal and urging 
the coalition troops to disobey orders. Enditem.

Israeli troops destroyed early Tuesday the house of the Palestinian 
who carried out the suicide bombing attack outside a cafe in Natanya 
on Sunday, wounding nearly 60, Palestinian witnesses said. They said 
that a large number of Israeli soldiers raided the village of Deir 
El Ghusoon near the West bank town of Tulkarem and blew up by dynamites 
the house of Mohamed Jamil Ghanem, the Palestinian who carried out 
the attack. Saraya Al Quds, or Jerusalem Brigade, an armed wing of 
the Islamic Jihad (Holy War), claimed responsibility for the suicide 
bombing outside the mid-town London Cafe in the coastal town of Netanya 
on Sunday. The group said in a leaflet that the attack in Netanya 
is "a gift" to the Iraqi people. It also said that it had sent a group 
of suicide bombers to Iraq to kill American and British soldiers. 
Meanwhile, Palestinian witnesses said that several Israeli army tanks 
and armor vehicles raided early Tuesday the Palestinian refugee camp 
of Al Ama'ari near Ramallah in the West Bank. They said that the Israeli 
army blew up with explosives a three- storey Palestinian-owned house 
belonging to a family of a Palestinian militant, who has been detained 
by Israel and accused of carrying out armed attacks on Israel. The 
residents said that several damages were caused to neighboring houses 
in the refugee camp, adding that the Israeli soldiers arrested at 
least 10 residents. The Israeli government decided on Monday to freeze 
its policy of mass destruction of Palestinian houses in the Gaza Strip, 
Israel Radio reported. The radio quoted high-ranking Israeli army 
officials as saying that the Israeli army decided to stop demolishing 
Palestinian-owned houses during military operations and put on hold 
its incursion into the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian National Authority 
(PNA) has said that at least 860 Palestinian houses have been either 
razed by Israeli army bulldozers and tanks, or blown up by dynamites 
in the Gaza Strip since the Intifada (uprising) against Israel began 
29 months ago. Israel claimed that the houses destroyed in the Gaza 
Strip either belonged to Palestinian militants who carried out attacks 
against Israel, or were used as shelters for the militants. Demolition 
of houses has long been a common form of penalty adopted by Israel 
to punish Palestinian militants who carry out suicide bombings or 
other attacks against Israel. Enditem

It would be hard to resume the stalled Middle East peace process while 
the war in Iraq is still going on, a Palestinian National Authority 
(PNA) official said Tuesday here. PNA Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat 
told the Ramallah-based Al Ayyam Daily that while war is still continuing, 
"the Palestinians don't see any practical step to move the US roadmap 
peace plan from being a written text into a political track." Despite 
the US official statements about presenting the roadmap peace plan 
within coming days, "it would be hard to implement the roadmap plan 
and bring the peace process back on track because of war in Iraq," 
he said. The war on Iraq "must stop as immediately as possible, in 
order to help the parties resume the peace process and implement the 
roadmap to achieve peace in the Middle East." Erekat was quoted by 
the Daily as saying. He refuted statements made by the US officials 
that ending settlement activities in the Palestinian territories has 
to be linked to progress in the peace process. "These statements are 
contradicting with the text of President George W. Bush's speech as 
well as the roadmap plan, both of which called for an immediate cessation 
of all settlement activities," said Erekat. The US National Security 
Advisor Condoleezza Rice told the 44th annual policy meeting of the 
American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday that the roadmap 
for setting up a Palestinian state by the end of 2005 is not negotiable 
and Israel must "play its part" to pave the way. Rice's comments followed 
the US Secretary of State Colin Powell's, who also said the roadmap 
is to be implemented and not negotiated. "While everyone keeps talking 
about the implementation of the roadmap plan, Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon keeps on implementing his settlement plans in the Palestinian 
territories," Erekat said. The implementation of the roadmap peace 
plan had been postponed six times by the US Administration, he said, 
adding that "what we are concerned about is the war in Iraq would 
continue for a longer time, and talking about the roadmap would just 
remain words and not deeds." Enditem

HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- DHL, Danzas and Deutsche Post announced 
here Tuesday the relaunch of its parcel, express and logistics business' 
visual identity under the new DHL brand. John Mullen, Chief Operation 
Officer for DHL in Asia Pacific, said the integration of DHL, Danzas 
and Deutsche Post Euro Express under a single brand will create the 
world's biggest single logistics company. The relaunch program kicked 
off Tuesday with the rebranding over 4,300 vehicles, some 900 building 
signages, aircraft, packaging uniforms and stationery throughout the 
Asia Pacific Region, with the new DHL logo on a yellow background. 
The roll-out expected to be completed by 2004. The Brussel-based DHL 
is the world's leading express and logistics company offering customers 
innovative and customized solutions from a single source. Deutsche 
Post World Net increased its sharesholding in DHL to 100 percent in 
2002. The announcement followed the earlier one made in late October 
on the global consolidation of DHL, Danzas and Euro Express into the 
new DHL through the STAR Integration Program. The integration is aimed 
at providing customers with one-stop access to the most comprehensive 
service range of logistics products and services, Mullen said. Klaus 
Zumwinkel, chairman of the Board of Management of Deutsche Post World 
Net, expressed the belief that "we see DHL as the Coca Cola brand 
of logistics, ranked amongst the best-known international brands in 
the logistics sector." Under the new DHL in Asia Pacific, DHL will 
consist of three divisions, DHL Express, DHL Danzas Air &amp; Ocean 
and DHL Solutions. DHL Express will be the express delivery business, 
the present business of DHL World Express, DHL Danzas Air &amp; Ocean 
represents the former business of Danzas International. DHL Solutions 
will combine the strengths of the solutions business of DHL and Danzas 
Solutions including contract logistics, warehousing and distribution. 
"The merger brings together DHL's market dominance in the region's 
express cargo business and customized logistics solutions, and Danzas' 
global number one position in air freight and number two in ocean 
freight, with expertise in the development of customized industry-specific 
logistics solutions, global project forwarding, customer management 
program," said Mullen. He said the DHL business in the Chinese mainland 
witnessed a growth of over 45 percent in 2002 and DHL's Asia Pacific 
promotion will focus on its development in the Chinese mainland this 
year. DHL's business in the Chinese mainland is to cover more cities 
and even small towns in the coming years. Enditem

India's exports grew by 16.76 percent at over 46 billion US dollars 
in the first 11 months of 2002-03, but trade deficit widened by near 
14 percent to 7.8 billion dollars. The exports increased to 46,070.50 
million dollars during April- February 2002-03 from 39,456.36 million 
dollars in the previous year, according to figures released by Commerce 
Ministry Tuesday. Imports, however, rose by 16.31 percent to 53,865.65 
million dollars during the review period as against 46,312.96 million 
dollars in the first 11 months of 2001-02. As a result, trade deficit 
increased to 7,795.15 million dollars during the 11 months as compared 
to 6,856.60 million dollars in April-February 2001-02. Commerce Minister 
Arun Jaitley Monday exuded confidence that the country's merchandise 
exports would cross 50 billion US dollars in the financial year of 
2002-03 despite fears of prolonged war on Iraq. The government has 
envisaged an average 12 percent annual growth to achieve 80 billion 
dollar worth exports by 2007 to reach 1 percent share in the global 
merchandise trade from present level of 0.67 percent. Enditem

The car blast outside the British Embassy in Tehran Monday night was 
a traffic accident caused by slippery road and high speed, the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Tuesday. A pickup slammed 
into the wall near the main entrance to the British Embassy at around 
10:15 p.m. local time (1845GMT) Monday and burst into flames, killing 
the driver but injuring nobody among embassy staff. "The driver had 
lost control of the car on the slippery road because of rain, and 
unfortunately lost his life in the accident," Asefi was quoted as 
saying by the official IRNA news agency. The incident occurred three 
days after hundreds of anti-war protesters threw stones at the British 
Embassy and smashed some windows of its main building. The United 
States launched a war on Iraq on March 20 to topple Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein, who has been accused by US President George W. Bush 
of hiding and developing weapons of mass destruction, an allegation 
denied by Iraq. Enditem

British retailers suffered the first significant year-on-year fall 
in sales volumes for four years in March, according to the monthly 
report of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Tuesday. 
The organization said in its monthly Distributive Trade Survey conducted 
up to March 19, the day before the US-led war on Iraq began, that 
only 28 percent of firms said sales were up on March last year, while 
41 percent said they were down. The difference between firms reporting 
sales up and those reporting sales down was minus 13, this is the 
first significant fall since January 1999 which saw minus 9 and the 
lowest balance since July 1992 when a minus 15 was recorded. The CBI 
said this was the lowest balance since July 1992, when the British 
economy was just coming out of its last recession. British retailers 
had expected the figures for March to show an improvement on the February 
performance but their hopes were dashed for the sixth survey in a 
row. The CBI said the outlook remains downbeat with sales expected 
to remain unchanged in the year to April, the weakest expectations 
for eight years. The survey found that demand weakened across all 
retail sectors except hardware, china and DIY where significant sales 
growth were reported. Stocks have also run down to their lowest level 
in nearly two years as retailers cut their orders with suppliers for 
the third successive survey. Ian McCafferty, CBI chief economic adviser, 
said that "sales growth has stalled in almost every retail sector." 
"These results confirm our fears that consumer confidence has been 
affected by uncertainties surrounding the war in Iraq, the impending 
tax rises and worries about the housing market," he added. "Retailers 
have already done their best to prop up consumer confidence by cutting 
prices and heavy discounting. They will be hoping that the Budget 
does nothing further to keep people away from the shops," McCafferty 
said. Motor traders' sales fell sharply as sales of new cars declined. 
The Distributive Trades Survey covers more than 20,000 outlets of 
firms responsible for 40 percent of employment in retailing. Enditem

Eight out of 10 members of the public who had contacts with the Hong 
Kong Police are "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with its quality of 
service, according to a recent survey. The survey, conducted by the 
University of Hong Kong, includes interview with 843 members of the 
public, representing 1,228 contacts with the force through five main 
channels: the '999' consoles, reports made in person at police report 
rooms, by attending crime investigation offices, by being questioned 
at the scene of incidents and through telephone calls to police stations. 
Respondents, all over 18, were informants, crime victims or witnesses 
who had contacted police frontline officers in the three months before 
the survey -- between July and September 2002. The overall satisfaction 
rate with police services provided at points of police-public contact 
rose from 76 percent in 2000 to 80 percent in 2002, representing an 
increase of four percentage points. Amongst the five channels, the 
performance of the 999 console was rated the best and attained an 
overall satisfaction rating of 87 percent. Of particular encouragement 
is the overall very satisfied percentage increase from 8 percent in 
2000 to an astounding 20 percent in 2002, representing an increase 
of 12 percentage points. Another area recording a significant improvement 
is in the answering service provided at police stations where the 
satisfaction rate improved significantly, leaping from 70 percent 
in 2000 to 84 percent in 2002 -- an increase of 14 percentage points. 
Respondents were most satisfied with the politeness and helpfulness 
displayed by police officers and the efficiency of police services.

Britain acknowledged on Tuesday that efforts to win the support of 
Iraqi civilians for the United States-led war on Iraq could be undermined 
by civilian killings by US troops. Earlier reports said at least seven 
Iraqi women and children were killed in a van on Monday when US soldiers 
manning a checkpoint on a highway near the central Iraqi city of Najaf 
opened fire on the vehicle. "It does indeed, and if you were a civilian 
watching that you would interpret it in that way," British army spokesman 
Colonel Chris Vernon told the BBC radio, answering questions if the 
checkpoint killings would hurt attempts to win hearts and minds of 
the local population. However, he said: "If the decision is made that 
the threat against our soldiers is sufficient that they have to use 
self defense, then they will be fully supported." Vernon also admitted 
that local support for the US and British soldiers in Basra, Iraq's 
second city, had not emerged. Vernon's comments came after British 
Home Secretary David Blunkett said that Britain and the United States 
are currently viewed as "villains" by Iraqis and civilians across 
the Middle East because of the US-led war. "We know that for the moment 
we will be seen as the villains. We knew that from the reaction before 
the conflict started," Blunkett told the BBC Newsnight on late Monday 
from Washington. Enditem
