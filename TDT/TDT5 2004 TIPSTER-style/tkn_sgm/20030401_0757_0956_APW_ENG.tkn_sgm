SOUTH-CENTRAL IRAQ (AP) _ U.S. Marines waged a firefight against Iraqi 
forces Tuesday in and around the town of Diwaniyah and took at least 
20 prisoners, according to reports from the field. American warplanes 
also hammered defensive positions south of Baghdad overnight and dropped 
bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht and another ship in the southern 
port of Basra, Navy officials said. A Patriot missile battery destroyed 
a missile fired from south of Baghdad at U.S. forces in central Iraq, 
said Capt. Pat Costello of the 101st Airborne Division. A chemical 
alarm detector was set up to determine if any chemical weapons were 
used. U.S. forces were still trying to determine what kind of missile 
was fired. An Iraqi missile was also shot down by a Patriot missile 
battery before it reached Kuwait, the military said. Around Diwaniyah, 
120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Marines came 
under fire from artillery and mortars. Hundreds of Iraqi fighters 
with rocket-propelled grenades and rifles were said to be inside the 
town. Marine 155mm howitzers kilometers (miles) away opened fire on 
Iraqi mortar positions, tanks and bunkers. At least three Iraqis were 
wounded: Two very thin Iraqi soldiers who had been shot in the legs 
and were being treated with their hands bound behind their backs with 
silver duct tape; and an older man who had been shot in the back and 
leg. The Marines were guarding five men who had surrendered. There 
were no report of American casualties. Overnight, warplanes struck 
at Iraqi positions around Karbala and Hindiyah, about 80 kilometers 
(50 miles) short of Baghdad, in a U.S. effort to open the way for 
the invasion of Baghdad by American forces massing outside the city. 
The bombing was in support of the Army's V Corps and hit surface-to-air 
missile sites and a bridge across the Euphrates River, said Lt. j.g. 
Nicole Kratzer, a spokeswoman for the air wing of the aircraft carrier 
USS Kitty Hawk. In Baghdad, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf 
said Iraqi troops were repelling coalition forces, and claimed seven 
tanks had been destroyed around central Iraq. ``Iraqis are resisting 
the mercenaries of the occupation by all means,'' he said, ``through 
Fedayeen action, martyrdom, ambushes and direct confrontation by all 
means possible.''

After five weeks on sick leave, David Letterman returned to host CBS' 
``The Late Show'' acting happy, jazzed and just a little bit wacky. 
``I am still under the influence of high-powered pharmaceuticals,'' 
he explained Monday. ``If it turns out the show goes great, I've still 
got the guy's number.'' Letterman has been recuperating from a painful 
case of shingles, an infection of the nerve roots caused by the same 
virus that causes chickenpox. ``It hurt so much I was Michael Jackson-crazy,'' 
Dave raved. With that in mind, the evening's Top 10 List summed up 
all the good things about shingles. It was a list of just one statement 
declaring there is nothing good about shingles _ but expressing that 
sentiment in far more colorful terms. With a series of guest hosts 
subbing for him since Feb. 26, Letterman may have been out of sight, 
but he hasn't been out of touch. ``You know how they cured my shingles?'' 
he asked in a sly reference to the nation's current state of alert: 
``Duct tape!'' Then, with a proud smirk, he added, ``Thirty days it 
took me to get over the shingles _ and according to (Secretary of 
Defense) Donald Rumsfeld that's right on schedule.'' He welcomed as 
his first guest Billy Crystal, who with dread amusement recalled his 
own case of shingles. ``I couldn't put a sheet on me!'' said Crystal, 
who then took a close look at Letterman's eyes and chuckled, ``Hey, 
you're really waxed!'' For Letterman, who turns 56 on April 12, the 
evening was a loopier version of the joyous welcome he got in February 
2000, when he returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater after missing five 
weeks for heart bypass surgery. At the time he brought onstage his 
six doctors and two nurses from New York-Presbyterian Hospital and 
tearfully thanked them for saving his life. Monday night, pretending 
to get emotional, he introduced his dermatologist who diagnosed and 
treated his shingles. ``I'm back from my annual bypass!'' Dave told 
his fans.

Evidence found during a raid indicates that the Bosnian Serb army 
illegally spied on NATO troops and international officials in Bosnia, 
a NATO spokesman said Tuesday. An analysis of evidence found March 
7 during a raid of the Bosnian Serb military intelligence offices 
in Banja Luka indicated the military had been spying for at least 
all of last year, said Capt. Dale MacEachern. NATO peacekeepers seized 
documents indicating that the Bosnian Serb Army had ``collected and 
maintained intelligence'' on peacekeepers, European Union police and 
the office of Bosnia's top international official, Paddy Ashdown, 
MacEachern told reporters in Sarajevo. The spying also had targeted 
Bosnian state institutions and private citizens, he said, adding that 
it appeared the Bosnian Serb government had approved of the activities. 
``These actions equate to treating legally constituted organizations, 
charged with administering and keeping the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
as hostile organizations,'' MacEachern said. Branko Trkulja, a spokesman 
for the Bosnian Serb Defense Ministry, declined to comment, saying 
the ministry had not received official information about the alleged 
spying. The 1995 peace agreement that ended 3 1/2 years of fighting 
in Bosnia requires Bosnia's two armies to act in a transparent manner. 
They are obliged to help the peacekeepers, international officials 
and local authorities. The peace agreement divided Bosnia into two 
separate parts: the Bosnian Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation. 
Each part has its own army, but the two are linked by a joint parliament, 
presidency and government. The evidence of spying was handed to Ashdown, 
who as the top international official has the authority to impose 
laws and fire local officials as high as presidents if he considers 
them to be obstructing the peace agreement or Bosnia's development 
toward a modern democracy. Ashdown is expected to decide by the end 
of this week on what kind of measures to take, his office said Tuesday.

Riding a tidal wave of anti-American sentiment, outlawed Islamic extremist 
organizations, forced underground by the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan 
in 2001, are making a comeback. Recruitment in Pakistan of potential 
terrorists appears to be on the rise. Militant leaders freed from 
house arrest have returned to the mosques to rally the faithful against 
the United States. Muslim radicals are feeding on anger over the war 
in Iraq to regroup and revitalize, raising the threat of more anti-U.S. 
terrorism around the world. ``They are defiant. They are angry. More 
and more people are angry,'' said Abu Mujahed, a militant whose name 
is a nom de guerre. He said new recruits are being found by way of 
Internet chat rooms that deal with the war on Iraq and ``American 
aggression.'' Analysts say the Iraq war is emboldening militants, 
who believe the United States is distracted by the fighting. ``Militants 
know that the United States is fully engaged in Iraq and that has 
diluted their focus on the war on terror,'' said Riffat Hussein, a 
political analyst. ``The militants feel the government will not maintain 
as close a watch on them because the American pressure to keep down 
or stop all together the activities of militants is off.'' The war 
also is squeezing Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, a key U.S. 
ally in the war in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida 
network and the former Taliban regime. Musharraf's support for Washington 
must be balanced against two powerful forces at home. One is the army, 
dominated by religious conservatives who were reluctant about the 
U.S. war in Afghanistan and who now staunchly oppose the war in Iraq. 
The second are elements within the Pakistan intelligence agency still 
closely allied to Islamic militants. Old militant groups, outlawed 
as terrorist groups, have re-emerged under new guises and operate 
openly as ``political'' groups. Jaish-e-Mohammed is now Khudam-ul 
Islam, Harakat-ul Mujahedeen's new name is Jamiat-ul Ansar, and Lashkar-e-Tayyaba 
is now called Jamaat-e-Dawa. Other Muslim countries face a similar 
surge of support for violent movements: Egypt, Jordan, Yemen and Saudi 
Arabia, to name those most friendly toward the United States. In Egypt, 
the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which wants to transform the country 
into an Islamic state, is gaining exposure at anti-U.S. protests on 
a scale rarely seen in Cairo. Dia'a Rashwan, an expert on radical 
Islamic groups at Egypt's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic 
Studies, said he has noticed a trend as he navigated Web sites and 
chat rooms in recent days. ``Now we have many calls to jihad, and 
those calls aren't only coming from what we usually call radicals 
or extremists,'' he said. More moderate clerics are using such language, 
as are Islamic thinkers who usually confine themselves to political 
analysis, not calls to arms, he said. In Afghanistan, where U.S. troops 
are still pursuing Taliban and al-Qaida holdouts, the Taliban's supreme 
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is circulating posters of his fresh decree 
calling for a holy war against the United States. The signatures of 
600 Muslim clerics are attached. Mullah Omar's old regime has shored 
up its alliances with remnants of al-Qaida and fighters loyal to rebel 
commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Already, an increase is noticeable 
in attacks on U.S. forces, international peacekeepers and nongovernment 
organizations. There are only two camps left in the world today, says 
the decree from the one-eyed mullah who dominated Afghanistan for 
seven years: ``One is Islam, which is a religion of peace and the 
other symbol is Bush, who is a symbol of terror and hatred.''

A Russian navy squadron is set to depart for the Indian Ocean next 
week in the largest naval deployment since the Soviet times, a news 
agency reported. When the Russian navy ships reach the Indian Ocean, 
they plan to take part in joint maneuvers with the Indian navy, the 
Interfax-Military News Agency reported, quoting an unidentified official 
at the General Staff of the Russian armed forces. Participating in 
the voyage are the Black Sea Fleet's flagship missile cruiser Moskva, 
escort ships Pytlivy and Smetlivy, landing ship Cesar Kunikov and 
several supply ships. The Pacific Fleet is sending anti-submarine 
ships Marshal Shaposhnikov and Admiral Panteleyev and a tanker, the 
agency reported. It said the ships were scheduled to set out to sea 
from next Tuesday. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov has said 
repeatedly that the naval deployment was unrelated to Iraq. In an 
interview published Tuesday, he reaffirmed that the Russian navy ships 
weren't going to the Persian Gulf. The deployment ``isn't aggressive 
or directed against nations of the region,'' Ivanov told the daily 
Komsomolskaya Pravda. Ivanov said joint maneuvers with the Indian 
navy was a possibility, but didn't give any further details of the 
deployment. The Russian navy's presence in world oceans has been slightly 
reduced since the Soviet collapse. Most warships have languished berthside 
due to a lack of fuel and spares. ``The navy was staying dockside 
for many years, the seamen were losing their skills and people abroad 
stopped recognizing our ... flag,'' Ivanov said in the interview. 
``Why don't we correct this defect?'' (vi/mb)

Sweden and India on Tuesday agreed to better exploit the trade potential 
between the two countries, Swedish Trade Minister Leif Pagrotsky said. 
``We have an exciting and promising future ahead of us, both from 
an Indian and Swedish perspective,'' Pagrotsky told a business summit 
which included leading Swedish companies Volvo, ABB, Electrolux, and 
AstraZeneca. Pagrotsky said India plans big investments in infrastructure 
projects, such as power, roads and transportation, to achieve the 
ambitious growth target it has set for the coming years. That would 
offer great opportunities to companies in Sweden, which has traditionally 
been a strong base for heavy industry and equipment manufacturers, 
he said. ``I need to make more Swedish companies aware of what is 
happening in India. They need to see for themselves,'' he said. The 
Confederation Indian Industry and the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise 
_ the main business groupings in India and Sweden _ signed a memorandum 
of understanding to work closely to remove hurdles to improve trade 
and investment flow between the two countries. Two-way trade totaled 
US$560 million in the year ended March 2002. Sweden and India will 
also benefit from working closely on frontier technologies, Pagrotsky 
said. Swedish companies have invested about US$200 million in India 
to date.

Hungary has tightened regulations on the use of its air space in response 
to a breach of the rules by the United States in February, a government 
official said Tuesday. Gabor Brody, a deputy state secretary at the 
Foreign Ministry, told Parliament's defense committee that Hungary 
now required detailed information about flights seven days _ or a 
minimum of 48 hours in exceptional cases _ before any military flights 
can enter its air space. Previously, flight information was provided 
sometimes only hours before a plane entered Hungarian air space. ``Normally, 
use of air space between allies is based on the principle of trust,'' 
Brody told the committee. ``However, there are sometimes concerns 
regarding military overflights.'' On Feb. 20, U.S. military aircraft 
officially bound for Afghanistan _ with permission from the Hungarian 
government _ later landed in the Romanian port of Constanta as part 
of a U.S. effort to support Turkey ahead of the war in Iraq. At that 
time, the United States did not have permission to use Hungarian air 
space for flights related to the Iraq crisis. That permission has 
since been granted. A U.S. Embassy official later apologized for the 
misuse of Hungarian air space. (kpk/vg)

A jury was asked to decide Tuesday whether a British Army major used 
a coughing accomplice to scoop the top prize on game show ``Who Wants 
to be a Millionaire?'' Contestant Charles Ingram, alleged cougher 
Tecwen Whittock and Ingram's wife Diana are on trial for allegedly 
cheating the show. The prosecution says the three hatched a plan for 
Whittock to cough when the correct answers were read aloud. Ingram 
correctly answered the million pound (US$1.58 million) question, but 
the episode never aired and his check was withheld because of the 
cheating allegations. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin _ whose summing up was 
delayed by a day after several members of the jury succumbed to coughing 
fits on Monday _ said the choice before the jury was clear. Ingram 
left the recording studios after the taping on Sept. 10, 2001, as 
either a ``genuine millionaire or a fraudster,'' Rivlin said Tuesday. 
``Which was it?'' ``The prosecution say there can be no doubt about 
it. He and his wife and Tecwen Whittock were fraudsters and the evidence 
placed before you in this case is clear for all to see,'' Rivlin added. 
``They say here was a fraud, a scam if ever there was one.'' Whittock, 
53, a college teacher, Charles Ingram, 39, and Diana Ingram, 38, a 
nursery school teacher, all deny a charge of ``procuring the execution 
of a valuable security by deception.'' Rivlin noted that all three 
entered the witness box at London's Southwark Crown Court to ``strenuously 
deny any kind of dishonesty.'' The Ingrams claimed the win was genuine, 
he said, and Whittock insisted he had suffered a persistent cough 
for many years. ``They say it may possibly have been a remarkable 
performance but that it was a genuine performance, and, more particularly, 
as regard Charles Ingram, his basic case is he got the answers right 
because he knew them or was able to work them out,'' Rivlin said. 
The prosecution said that Ingram spent a long time answering questions 
and read aloud his options several times. Ingram told the court during 
the 18-day trial that his system was based on military training, ``weighing 
up the options and taking account of the risks.'' Both Ingrams had 
appeared on the show previously _ Diana Ingram won 32,000 pounds (US$50,900) 
and Charles Ingram failed to get past a qualifying round. ``Who Wants 
to Be a Millionaire?'' was created in Britain and became an instant 
evening television hit. Versions of the show have since spread to 
numerous countries, including the United States. (jw-rb)

The prosecution on Tuesday demanded a life sentence for the animal 
rights activist who confessed to murdering populist politician Pim 
Fortuyn shortly before elections last May. On the final day of the 
trial of 33-year-old Volkert van der Graaf, lead prosecutor Koos Plooy 
said the nature of the crime justified the harshest sentence possible 
in the Netherlands, which has no death penalty. ``No one must ever 
again get it into his head to follow this example, to frustrate the 
democratic process in this criminal and undemocratic way,'' Plooy 
said. Fortuyn, a colorful, well-spoken academic and columnist, was 
shot to death on May 6, 2002, in a parking lot after giving a radio 
interview in the town of Hilversum, 20 kilometers (13 miles) southeast 
of Amsterdam. He was contending for prime minister on a crime busting, 
anti-immigration platform and the murder thrust the country into political 
crisis. Van der Graaf's lawyers were expected to present a counterproposal 
for a lesser sentence, arguing that Van der Graaf has cooperated by 
confessing and deserves a chance to someday rejoin society. Judges 
will go into deliberations after Tuesday's session and render their 
decision in several weeks. Plooy said Van der Graaf deserved the maximum 
punishment because he had admitted to Fortuyn's premeditated murder 
and shown little remorse. ``The only fitting penalty is a lifelong 
prison sentence,'' he said to cheers from Fortuyn's supporters in 
the courtroom. During three days of hearings at a high security court 
in the Dutch capital, Van der Graaf said he had felt it his duty to 
kill Fortuyn, comparing his rise in popularity to Adolf Hitler. Van 
der Graaf said he still believes Fortuyn was a threat to Muslim immigrants 
and other ``vulnerable'' members of society. A psychological report 
presented in court said Van der Graaf is sane and can be held accountable 
for his crime, the first political killing in the Netherlands since 
World War II. Prosecutor Plooy pointed out inconsistencies in Van 
der Graaf's testimony, citing a note to his girlfriend in which he 
wrote: ``If I ever give a confession to the judges or media, then 
it doesn't necessarily have to be the truth.'' Before the assassination, 
Van der Graaf worked up to 80 hours a week litigating against commercial 
animal farming and was described by other activists as ``fanatic.'' 
He was to give a statement to judges later Tuesday. Van der Graaf 
has said he wouldn't commit the murder again if he could turn back 
time, but stopped short of apologizing to Fortuyn's family. He said 
he ``wrestles'' with the question of whether he acted justly. ``Every 
day I see it before me,'' he said Monday, ``I see myself shoot and 
Fortuyn fall.'' Several supporters wept silently in court Tuesday 
as Plooy described the ``cold and calculating'' manner in which Van 
der Graaf prepared and carried out the killing, walking casually past 
Fortuyn and shooting him five times from behind at close range. He 
attempted to escape by foot but was arrested minutes later with the 
murder weapon in his pocket, gunpowder on his hands, and traces of 
Fortuyn's DNA on his pants. (tcs/ad)

Mudslides triggered by flash floods in eastern Indonesia killed 27 
people, with at least five others reported missing, local officials 
and police said Tuesday. The floods swept away 17 houses on Flores 
island, 1,660 kilometers (1,030 miles) east of the capital of Jakarta, 
said Paulinus Domi, head of the local district of Ende. Police said 
they were searching for survivors late Tuesday in three villages hit 
by the flooding. The mudslides also damaged bridges, cut off phone 
lines to remote villages and forced authorities to close the local 
airport. Domi said the floods rushed through the area around 10 p.m. 
Monday night (1500 GMT), while most residents were sleeping. More 
than 1 1/2 meters (3 feet) deep, the fast-moving water rushed down 
from Meja Mountain and carried away everything in its path. The village 
of Ndunga _ made up of 150, poorly built houses _ had many of its 
homes damaged. In nearby Ende, flooding inundated hundreds of houses 
and authorities were preparing to move residents to higher ground. 
``The floods happened so fast,'' Domi said. ``It's a sad situation 
and people are scared there will be more floods and landslides. I 
can't imagine what might happen if we get more rain.'' Flooding and 
mudslides have killed more than 100 people on several Indonesian islands 
since the current rainy season began in late November. Many of the 
disasters have been blamed on deforestation caused by rampant illegal 
logging. Flores island has also seen its share of disasters over the 
years. Last week, five people were killed when an earthquake rocked 
the island. And in 1988, 17 were killed when their homes were destroyed 
in landslides.

France's prime minister told lawmakers Tuesday that displays of anti-Americanism 
were ``unacceptable,'' the latest in a string of statements from Paris 
aimed at smoothing troubled ties with the United States. The government 
should also be on guard for any signs of racism, anti-Semitism or 
xenophobia in the frequent protests against the war, Jean-Pierre Raffarin 
was quoted as saying by spokesman Jean-Francois Cope. France has made 
a string of comments in recent days to attempt to repair relations 
with the United States, which have been tense for months over Paris' 
high-profile opposition to military action in Iraq. Raffarin on Monday 
said that despite that opposition, France is not an enemy of the United 
States. Last week, the Foreign Ministry issued a special statement 
saying Paris hoped U.S.-led forces would win the war in Iraq. ``It 
is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, 
which would be unacceptable,'' Cope quoted Raffarin as telling representatives 
of Parliament at a meeting Tuesday at the prime minister's office. 
Though the government is insisting it wants to see the U.S. coalition 
win, the public appears to be much more ambivalent. A poll by Le Monde 
newspaper and TF1 television station published on Monday said that 
only 34 percent of respondents considered themselves ``on the side'' 
of the U.S.-led forces, while 25 percent said they supported Iraq. 
The telephone poll of 948 people conducted March 28 and 29 said that 
31 percent supported neither side. The survey did not provide a margin 
of error, but polls of that size usually have margins of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The French government has been 
on the defensive recently, clearly concerned that its strident anti-war 
stance is being seen by many on the other side of the Atlantic as 
a betrayal of Washington. ``France does not turn on its friends,'' 
declared Christian Poncelet, the president of the French Senate. ``They 
have taken a position that is not ours, but that in no way dents our 
good relations.'' Lawmaker Jacques Barrot, who leads President Jacques 
Chirac's Union for a Popular Movement in the National Assembly, said 
Paris' opposition to the war should not be read as support for Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein. ``We should not mistake who the enemy is,'' 
Barrot said. ``We cannot allow the glorification of Saddam Hussein.'' 
Portraits of the Iraqi leader are held aloft at anti-war marches in 
France, along with Iraqi flags. The government is also worried about 
the frequent protests against the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. 
Angry demonstrators attacked two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, 
and a human rights group posted monitors along an anti-war march route 
to guard against displays of anti-Semitism. The government ``will 
not tolerate any racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic acts,'' Cope quoted 
Raffarin as saying. (parf-jc-eg)

Luis Figo has regained his place in the Portugal team to face Macedonia 
on Wednesday, keeping out newcomer Deco whose dazzling performance 
and winning goal against Brazil sharpened competition for a place 
in the Portuguese midfield. Figo has recovered from a thigh injury 
which sidelined him in Saturday's 2-1 victory over the world champion, 
Portugal's Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said Tuesday. Portuguese 
officials denied reports of tension between Scolari and the former 
FIFA world player of the year over the coach's decision to call up 
Brazilian-born Deco. The 25-year-old FC Porto player recently took 
Portuguese nationality and came on in the second half against the 
world champion. Figo, 31, had expressed reservations about naturalized 
athletes playing for national teams, saying ``national anthems can 
be learned but not felt.'' The Real Madrid star was left off the roster 
for Saturday's encounter with Brazil and didn't even stay to watch 
the game. Deco, who came on the pitch in the 61st minute of the Brazil 
game, will start the friendly against Macedonia in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
on the subs' bench. Benfica winger Simao Sabrosa exits the starting 
lineup to make way for Figo in the only change to Saturday's team. 
That means Portugal will return to its customary attacking midfield 
lineup, with Figo alongside AC Milan's Rui Costa and Sergio Conceicao 
of Internazionale. Bordeaux player Pauleta, who netted the opening 
goal against Brazil, will again be the lone striker. Portugal automatically 
qualifies for the Euro 2004 championship as host nation. Scolari, 
who steered Brazil to its world title and took over Portugal at the 
start of the year, said he wants the team to keep up its winning momentum 
against Macedonia. ``When we take the first steps towards working 
well, we have to keep going,'' he said. 'We've got to stay focused, 
keep up the dynamism and motivation we showed against Brazil.'' The 
Portuguese are perennial underachievers, boasting some of Europe's 
top talent but failing to lift a trophy. Portugal was knocked out 
of last year's World Cup in the first round. Portugal lost its first 
game under Scolari, going down 1-0 against Italy, but the Brazilian 
said the team has since improved. ``We're improving by 10-15 percent 
each game,'' he said. ``I can see we're playing with greater enthusiasm...more 
commitment, more team spirit. ``If we can keep that rhythm up against 
Macedonia, it'll be another important step towards the 2004 championship.'' 
Portugal will adopt more attacking tactics against Macedonia than 
against Brazil, Scolari said, though he warned the Macedonia game 
would be no cakewalk. Macedonia lost Saturday to Slovakia and has 
taken just two points from its four Euro 2004 qualifying games so 
far. However, Scolari said he was present when Macedonia tied 2-2 
with England in October and was impressed by its fast strikers.

Iran insisted Tuesday that the crash of a fuel-loaded pickup truck 
into the walls of the British Embassy a day earlier was an accident 
and not a terrorist attack. ``The pickup truck smashed into the wall 
after the driver lost control due to high speed and slippery roads 
after a rainfall,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi was 
quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ``It 
was an accident.'' The truck, loaded with two large containers of 
gasoline and oil, crashed Monday into the perimeter wall of the British 
Embassy, exploding in flames and killing the driver. The director 
of security in Tehran's governor's office, Ali Ta'ala, identified 
the driver as a 35-year-old employee of the Energy Ministry. Police 
had called the crash an accident, but one eyewitness questioned how 
the pickup truck could have made it through openings in the metal 
barriers on either side of a bus lane that passes in front of the 
embassy wall. The embassy was the scene of a large anti-war demonstration 
Friday. Protesters threw stones that broke some windows and police 
fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. ^ (aad-sd-pfg) &lt;

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad overnight, 
including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces, Iraq's Olympic headquarters 
and what was believed to be an Air Force officers club. A steady series 
of explosions rumbled south of the capital Monday night and into Tuesday 
morning _ probably against Republican Guard positions _ after some 
of the strongest blasts in the capital since the war began March 20. 
Six explosions in rapid succession shook central Baghdad on Monday 
night, sending smoke billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound 
and bathing the sky in a soft orange glow. U.S. warplanes also dropped 
bombs on an Iraqi presidential yacht, U.S. Navy officials said Tuesday. 
Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said 56 people 
were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 24 dead in Baghdad. 
He said nine children, including an infant, were killed Tuesday morning 
in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the 
capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately killing people. 
Hillah is my hometown. It is a civilian place,'' he said. Across the 
Tigris River, a target was hit in the Baghdad center less than a mile 
(kilometer) from the Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists 
are staying. The 18-story hotel shook as if it had been struck by 
an earthquake. The target was believed to be a former Iraqi Air Force 
headquarters that was being used as a club for officers and their 
families, according to Iraqis familiar with the area. The building 
was reduced to a heap of gray rubble, a few pillars and an outside 
wall. A statue of Saddam just outside the building was intact. U.S. 
military officials said allied aircraft also bombed a complex that 
serves as the office of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where 
Saddam's son Odai is said to run a torture center. Human rights activists 
have accused him of jailing and brutalizing athletes. The lower four 
floors of the nine-story Olympic building were severely damaged. Walls 
were blown out, and mangled wire and steel protruded. The building 
sits in a big complex of housing units, and they appeared unscathed. 
Early Tuesday, American forces launched missiles toward Baghdad and 
the city of Karbala to the southwest. A huge explosion rocked the 
Old Palace compound shortly after 9 a.m. On Monday night, Saddam, 
Odai and Saddam's other son Qusai appeared on Iraqi television, with 
the station showing video footage of a meeting of top military commanders. 
There was no way of determining when the video was shot. A statement 
broadcast by Iraq TV also said Saddam's family members were in Iraq 
and had not fled. The statement accused the U.S. Department of Defense 
of starting false rumors. Saddam decorated commanders and troops of 
army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah for their 
``heroic'' defense of the areas, state television said. A communique 
read on Iraqi satellite television said members of the 11th Division, 
which fought in Nasiriyah, would receive medals and their families 
would get 2 million dinars _ about US$670. Saddam was last shown on 
Iraqi television on Saturday night. Odai had not been seen on Iraqi 
TV since the war began, according to Al-Arabiya television. The Americans 
had hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi 
propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the 
broadcasts. Iraqi television was off the air for about three hours 
Monday morning. But the local media operation was ``as good as it 
was before'' the attacks, al-Sahhaf declared. Nearly all the telephone 
lines appeared out in the capital city of 5 million after at least 
five telephone exchanges were bombed. But the city's power supply 
remained intact and street lights came on at night. Coalition bombardments 
have focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches 
to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces 
ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital.

Bravida ASA, which installs telecommunications and computer systems, 
said Tuesday it will eliminate 950 jobs, or 6.5 percent of its work 
force. Makers of telecom equipment have been hit hard as operators 
and providers cut back spending on their current networks and push 
back plans for new, faster networks in a bid to preserve cash. ``All 
the network operators we work with are downsizing and not investing,'' 
Bravida spokesman Sverre Auestad said. He didn't disclose the customers. 
He said 700 jobs in Norway will be eliminated, along with 250 positions 
in Sweden. Another 450 Norwegian workers will be put on temporary 
leave. Before the new round of cuts, which take effect in May, Bravida 
employed 14,500 workers in Scandinavia, including 6,500 in Norway, 
6,300 in Sweden and 1,700 in Denmark. Last year, Bravida eliminated 
1,000 jobs because of weak market conditions. The Stockholm-based 
company was created after Telenor ASA of Norway spun it off in 2000.

The government on Tuesday denied a report by a Paris-based group that 
it was barring the leader of a banned Buddhist church from leaving 
Hanoi and trying to move him to another monastery in a remote province. 
Thich Huyen Quang, patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, 
has been under house arrest since 1992. Quang, 86, was sent to Hanoi 
last month to have a growth removed near his eye. Quang then sent 
a letter to the Communist Party and the government asking that his 
church be recognized and given religious freedoms, and that he and 
Thich Quang Do, the church's second in command, be released from custody, 
the Paris-based International Buddhist Information Bureau said in 
a statement. Do has been under house arrest since 2001. The group 
said Quang was later denied train tickets to Quang Ngai province, 
where his pagoda is located, and officials have been pressuring him 
to go instead to Nguyen Thieu Monastery in Binh Dinh province, about 
160 kilometers (99 miles) away from Quang Ngai. ``This is part of 
a long-running government campaign to transfer Thich Huyen Quang to 
this remote province and maintain him under effective house arrest, 
whilst claiming that he has been released,'' the International Buddhist 
Information Bureau said. On Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman 
Phan Thuy Thanh denied the charges. ``This information is completely 
a sheer fabrication,'' Thanh said in a statement. ``Mr. Huyen Quang 
was practicing normally in Quang Phuoc pagoda in Nghia Hanh District 
of Quang Ngai province. He recently came to Hanoi for medical treatment. 
After the treatment, he remains in Hanoi to visit to the city,'' she 
said. Thanh also rejected the allegations that Quang is being barred 
from leaving Hanoi and forced to go to another monastery. She denied 
that authorities received a letter from him. Thanh's comments came 
a day after the U.S. State Department released a report on human rights 
in Vietnam. Among other things, it criticized the communist country's 
restrictions on religious freedom. ``Some Buddhists, Hoa Hao and Protestants, 
in particular, faced harassment by authorities,'' the report said. 
``The government imposed some limits on freedom of movement of particular 
individuals whom it deemed threatening to its rule.'' Vietnam says 
its citizens enjoy religious freedom, but forbids independent organizations 
that might challenge its control. The communist government permits 
only seven religious organizations to operate. Quang's group refuses 
any leaders imposed by the government.

The government on Tuesday advised Belgians against traveling to Hong 
Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and southern China because of the spread 
of a mysterious and deadly flu-like disease. ``If the trip is not 
essential, it is better to postpone it,'' said Health Minister Jef 
Tavernier. Prince Philippe, the heir to the Belgian throne, postponed 
his trade mission to Vietnam until the fall because of the disease. 
Struggling to contain the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, Asian governments have invoked emergency measures, 
including quarantine camps for hundreds of Hong Kongers who had been 
held in isolation in their contaminated apartment building. In Belgium 
itself, authorities are investigating two suspected cases of SARS. 
A Belgian soldier is in hospital in Liege with similar symptoms and 
a man who returned from Bangkok two weeks ago has died in circumstances 
which may be linked to the disease. ^ rac-pa &lt;

Congolese groups on Tuesday endorsed a power-sharing agreement intended 
to end a 4 1/2-year civil war in their country, but the government 
and a key rebel group remained at odds over their representation in 
a new national army. Representatives of the Congolese government, 
rebel groups, political parties and civil society adopted by acclamation 
a transitional constitution, an agreement on sharing power in a transitional 
government and a partial deal on defense and security arrangements 
The deals, grouped under a document called The Final Act, are supposed 
to be formally signed by leaders of the groups Wednesday, mediators 
said. It was not clear whether Congolese President Joseph Kabila and 
Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of one of the two main rebel groups, would 
attend the signing in this South African resort, said Vital Kamerhe, 
a Congolese government spokesman. Kabila's government and Bemba's 
Congolese Liberation Movement, or MLC, have yet to accept a deal proposed 
by mediators under which they would meld their forces _ with those 
of other rebel groups _ into a new national army. Kabila is supposed 
to give the deal his presidential assent three days after the signing 
to make it legally binding under Congolese law. Under the power-sharing 
deal, Kabila would lead the transitional government, aided by four 
vice presidents _ one each from the present government, the two main 
rebel groups and the unarmed political opposition. The transitional 
government is supposed to govern for up to 2 1/2 years, after which 
Africa's third largest country would hold its first democratic elections 
since independence from Belgium in 1960. Mediators welcomed Tuesday's 
endorsement but admitted the most difficult challenges lie ahead. 
``Implementation is the most painful aspect of the deals because people 
will have to make concessions on the ground instead of on the paper,'' 
said George Ola-Davies, spokesman for the chief mediator, former Botswana 
President Ketumile Masire. ``It was easier for them to reach agreements 
in South Africa, but it would be much tougher for them to come together 
at home and make it work.'' But government spokesman Kamerhe was optimistic 
that the deal would be implemented. ``Now we have a new constitution 
and a plan to work together with rebels, the political opposition 
and civil society in a new government,'' he said. The war in Congo 
broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to back 
Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila, Joseph's 
father. They accused him of backing insurgents threatening regional 
security. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to back Kabila, 
splitting the country into rebel-and government-held areas. Most foreign 
troops withdrew after a series of peace deals took hold. But last 
week Rwanda renewed accusations that Kabila's government is violating 
their bi-lateral July 30 peace deal by continuing to arm Rwandan Hutu 
rebels who fled to Congo after carrying out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda 
in which more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderates 
from the Hutu majority were killed. Key rebel groups also accuse the 
Congolese government of preparing for war by deploying troops and 
military hardware in eastern Congo, contrary to the original 1999 
cease-fire, which also envisaged the power-sharing deal. On Tuesday, 
the German branch of the Roman Catholic charity, Caritas, quoted the 
agency's secretary general in Congo, Abbe Jean Mwela Kibikie, as saying 
that troops from neighboring Rwanda and Burundi that had pulled out 
of eastern Congo last year had returned ``in large numbers.'' Amos 
Namanga Ngongi, head of the U.N. mission in Congo, dismissed the report. 
``I have military observers out there, and they have not told me anything 
about that,'' Ngongi said. ``As far as we know, there are remnants 
of Burundian troops, but we have not seen any Rwandans.''

A farm worker charged in bombings at two university campuses in Beijing 
went on trial Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Huang 
Minxiang, 26, was tried at Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, 
which said a verdict would be issued in the next few days, Xinhua 
said. It did not provide any other details on the trial. Huang was 
arrested while surfing online in an Internet cafe in his hometown 
of Fuzhou in southeastern Fujian province last month and flown back 
to Beijing. Police say he confessed to planting the bombs Feb. 25 
at the elite Peking and Tsinghua universities to achieve fame. Nine 
people were injured when the bombs detonated 90 minutes apart. The 
damage was estimated at 220,000 yuan (US$26,600), Xinhua said.

A court here has ruled that the estate of Giorgio Bassani, whose acclaimed 
novel ``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis'' was the basis for an Oscar-winning 
film, should go to the author's children and not to his American-born, 
longtime companion. The ruling came after years of legal battles between 
Bassani's family and the companion, Portia Prebys, a professor of 
comparative literature. In a telephone interview Monday, Prebys confirmed 
news reports that the court Thursday had ruled against her and said 
she would wait till she could study the ruling before deciding on 
a possible appeal. Bassani, who was suffering from Parkinson's and 
Alzheimer's disease, died in 2000 at age 84. The feud started years 
before the death when his children and wife, Valeria Sinigallia, began 
trying to have Bassani declared incompetent to manage his financial 
affairs. Bassani and Sinigallia were separated. A native of Bologna, 
Bassani lived much of his life in the nearby Renaissance town of Ferrara, 
whose centuries-old Jewish life was the wellspring for most of his 
literary works. ``The Garden of the Finzi-Continis,'' published in 
1962, tells the story of an aristocratic Jewish family whose beautiful 
estate serves as a romantic and illusory haven from the growing persecution 
of Italian Jews by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime. Widely translated, 
the novel was made into a movie by director Vittorio De Sica. The 
movie won the 1971 Academy Award for best foreign film. (ad/ic-fd)

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday welcomed foreign ministers 
of the Rio Group to the Kremlin, saying their visit should help bolster 
cooperation between Russia and Latin America. ``The Rio Group is one 
of the most representative and authoritative international organizations, 
and the most authoritative one in Latin America,'' Putin said at the 
start of talks with the Rio Group's troika, which is made up of the 
foreign ministers of Peru, Brazil and Costa Rica. He said that the 
troika's visit signaled ``the growing cooperation between Russia and 
Latin America.'' ``Our economic cooperation hasn't yet reached a high 
level, but we have been developing political dialogue and cooperation 
in confronting global challenges, such as terrorism,'' Putin said. 
``I strongly hope that your visit to Moscow will give a strong impulse 
to the development of cooperation with the entire Latin America.'' 
Peru's Foreign Minister Allan Wagner said that the 19-nation Rio Group 
was eager to develop closer ties with Russia. ``We highly assess your 
government's initiative in holding this meeting,'' Wagner said, adding 
that the first political consultations between Russia and the Rio 
Group offer a ``historic opportunity.'' The troika met later with 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who said the ministers discussed the 
war in Iraq and its effect on the ``world order.'' ``Both Russia and 
Latin American countries are for strengthening the role of the United 
Nations, multilateral mechanisms and principles of international law, 
on the basis of which controversies, including major international 
conflicts, should be solved,'' Ivanov told reporters after the meeting. 
Wagner said the ministers called for a speedy end to the war and a 
central role for the United Nations during and after the conflict. 
He said they also discussed ways to make the United Nations more effective. 
They also discussed Russia's relations with Latin American countries, 
including investment and scientific and technical cooperation, he 
said. (pvs/sk/jh)

Israeli cable television operators abruptly dropped the British Broadcasting 
Corporation's BBC World news channel from their roster of stations 
on Tuesday after the two sides failed to reach a financial agreement 
on continued service. Viewers awoke to find a written on-screen announcement 
where the BBC had been until midnight Monday, saying that beginning 
April 1, BBC World would no longer be broadcast. Cable company spokeswoman 
Aliza Khoury said the decision had been reached after negotiations 
between both sides, and was based on the British station's low viewer 
ratings and not on the BBC's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, which has been widely criticized in Israel as biased toward 
the Palestinians. She said Israeli cable viewers still had a choice 
of three international news broadcasters; CNN, Sky News and Fox News. 
BBC News will continue to be relayed by the Israeli satellite broadcaster 
``Yes'' and the cable companies are retaining BBC Prime, the British 
company's entertainment and general interest channel. About 1.1 million 
Israelis have cable TV, while the satellite company has about 310,000 
subscribers A BBC statement said the Israeli operators wanted a lower 
price for the BBC news service. ``As a commercially funded channel 
we were unable to accept the cable operators' proposal, which wasn't 
commercially viable,'' the statement said. Neither the BBC nor the 
Israeli cable operators revealed the amount of money involved. Israeli 
member of parliament Yitzhak Hertzog sent a letter to Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon _ who is also acting communications minister _ asking 
him to intervene to get BBC World restored and adding that the present 
fighting in Iraq made global news coverage more important than ever. 
``I wrote of the importance of this international news channel, which 
is seen in a million Israeli households, especially at this critical 
time,'' Hertzog said, adding that he asked if the communications ministry 
would make an effort equal to that it made when CNN was in a similar 
situation last year. Then, cable operators announced they were dropping 
the U.S. news channel, for financial reasons they said. That decision 
followed strident Israeli criticism of CNN for giving more airtime 
to the family of a Palestinian suicide bomber than to relatives of 
his victims, an Israeli woman and her 1-year-old granddaughter. CNN 
acknowledged it had erred and broadcast a series of heavily promoted 
half-hour specials on Israeli victims of Palestinian terror attacks. 
Under government pressure, CNN and the cable operators reopened negotiations 
and in October reached a compromise, details of which were not disclosed. 
An Israeli parliamentarian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the BBC case was not directly political but was affected by political 
factors, among which were the absence of a full-time communications 
minister and Sharon's preoccupation with other matters. Hertzog appealed 
to all parties involved in the latest dispute to show flexibility 
and seek to resolve the issue. ``I hope they can solve their differences,'' 
he said. ^ scw-pd

New Zealand slalom specialist Claudia Riegler announced her retirement 
on Tuesday, nine years after her debut in the alpine skiing World 
Cup. The 26-year-old Riegler, who competed for Austria up to the age 
of 17 before joining the team of her mother's homeland New Zealand, 
won four World Cup slalom races, the last one six years ago in Laax, 
Switzerland. Despite her wins, Riegler called her fourth place at 
the 1996 World Championship in Sierra Nevada, Spain, her career highlight. 
She later struggled to recapture her winning form after being repeatedly 
sidelined with a knee injury, but carved out her only podium finish 
in six years last December when she came third at Lenzerheide, Switzerland. 
``I don't know what I will do with all my free time now, but I feel 
healthy and ready for a new challenge again, `` Riegler told Austrian 
state TV channel ORF in an interview. She has lived in Salzburg. She 
said she would stay in New Zealand for a while, ``as I feel a real 
Kiwi and very much at home there.'' Riegler represented New Zealand 
at the Nagano and Salt Lake City Olympics in 1998 and 2002. In Utah 
she finished 11th in the women's slalom. In June, Riegler, who is 
dubbed ``Skiwi'' in New Zealand, wants to return to her ``second home'' 
where she volunteered as the patron of a charity race for a foundation 
supporting children suffering from cancer.

A veteran lawmaker from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's conservative 
party became the nation's new agriculture minister Tuesday after his 
predecessor resigned over a bribery scandal. Yoshiyuki Kamei, a seven-term 
lawmaker from the Liberal Democratic Party, was appointed minister 
of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a ceremony at Tokyo's Imperial 
Palace. ``I am fully aware of the heavy responsibility of this appointment,'' 
he told reporters. Kamei replaced Tadamori Oshima, who resigned Monday 
to take responsibility for allegations that an aide had accepted dubious 
political donations. Oshima was not personally implicated in the affair. 
But his resignation was another black mark for Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi, who swept to power in 2001 on a reformist platform that included 
promises to make his party more transparent and accountable to voters. 
Two Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers have been arrested in money-related 
scandals since last year. Kamei, 66, formerly served as transport 
minister under then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1996. He takes 
over the job at a time that Japan's farm policy is under fire from 
some of its trading partners. The Japanese government strongly opposes 
a proposal at the World Trade Organization to slash global tariffs 
on agricultural products, including Japanese rice imports. Farmers 
are among the most loyal supporters of Koizumi's party. Kamei said 
Japan will continue to work closely with the European Union and other 
importers of agricultural products to reach a ``realistic and balanced'' 
agreement. His comments came a day after the 145 WTO members failed 
to agree on a framework for cutting farm subsidies and import duties 
by a March 31 deadline. The Japanese government issued a statement 
criticizing exporting nations for making excessive demands and calling 
the missed deadline ``inevitable.''

Bo Lundgren, the leader of Sweden's conservative Moderate Party, said 
Tuesday he'll resign amid bickering about his leadership. Lundgren, 
55, was criticized by several members of his party _ privately and 
publicly _ after a worse-than-expected showing in September 2002 national 
elections. The Moderates garnered just 15.2 percent of the vote, down 
7.7 percent from the 1998 election, for 55 seats in the 349-member 
Riksdag, or parliament. Despite the drop, the Moderates remained the 
biggest opposition party to the governing Social Democrats, which 
hold 144 seats. The remaining 150 seats are split among five other 
parties. The Moderate Party is the only party in the Riksdag that 
has supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Lundgren said his decision 
to resign at the party's annual meeting Oct. 23 would let the party 
focus on campaigning for Sweden's adoption of the euro in a Sept. 
14 referendum. ``If we are to create conditions for a 'yes' to the 
euro we must avoid destructive personal discussions,'' Lundgren said 
at a press conference in Stockholm. Sweden, Britain and Denmark are 
the only members of the European Union that don't use the common currency. 
Lundgren wouldn't speculate on a successor, who will be elected during 
the party meeting. A former finance minister from 1991 to 1994, he 
took over leadership of the Moderate Party in 1999 from former Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt, but was criticized for lacking charisma. ``He 
has always appeared as technocrat,'' political analyst Arne Modig 
said. ``He has found it difficult to develop a personal, warm and 
human appeal.'' (kr-mpm)

Israeli cable television operators abruptly dropped the British Broadcasting 
Corporation's BBC World news channel from their roster of stations 
on Tuesday after the two sides failed to reach a financial agreement 
on continued service. Viewers awoke to find a written on-screen announcement 
where the BBC had been until midnight Monday, saying that beginning 
April 1, BBC World would no longer be broadcast. Cable company spokeswoman 
Aliza Khoury said the decision had been reached after negotiations 
between both sides, and was based on the British station's low viewer 
ratings and not on the BBC's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, which has been widely criticized in Israel as biased toward 
the Palestinians. She said Israeli cable viewers still had a choice 
of three international news broadcasters; CNN, Sky News and Fox News. 
BBC News will continue to be relayed by the Israeli satellite broadcaster 
``Yes'' and the cable companies are retaining BBC Prime, the British 
company's entertainment and general interest channel. About 1.1 million 
Israelis have cable TV, while the satellite company has about 310,000 
subscribers A BBC statement said the Israeli operators wanted a lower 
price for the BBC news service. ``As a commercially funded channel 
we were unable to accept the cable operators' proposal, which wasn't 
commercially viable,'' the statement said. Neither the BBC nor the 
Israeli cable operators revealed the amount of money involved. Israeli 
member of parliament Yitzhak Herzog sent a letter to Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon _ who is also acting communications minister _ asking 
him to intervene to get BBC World restored and adding that the present 
fighting in Iraq made global news coverage more important than ever. 
``I wrote of the importance of this international news channel, which 
is seen in a million Israeli households, especially at this critical 
time,'' Herzog said, adding that he asked if the communications ministry 
would make an effort equal to that it made when CNN was in a similar 
situation last year. Then, cable operators announced they were dropping 
the U.S. news channel, for financial reasons they said. That decision 
followed strident Israeli criticism of CNN for giving more airtime 
to the family of a Palestinian suicide bomber than to relatives of 
his victims, an Israeli woman and her 1-year-old granddaughter. CNN 
acknowledged it had erred and broadcast a series of heavily promoted 
half-hour specials on Israeli victims of Palestinian terror attacks. 
Under government pressure, CNN and the cable operators reopened negotiations 
and in October reached a compromise, details of which were not disclosed. 
An Israeli parliamentarian, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the BBC case was not directly political but was affected by political 
factors, among which were the absence of a full-time communications 
minister and Sharon's preoccupation with other matters. Herzog appealed 
to all parties involved in the latest dispute to show flexibility 
and seek to resolve the issue. ``I hope they can solve their differences,'' 
he said. ^ scw-pd

The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein should make the sacrifice of stepping down to end the war. 
Saddam ``himself has asked the people of Iraq to sacrifice for their 
country,'' Prince Saud told reporters. ``He should listen to his own 
advice,'' Saud said, saying that Saddam's continued hold on power 
was ``the only reason for the continuation of the struggle.'' Saud 
said he was not calling on or urging Saddam to step down. But asked 
whether it was too late for such a move from the Iraqi leader, who 
has pledged never to resign, said: ``Why should it be too late?'' 
In a joint interview before the war started with the Saudi-owned Asharq 
al-Awsat daily newspaper and Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal satellite television, 
Saud was quoted as saying that the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved 
had Saddam accepted a proposal by the United Arab Emirates urging 
him to step down and go into exile. The prince's remarks then were 
the closest Saudi Arabia had come to endorsing the idea. Monday, in 
an interview broadcast on ABC-TV, Prince Saud said he thought there 
should be ``a cease fire that allows for diplomacy to work'' and that 
he feels ``frustration'' with what he described as advisers to U.S. 
President George W. Bush who have pushed for the war with Iraq. He 
did not name the advisers. ``The president has shown that he was always, 
always patient,'' Saud said. ``But ... these prognosticators, when 
the United States needs friends everywhere, have gone so far as to 
try to convince the American public that their friends are enemies.This 
is a time for reckoning. This is a time to show who the real friend 
and who the real enemy is.'' Saudi Arabia, fearful of an internal, 
Muslim extremist backlash, has been quiet about its support for the 
U.S. military strikes on Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, the use of Saudi 
territory by U.S. troops as a launch pad against Iraq produced a cause 
for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to rally militants. ^ da/db &lt;

Archaeologists have uncovered a broken pillar with a carving of a 
lotus flower at the site of a destroyed 16th century mosque claimed 
by both Hindus and Muslims, a government official said Tuesday. The 
underground discovery could bring them closer to solving the mystery 
of whether a mosque or temple first existed at the site, a government 
official said Tuesday. ``The finding of a pillar and a multilayered 
flooring suggests there exists a permanent structure beneath the soil,'' 
said R.M. Srivastava, the senior government administrator in the northern 
town of Ayodhya, where the site is located. ``At this point we can 
only say that remains of a permanent structure lay buried in the soil. 
It could be anything _ a temple, a mosque or even a kitchen structure,'' 
Srivastava told The Associated Press by telephone. The broken pillar 
has a lotus embedded on top, he said. The Babri Mosque was demolished 
by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, provoking nationwide riots that killed 
more than 2,000 people. Both Hindus and Muslims claim ownership of 
the religious site in Ayodhya, nearly 550 kilometers (345 miles) east 
of New Delhi. Hindus claim it was the birthplace of their chief God, 
Rama, and they want to build a temple on the site in his honor. Hindu 
hard-liners also say that a Mogul emperor had built the mosque after 
demolishing a Hindu temple, a claim for which the Muslims say there 
is no proof. The Allahabad High Court in Lucknow, the capital of northern 
Uttar Pradesh state, is sorting through evidence in the dispute. Earlier 
this month, the court asked government archaeologists to excavate 
and report within a month whether ruins of an ancient Hindu structure 
lie beneath the site of the demolished mosque. India's Supreme Court 
on Monday rejected a government plea to lift a ban on Hindu religious 
activity near the site of the Babri Mosque. The court said the government 
must wait for the Allahabad High Court to rule on whether Hindus or 
Muslims have a right to the land in Ayodhya. In New Delhi, scores 
of hardline World Hindu Council supporters protested the Supreme Court 
order, saying it would further widen the divide between Hindus and 
Muslims, the Press Trust of India news agency said. The judgment is 
``surprising,'' PTI quoted Giriraj Kishore, a top Hindu Council leader, 
as saying. ``Should Hindus be always forced to suffer for the sake 
of harmony?'' Some Council leaders were arrested on charges of disrupting 
public peace, but were freed after a few hours. The leaders threatened 
to intensify their weeklong agitation and vowed to campaign against 
anti-Hindu politicians in next year's national elections. Hindu nationalist 
leaders argue that the government has made many concessions to the 
minority Muslims, while neglecting Hindus who form 85 percent of India's 
population of more than a billion. Muslims form 12 percent of the 
population.

The German government advised Tuesday against trips to a section of 
the Sahara Desert in Algeria after a third group of tourists went 
missing in the region. Six German tourists who were traveling by car 
in southern Algeria were reported missing at the weekend, bringing 
the total number of missing Europeans to 17. In an update on its Web 
site, the Foreign Ministry said travelers should avoid ``at all costs'' 
the area around Tamanrasset, where the group was last seen, as well 
as a route between the towns of Illizi and Hadjadj. ``Criminal bands 
and smugglers present an increased security risk,'' near Algeria's 
porous borders with Niger and Mali, it said, urging travelers to use 
experienced travel firms if they decide to go ahead. Authorities also 
have found no trace of two groups who disappeared in the Algerian 
Sahara in February. Helicopters and four-wheel-drive vehicles were 
used to search for the seven German motorcyclists and four Swiss travelers. 
Swiss authorities say their citizens last called relatives from Illizi 
on Feb. 20. (swg-gm)

DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ U.S. soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi 
women and children at a checkpoint in southern Iraq in an episode 
that threatened to unleash more resentment over war in Iraq. The U.S. 
military said the soldiers, increasingly anxious about the danger 
of suicide attacks, opened fire Monday when the driver of the van 
failed to stop as ordered. A Washington Post reporter at the scene 
said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including five young children. 
In the first moments after the shooting, a U.S. Army captain accused 
soldiers of not having fired warning shots quickly enough. The soldiers 
were from the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which lost four soldiers 
Saturday at another checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier posing as a taxi 
driver detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack. In a similar incident, 
another Iraqi was killed at a checkpoint near the south-central town 
of Shatra, according to U.S. Navy Capt. Frank Thorp. Elsewhere, the 
U.S. Central Command said, an Iraqi prisoner was shot to death after 
he reached for a marine's weapon while being questioned. The fatal 
shooting of the seven women and children happened along Route 9 near 
Najaf, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the site of Saturday's 
suicide bombing. The Qatar-based U.S. Central Command said initial 
reports indicated the soldiers followed the rules of engagement to 
protect themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist attacks by the 
Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid 
the unnecessary loss of life,'' the statement said. Thorp blamed the 
deaths on the Iraqi regime's guerrilla tactics and its practice of 
using women and children as shields. ``The most horrendous thing about 
this is that this is the result of what is apparently the strategy 
of the regime to challenge us at checkpoints, which has caused us 
to be on our toes and ensure that these are not suicide bombers,'' 
he said. ``So the blood of this incident is on the regime of Saddam 
Hussein.'' The shooting is likely to stoke opposition to the U.S.-led 
invasion among Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington 
had hoped for a popular uprising against Saddam and his Sunni Muslim 
regime. Instead, U.S. forces have faced stubborn resistance by Saddam's 
forces in Najaf and other southern Shiite strongholds. According to 
an account from the U.S. Central Command, the van approached the military 
checkpoint Monday afternoon. Soldiers motioned for the driver to stop 
but were ignored. They then fired warning shots but the vehicle kept 
moving toward the checkpoint. Troops then shot into its engine. As 
a last resort, the military said, soldiers fired into the passenger 
side of the car. Two other civilians were wounded, according to the 
U.S. military, which said it is investigating the incident. ``They 
tried to warn the vehicle to stop; it did not stop,'' U.S. Marine 
Gen. Peter Pace told the American channel PBS television. ``And it 
was unusual that that vehicle would be full of only women and that 
the driver was a woman. So we need to find out why it was that they 
were acting the way they did.'' The military statement said 13 women 
and children were in the van. But The Washington Post, whose reporter 
is with the 3rd Infantry, said 15 people were in the vehicle and 10 
were killed, including five children who appeared to be under 5. One 
of the wounded was a man not expected to live, the Post reported on 
its Web site. The newspaper described the vehicle as a four-wheel-drive 
Toyota crammed with the Iraqis' personal belongings. In its description 
of the shooting, the Post quoted a 3rd Infantry Division captain as 
saying the checkpoint crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough. 
The Post described the captain watching through binoculars and ordering 
the soldiers by radio to fire a warning shot first and then shoot 
a machine-gun round into the vehicle's radiator. When the vehicle 
kept coming, the captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About a dozen shots 
of 25mm cannon fire were heard from one or more of the platoon's Bradley 
fighting vehicles, the Post said. The captain then shouted over the 
radio at the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] killed a family 
because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' according to 
the Post. ``It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope 
I never see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a medic, told the 
Post. U.S. medics evacuated survivors of the shooting, according to 
the Post. A pregnant woman who suffered superficial head wounds was 
flown by helicopter to an American field hospital, the Post said. 
U.S. officials offered the victims an unspecified amount of money 
as compensation. The European Union head office called the killing 
``a horrible tragedy'' Tuesday, and urged forces on both sides of 
the war to spare civilian lives.

European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said global political 
tensions from the war in Iraq makes it all the more important for 
the World Trade Organization's current round of talks to be successfully 
completed on time. ``After all, there are not many areas in international 
governance which can bring good news in the coming months. WTO may 
be this area,'' Lamy said at a news conference in Thailand. Lamy urged 
completion of the so-called Doha round of WTO talks by the end of 
2004, even though several interim deadlines regarding the opening 
up of agricultural trade have been missed. He added that the EU was 
monitoring the risk of the Iraq war derailing WTO talks. However, 
when asked whether the tension between the EU and the United States 
over the war in Iraq would hurt global trade talks, Lamy said both 
sides have agreed to address their differences carefully so there 
is no spillover into trade issues. France and Germany have strongly 
opposed the war in Iraq while Britain has become America's staunchest 
ally. Lamy said WTO's multilateral system with its rules, discipline 
and enforcement mechanisms was now more necessary than ever. What 
the world's economy ``needs in the present circumstances is more of 
that rather than less of that, hence the sort of added impetus we 
believe it should give to the ongoing negotiations,'' Lamy said. He 
also dismissed comments made earlier Tuesday by Australian Trade Minister 
Mark Vaile. Vaile blamed the EU and Japan for the WTO's failure to 
meet a Monday deadline to agree to a broad framework for liberalizing 
agricultural trade, saying they were opposed to reform. Lamy said 
Vaile's comments were only part of usual tactics in complex negotiations 
``to scapegoat the partners.'' Lamy was in Thailand en route to Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia, where he will preside over the opening of a European 
Commission office. He was also expected to take part in talks with 
Southeast Asian economic ministers in Luang Prabang, Laos on April 
4.

The U.S. Steel Corp. announced Tuesday it had signed an agreement 
to buy Serbia's largest steel corporation, the state-owned Sartid 
Co., in a deal seen as a major boost for the country's crippled economy. 
John Goodish, a representative for the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, 
said his firm would pay US$23 million for the bankrupt Sartid steel 
mill, based in Smederevo, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast 
of Belgrade, and its six subsidiaries. The deal should be finalized 
by the end of September, Goodish said. Sartid, Serbia's largest steel 
mill, has capacity to produce 2.2 million metric tons of steel and 
120,000 metric tons of tin each year. Sartid declared bankruptcy last 
year, following economic reforms introduced by Serbian Prime Minister 
Zoran Djindjic, who was assassinated last month. U.S. Steel would 
invest US$150 million to improve Sartid's operating processes and 
US$5 million for environmental and community development projects, 
Goodish said. The deal does not include Sartid's debts, estimated 
at US$1.7 billion. The sale is considered a significant step in Serbia's 
economic recovery from more than 13 years of former President Slobodan 
Milosevic's ruinous rule, costly war efforts and international isolation. 
Milosevic now stands war crimes trial before the Netherlands-based 
U.N. tribunal. (av/sl)

Hong Kong pop star and actor Leslie Cheung leapt to his death from 
a five-star hotel here on Tuesday, local television stations and radio 
reported. Cheung, known locally as Cheung Kwok-wing, plunged to his 
death from a building in Hong Kong's Central District, radio RTHK 
reported on its Web site. Two Hong Kong television stations carried 
the same report. Police declined to provide a full identity but said 
a man surnamed Cheung, whose given name included ``wing,'' leapt from 
a hotel room in the Mandarin Oriental, a luxury property in Hong Kong's 
Central district. Cheung was certified dead at 7:06 p.m. (1106 GMT) 
after arriving at Queen Mary Hospital, police said. A suicide note 
was found on the body, police spokeswoman Catherine Chiu said. The 
46-year-old Cheung rose to fame as a singer in the 1980s with a bad-boy 
image and followed up with a distinguished film career. One of few 
Chinese stars to portray openly gay characters, Cheung starred in 
the Oscar-nominated ``Farewell My Concubine,'' in which he portrayed 
a homosexual Chinese opera singer who falls in love with a fellow 
performer. Cheung also played a Hong Kong man who moved to Argentina 
with his male lover in Wong Kar-wai's ``Happy Together.'' He also 
appeared in other Wong films, including ``Days of Being Wild'' and 
``Ashes of Time.'' Mandarin Oriental confirmed a body was found in 
front of the hotel early Tuesday evening but declined further comment. 
``The matter is currently in the hands of the police,'' general manager 
Peter Lowe told The Associated Press by phone.

Italian police have arrested four people _ one Egyptian, one Somali 
and two Iraqi Kurds _ who are suspected of having links with Islamic 
terrorist groups, anti-terrorism police said Tuesday. The arrests 
were ordered by Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who has been leading 
investigations into suspected Islamic cells in Italy. Bruno Megale 
of Milan's anti-terrorism police confirmed the arrests but refused 
to say where or when the arrests were made, saying the probe was in 
progress. The Italian news agency ANSA and other reports said that 
two were picked up in Milan and two in Parma, another northern Italian 
city. They were planning to leave the country, the reports said. The 
reports also said that at least seven other people were being investigated 
as part of the same probe. Italian dailies Corriere della Sera and 
La Repubblica, reporting on the arrests that were apparently carried 
out Monday evening, said the men were suspected of belonging to an 
extremist Islamic group based in northern Iraq and called Ansar al-Islam. 
Corriere said that before the arrests, the suspects' telephone conversations 
had been tapped for months. The suspects were charged with subversive 
association aimed at international terrorism, as well as with forging 
documents and aiding illegal immigration, RAI state TV said. Dambruoso 
could not be reached for comment. U.S. officials believe that Ansar 
al-Islam, a tiny Kurdish group, is linked to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's 
terror network. In a speech before the U.N. Security Council in February, 
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that bin Laden's man in 
Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, has set up a camp in a corner of northern 
Iraq controlled by Ansar al-Islam. Powell also said that Zarqawi and 
his network have plotted terrorist actions against several countries, 
including Italy. The arrests were the latest in a series of raids 
that have brought dozens of suspected terrorists behind bars in Italy. 
Many of those suspects were later released for lack of evidence. Late 
last month, Dambruoso asked an Italian judge to indict 61 Egyptian 
on charges of criminal association. The international terrorism charge 
was introduced in Italy only after the Sept. 11 attacks, and therefore 
could not be used against the defendants in the case, which dates 
back to 1995. Dambruoso alleges that the suspects have provided logistic 
support to two terrorist organizations based in Egypt, al-Jihad and 
al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. (ar-fd)

European Union officials will tell U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell 
Thursday they want the United Nations to take ``center stage'' in 
the rebuilding of postwar Iraq. EU spokeswoman Emma Udwin on Tuesday 
reiterated the European view that the United Nations has ``a unique 
capacity and experience'' to rebuild civil society in nations ravaged 
by war. On Thursday, EU officials will make that clear to Powell who 
will be in Brussels for talks with EU and NATO officials. Russian 
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will also meet Powell in Brussels, the 
government in Moscow said. For security reasons, Powell will also 
meet an EU delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou 
at NATO headquarters. Officials said the decision to not let Powell 
visit the EU head office _ only 3 kilometers (2 miles) away _ had 
``absolutely nothing'' to do with the recent discovery of listening 
devices in meeting rooms at the EU complex. ``We expect (Powell) to 
discuss the war in Iraq and ... whatever will happen postwar,'' Udwin 
said, adding EU was not ready to discuss specifics given that the 
war was still ongoing. ``This meeting comes too early for us to discuss 
detailed plans (but) it is important that we carry on discussions 
during the conflict,'' said Udwin. Given the souring of trans-Atlantic 
relations in recent months, she said it was ``encouraging'' Powell 
was prepared to come to Brussels. In Athens, Greek government spokesman 
Christos Protopapas said he wished Powell had come to the EU in the 
run-up to the war. ``Nevertheless, if he wants to talk on these issues, 
it is never too late,'' he added. The Iraq war has divided the 15 
EU nations and its 13, mostly East European, candidates. Germany and 
France lead a no-war camp while Britain, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and several East European candidate nations 
have sided with the United States. As holder of the EU presidency, 
Greece has been unable to abridge the rift, forcing it to focus on 
Iraq issues the EU nations agree on, such as Iraq's reconstruction 
and the U.N. role in that. French President Jacques Chirac emerged 
from a March 20-21 EU summit cautioning neither Britain nor the United 
States must have the lead role in post-war administration, saying 
it would only legitimize the war they started. The EU delegation that 
will meet with Powell will comprise Papandreou, EU External Relations 
Commissioner Chris Patten and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and 
security affairs chief. Patten said recently that unless the United 
Nations gets a lead role in rebuilding Iraq, it will be difficult 
for EU governments to provide significant reconstruction funding. 
Before Powell left for his trip to Turkey and Brussels, U.S. State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he would also discuss with 
the allies the makeup of a peacekeeping force. ``We have allies with 
different views. We will be talking about that,'' he said. ``The issue 
at this moment for us and the Europeans on the diplomatic track is 
to look at what is going on in Iraq, not in terms of the past, but 
in terms of what we can do to give the Iraqis a better future.'' ^

More than a decade ago, Diego Fernando Rincon's family escaped Colombia's 
violence by moving to the United States, where he joined the U.S. 
Army. Last Saturday, Pfc. Rincon, 19, became the first Colombian-born 
U.S. soldier to die in Iraq when a car bomb blew up at a military 
checkpoint. Three other American soldiers and the driver _ said to 
be an Iraqi noncommissioned army officer _ also died in the blast. 
Car bombings are commonly used by leftist rebels and drug traffickers 
in Colombia's civil war, which has dragged on for 38 years. But little 
did Rincon's family expect that he would fall victim to a car bomb 
in far-off Iraq. Luis Rincon, Rincon's uncle, said he had been proud 
to see the young man join the U.S. Army. Luis Rincon, the mayor of 
the Colombian town of Mosquera, told The Associated Press that he 
was looking forward to seeing his nephew, who planned to visit his 
homeland after the war in Iraq. ``He wanted to come to Colombia after 
the war to get to know the good parts of the country,'' Rincon, his 
voice choking with emotion, said in a telephone interview Monday night. 
Diego Fernando was born in the town of Mosquera, 15 kilometers (10 
miles) west of Bogota, the Colombian capital. His family immigrated 
to Conyers, Georgia, in 1989 and had not returned since. Relatives 
who stayed behind sent him homemade videotapes of his homeland, his 
uncle recalled. ``He was very nostalgic about things that had the 
colors of Colombia,'' his uncle said. ``We taped for him the streets 
of Funza, Mosquera, Bogota.'' In Conyers, a town east of Atlanta, 
yellow ribbons honoring the dead soldier adorned every mailbox in 
his neighborhood. His yellow Mustang was draped with American flags 
and other memorabilia. The young Rincon signed up for military service 
after he graduated from Salem High School in Conyers, reportedly telling 
friends and family that he wanted to avenge the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks 
and protect his adopted country. ``My son Diego was a very brave man, 
and we are all very proud of him,'' Rincon's father, George, told 
reporters outside his home.

A farm worker charged in bombings at two university campuses in Beijing 
went on trial Tuesday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Huang 
Minxiang, 26, was tried at Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court, 
which said a verdict would be issued in the next few days, Xinhua 
said. It did not provide any other details on the trial. The state 
evening news had a brief story on the trial, showing Huang on the 
dock facing three judges. Huang was arrested while surfing online 
in an Internet cafe in his hometown of Fuzhou in southeastern Fujian 
province last month and flown back to Beijing. Police say he confessed 
to planting the bombs Feb. 25 at the elite Peking and Tsinghua universities 
to achieve fame. Nine people were injured when the bombs detonated 
90 minutes apart. The damage was estimated at 220,000 yuan (US$26,600), 
Xinhua said.

Transport workers and teachers planned massive strikes for Thursday 
that risk crippling public transport in the French capital and hobbling 
air traffic. The strikes, called to defend France's retirement system 
for civil servants, are expected to lead to ``very strong disturbances'' 
in Paris' metro and bus systems, on suburban trains and other local 
transport, according to the state-run RATP, which runs public transport 
in Paris. Officials did not immediately predict what fallout the strike 
might have on air traffic. However, the walkout was called for by 
the union representing the majority of air traffic controllers and 
was bound to have an effect. As for teachers, the Education Ministry 
traditionally provides such data only on the day of the strike. The 
walkouts are aimed at pressing France's center-right government to 
keep retirement benefits for civil servants intact, nearly two months 
after Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin announced plans to reform 
the retirement system. The pension system needs a dramatic overall 
to avoid collapse within 20 years. The government is also planning 
to reform the system that governs France's huge force of civil servants, 
widely considered a privileged lot because of their special benefits.

Air Mauritius on Tuesday suspended its flights to Hong Kong for a 
month because of poor ticket sales following the outbreak of a flu-like 
virus in Asia, the airline's managing director said. Just 75 out of 
a possible 294 passengers were onboard the airline's last flight to 
Hong Kong, which was on Monday, said Vinod Chidambaram. Chidambaram 
said the airline will monitor the situation on a regular basis. The 
illness, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, has 
prompted officials in Asian countries to enforce little-used quarantine 
laws, close schools and impose new health screenings on travelers. 
More than 600 people in Hong Kong are believed to have the dangerous 
infection. Air Mauritius has two flights a week from this Indian Ocean 
island of 1.1 million people to Hong Kong. For the time being, it 
will continue its twice-weekly flights to Malaysia and Singapore, 
Chidambaram said. The government has advised Mauritians to not to 
travel to high risk areas unless absolutely necessary. ``Those who 
have to travel to or through high risk countries during the past two 
weeks have to report to the nearest hospital or contact a doctor should 
they show any symptoms of the disease,'' Health Minister Ashok Jugnauth 
told parliament on Tuesday.

The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein should make the sacrifice of stepping down if it would end 
the war. Saddam ``himself has asked the people of Iraq to sacrifice 
for their country,'' Prince Saud told reporters. ``He should listen 
to his own advice,'' Saud said, saying that if Saddam's continued 
hold on power was ``the only reason for the continuation of the struggle'' 
he should step down. Saud said he was not calling on or urging Saddam 
to step down. But asked whether it was too late for such a move from 
the Iraqi leader, who has pledged never to resign, said: ``Why should 
it be too late?'' In a joint interview before the war started with 
the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat daily newspaper and Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal 
satellite television, Saud was quoted as saying that the Iraqi crisis 
could have been resolved had Saddam accepted a proposal by the United 
Arab Emirates urging him to step down and go into exile. The prince's 
remarks then were the closest Saudi Arabia had come to endorsing the 
idea. Monday, in an interview broadcast on ABC-TV, Prince Saud said 
he thought there should be ``a cease fire that allows for diplomacy 
to work'' and that he feels ``frustration'' with what he described 
as advisers to U.S. President George W. Bush who have pushed for the 
war with Iraq. He did not name the advisers. ``The president has shown 
that he was always, always patient,'' Saud said. ``But ... these prognosticators, 
when the United States needs friends everywhere, have gone so far 
as to try to convince the American public that their friends are enemies.This 
is a time for reckoning. This is a time to show who the real friend 
and who the real enemy is.'' Saudi Arabia, fearful of an internal, 
Muslim extremist backlash, has been quiet about its support for the 
U.S. military strikes on Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, the use of Saudi 
territory by U.S. troops as a launch pad against Iraq produced a cause 
for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to rally militants. ^ da/db &lt;

With just 500 days left before the start of the Olympics, the chief 
organizer for the 2004 Games said Tuesday she was increasingly confident 
that Athens will overcome delays and be ready on time. ``We have a 
great deal yet to accomplish in a very short time. Despite the pressure, 
we are increasingly confident that our preparations will be completed 
on time,'' Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said. She added that Athens 
made headway on a number of fronts, including the signing of a long-delayed 
security contract. ``We have come a long way in a very short time,'' 
Angelopoulos-Daskalaki said. ``We have a clear plan of what must be 
accomplished in the 500 days that remain.'' ``All of this progress 
is testimony to the talent and energy of the Greek people, the hard 
work of the Greek public and private sector, and an unshakable commitment 
in every quarter to hosting an Olympic homecoming that will make both 
Greece and the Olympic Movement proud,'' she added. A series of pre-Olympic 
competitions is the next hurdle faced by organizers and Angelopoulos-Daskalaki 
said ``starting this August we proceed with the test events.'' Construction 
delays at some sports venues, however, may force organizers to reschedule 
a number of test events, competitions that allow officials to assess 
sites and allow time for corrections before the Olympics. ^ lo-pq

The U.N. health agency said Tuesday it is considering whether to advise 
travelers against going to Hong Kong and other Asian countries hit 
by a mysterious and deadly disease. The rare move follows information 
from Hong Kong authorities that they have been unable to find a link 
between new cases there and patients previously infected with Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which has so far killed at least 
58 people and sickened more than 1,600. ``It appears that there is 
now some environmental factor, such as water or sewage, which is taking 
this disease from one human to another,'' said Dr. David Heymann, 
infectious diseases chief at the World Health Organization. He said 
the concerns center around an apartment block in Hong Kong where a 
large number of cases have been reported. Some patients do not remember 
being in contact with any other patient, leading doctors to wonder 
if the disease is being spread through the building without close 
human contact. WHO still insists that the disease is not airborne 
but says it can be passed through small droplets of breath or by touching 
something recently touched by a patient. Heymann said the WHO is hopeful 
that authorities will link all the cases by early Wednesday. If not, 
it will decide whether to advise against travel. Until now, WHO has 
issued advice only to governments, with the aim of preventing the 
spread of the disease. It hasn't advised against travel, but has said 
airports should screen passengers and refuse to board those who have 
symptoms or who have been in contact with SARS patients. Now it is 
considering updating its advice to travelers to take account of SARS. 
Until now, that list mostly consists of advice on whether travelers 
need vaccinations or antimalarial tablets. But there is no vaccination 
available against SARS ``so the advice might be to avoid the area 
altogether,'' Heymann said. With cases already found in a number of 
European countries from air passengers who have been in the affected 
regions, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among European 
countries already have advised residents against traveling there unless 
their trip is absolutely essential. ^ (nk-agh) &lt;

Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Tuesday that rebuilding 
postwar Iraq is a task for the international community. Speaking at 
his weekly press conference, Fogh Rasmussen was confident that the 
U.N. Security Council would settle on a proposal to oversee Iraq's 
construction. ``It should be possible. All the countries have an interest 
in rebuilding Iraq,'' he said. ``We cannot just let the Iraqi people 
be left to themselves.'' Denmark, a Scandinavian country of 5.3 million, 
is part of the U.S.-led invasion against Iraq, having deployed a submarine 
and naval escort ship to the Persian Gulf. No matter how Iraq is rebuilt, 
he said reconstruction must cover more than the damage inflicted by 
the war, but also by ``12 years of U.N. sanctions,'' which were imposed 
after Iraq was ousted from Kuwait in 1991. Last week, Germany's development 
minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, said the United States and Britain 
should shoulder most of the cost of rebuilding Iraq after invading 
it without U.N. approval. Fogh Rasmussen, flanked by two plainclothes 
police, didn't say how long he thought the war would last. ``From 
the beginning, we knew that it was not an easy and simple operation,'' 
he said. Security at the press conference was increased after Fogh 
Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller were doused with red 
paint inside Copenhagen's parliament building March 18 by two anti-war 
activists. Besides the increased police presence, reporters were searched 
before allowed into the room. Fogh Rasmussen said the increased security 
was because of the paint incident, not any specific threat against 
him or the country. (jo-mpm)

ROME (AP) _ AC Milan's Brazilian midfielder Leonardo said Tuesday 
he is retiring from play but will remain with the club in an administrative 
role. The 33-year-old Leonardo made two appearances for the team this 
season after returning to play for the squad in October. ``My decision 
is definite,'' Leonardo told a news conference at the team's headquarters 
in Milan. ``I have chosen to stop my soccer career before the end 
of the season because I have so many things to look after apart from 
playing that it becomes impossible to combine training with all the 
other engagements.'' Club vice president Adriano Galliani said Leonardo 
would take over as his assistant and be in in charge of a charity 
organization set up by the team in February. Leonardo played for Milan 
from 1997 to 2001, helping them win the Italian league title in 1999. 
After playing a year in Brazil, he returned to AC Milan. Born in a 
Rio de Janeiro suburb, Leonardo Nascimento de Araujo began his playing 
career with Brazilian club Flamengo. He debuted for the national squad 
in 1989 and was a member of their 1994 World Cup winning team. He 
has also played in France, Spain and for the Japanese side Kashima 
Antlers. (ic-fd/vls)

The leader of Sweden's main opposition Moderate Party, Bo Lundgren, 
said Tuesday he will resign this October because of bickering about 
his leadership. Several party officials had publicly blamed Lundgren 
for the Moderates' unexpectedly weak performance in national elections 
last September. The conservative party garnered just 15.2 percent 
of the vote, down 7.7 percent from the 1998 election, to retain 55 
seats in the 349-member Riksdag, the parliament. Despite the drop, 
the Moderates remained the biggest opposition party to the governing 
Social Democrats, which have 144 seats. Five other parties hold the 
remaining 150 seats. The Moderates are the only Swedish party to support 
the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Lundgren, 55, said his resignation 
would take effect at the party's annual meeting Oct. 23. He said the 
decision _ which transforms himself immediately into a lame-duck leader 
_ should allow party activists to concentrate on the approaching challenge 
of Sweden's Sept. 14 referendum on whether to join Europe's common 
currency, the euro. Activists must concentrate on selling the merits 
of the euro, he said, not his own disputed skills as leader. ``If 
we are to create conditions for a `yes' to the euro, we must avoid 
destructive personal discussions,'' Lundgren said at a Stockholm press 
conference. Sweden, Britain and Denmark are the only European Union 
members that don't use the common currency. Lundgren wouldn't speculate 
on who party activists would most likely select as his successor Oct. 
23. Lundgren served as finance minister from 1991 to 1994. He succeeded 
former Prime Minister Carl Bildt as the Moderate leader in 1999. But 
analysts say Lundgren suffered from a charisma deficit. ``He has always 
appeared as a technocrat,'' political analyst Arne Modig said. ``He 
has found it difficult to develop a personal, warm and human appeal.''

The prosecution on Tuesday demanded a sentence of life imprisonment 
for the animal rights activist who confessed to murdering populist 
politician Pim Fortuyn shortly before elections last May. Presenting 
closing arguments in the trial of 33-year-old Volkert van der Graaf, 
lead prosecutor Koos Plooy said the nature of the crime justified 
the harshest sentence possible in the Netherlands, which has no death 
penalty. ``No one must ever again get it into his head to follow this 
example, to frustrate the democratic process in this criminal and 
undemocratic way,'' Plooy said. Fortuyn, a colorful, well-spoken academic 
and columnist, was shot to death on May 6, 2002, in a parking lot 
after giving a radio interview in the town of Hilversum, 20 kilometers 
(13 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. He was contending for prime minister 
on a crime busting, anti-immigration platform and the murder thrust 
the country into political crisis. Van der Graaf's lawyer, Britta 
Bohler, argued for a lesser sentence, saying her client had cooperated 
by confessing and deserved a chance to rejoin society. She said a 
sentence for the rest of his days was ``unthinkable.'' ``He did commit 
the crime, but not with a morally reprehensible intention,'' she said 
in final comments, drawing loud objections from the public gallery. 
``He did not view it (the murder) as an attack on democracy, but rather 
saw Fortuyn as a danger to democracy,'' Bohler said, recalling Fortuyn's 
desire to drop constitutional guarantees against discrimination. Judges 
will go into deliberations after Tuesday's session and render their 
decision in several weeks. Plooy said Van der Graaf deserved the maximum 
punishment because he had admitted to Fortuyn's premeditated murder 
and shown little remorse. ``The only fitting penalty is a lifelong 
prison sentence,'' he said to cheers from Fortuyn's supporters in 
the courtroom. During three days of hearings at a high security court 
in the Dutch capital, Van der Graaf said he had felt it his duty to 
kill Fortuyn, comparing his rise in popularity to Adolf Hitler. Van 
der Graaf said he still believes Fortuyn was a threat to Muslim immigrants 
and other ``vulnerable'' members of society. A psychological report 
presented in court said Van der Graaf is sane and can be held accountable 
for his crime, the first political killing in the Netherlands since 
World War II. Prosecutor Plooy pointed out inconsistencies in Van 
der Graaf's testimony, citing a note to his girlfriend in which he 
wrote: ``If I ever give a confession to the judges or media, then 
it doesn't necessarily have to be the truth.'' Before the assassination, 
Van der Graaf worked up to 80 hours a week litigating against commercial 
animal farming and was described by other activists as ``fanatic.'' 
He was to give a statement to judges later Tuesday. Plooy suggested 
Van der Graaf's true motive to kill Fortuyn had been Fortuyn's plans 
to lift a ban on legalize breeding of animals for fur, not a broader 
concern for the country's immigrants. Several supporters wept silently 
in court Tuesday as Plooy described the ``cold and calculating'' manner 
in which Van der Graaf prepared and carried out the killing, walking 
casually past Fortuyn and shooting him five times from behind at close 
range. He attempted to escape by foot but was arrested minutes later 
with the murder weapon in his pocket, gunpowder on his hands, and 
traces of Fortuyn's DNA on his pants. (tcs/ad)

Israeli cable television operators abruptly dropped the British Broadcasting 
Corporation's BBC World news channel from their roster of stations 
on Tuesday after the two sides failed to reach a financial agreement 
on continued service. Viewers awoke to find a written on-screen announcement 
where the BBC had been until midnight Monday, saying that beginning 
April 1, BBC World would no longer be broadcast. Cable company spokeswoman 
Aliza Khoury said the decision had been reached after negotiations 
between both sides, and was based on the British station's low viewer 
ratings and not on the BBC's reporting of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, which has been widely criticized in Israel as biased toward 
the Palestinians. She said Israeli cable viewers still had a choice 
of three international news broadcasters; CNN, Sky News and Fox News. 
BBC News will continue to be relayed by the Israeli satellite broadcaster 
``Yes'' and the cable companies are retaining BBC Prime, the British 
company's entertainment and general interest channel. About 1.1 million 
Israeli homes have cable TV, while the satellite company has about 
310,000 subscribers A BBC statement said the Israeli operators wanted 
a lower price for the BBC news service. ``As a commercially funded 
channel we were unable to accept the cable operators' proposal, which 
wasn't commercially viable,'' the statement said. Neither the BBC 
nor the Israeli cable operators revealed the amount of money involved. 
Israeli member of parliament Yitzhak Herzog sent a letter to Prime 
Minister Ariel Sharon _ who is also acting communications minister 
_ asking him to intervene to get BBC World restored and adding that 
the present fighting in Iraq made global news coverage more important 
than ever. ``I wrote of the importance of this international news 
channel, which is seen in a million Israeli households, especially 
at this critical time,'' Herzog said, adding that he asked if the 
communications ministry would make an effort equal to that it made 
when CNN was in a similar situation last year. Then, cable operators 
announced they were dropping the U.S. news channel, for financial 
reasons they said. That decision followed strident Israeli criticism 
of CNN for giving more airtime to the family of a Palestinian suicide 
bomber than to relatives of his victims, an Israeli woman and her 
1-year-old granddaughter. CNN acknowledged it had erred and broadcast 
a series of heavily promoted half-hour specials on Israeli victims 
of Palestinian terror attacks. Under government pressure, CNN and 
the cable operators reopened negotiations and in October reached a 
compromise, details of which were not disclosed. An Israeli parliamentarian, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the BBC case was not directly 
political but was affected by political factors, among which were 
the absence of a full-time communications minister and Sharon's preoccupation 
with other matters. Herzog appealed to all parties involved in the 
latest dispute to show flexibility and seek to resolve the issue. 
``I hope they can solve their differences,'' he said. ^ scw-pd

Jordanian Information Minister Mohammad Affash Adwan indicated there 
had been Iraqi attempts to undermine Jordan's security but refused 
to elaborate. ``This is purely a security matter which is being investigated 
and I can't discuss it further,'' Adwan told The Associated Press. 
The plot to contaminate water supplies involved five Iraqi diplomats 
expelled from Jordan on March 23, the sources said. They declined 
to provide other details, but said the water is pumped from Zarqa, 
27 kilometers (17 miles) northeast of the Jordanian capital Amman. 
Zarqa water plants feed distant villages in Jordan's eastern desert, 
where there are several army and air bases, including one near the 
Iraqi border where hundreds of U.S. soldiers are manning anti-missile 
batteries. ^ MORE &lt;

symptoms or who have been in contact with SARS patients. Now it is 
considering updating its advice to travelers to take account of SARS. 
Until now, its list mostly consists of advice on whether travelers 
need vaccinations or antimalarial tablets. But there is no vaccination 
available against SARS ``so the advice might be to avoid the area 
altogether,'' Heymann said. With cases already found in a number of 
European countries from air passengers who have been in the affected 
regions, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among European 
nations that already have advised residents against traveling there 
unless their trip is essential.

The hotel involved in the second plot was identified by sources as 
the Grand Hyatt, where a small fire in one of the hotel's upper floors 
last week was blamed on an electrical short circuit. Hyatt officials 
only said they were unaware of a terror plot. Iraqi Embassy spokesman 
Jawad al-Ali declined comment to the AP. But he told Paris-based Radio 
Monte Carlo that the allegations were ``completely untrue'' and that 
Iraq was keen to preserve Jordan's security. Jordan said when it expelled 
the five Iraqi diplomats that they had carried out actions ``incompatible'' 
with their diplomatic duties. The government later said two could 
stay, but the Iraqi embassy said all five had already left the country. 
Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said the expulsions were ordered on 
``security'' grounds. He and other government officials declined to 
elaborate, saying it was inappropriate to incite a public spat with 
Iraq as regional tension rose over U.S. and British bombardment of 
Jordan's eastern neighbor. One day following the deportation, Jordanian 
authorities detained four Iraqi transport officials for questioning. 
No details emerged from the interrogation, but officials said the 
four _ two employees with Iraqi Airways and two with a joint Jordanian-Iraqi 
transport company _ had been released. The expulsions and detentions 
fueled tension with Iraq, which already had been suspicious of Jordan 
for allowing U.S. troops to be stationed near its border, despite 
Jordanian assertions that the ``several hundred'' Americans were in 
the kingdom only for defensive purposes. Aware of strong anti-war 
sentiments among Jordanians, the government has been striving to distance 
itself from the conflict on Iraq _ supplier of all its oil needs at 
cheap prices. Trade with Iraq amounted to US$700 million last year, 
making it the largest importer of Jordanian goods. Jordan announced 
last week that oil from Iraq ceased on the first day of the war on 
March 20. Iraq blamed Jordan for the halted oil flow and accused the 
kingdom of blocking overland shipments of food and medicine. Jordan 
denied it, saying local exporters were concerned over road safety.

Prosecutors on Tuesday demanded a sentence of life in prison for the 
animal rights activist who confessed to murdering populist politician 
Pim Fortuyn shortly before Dutch elections last May. Presenting closing 
arguments in the trial of 33-year-old Volkert van der Graaf, lead 
prosecutor Koos Plooy said the nature of the crime justified the harshest 
sentence possible in the Netherlands, which has no death penalty. 
``No one must ever again get it into his head to follow this example, 
to frustrate the democratic process in this criminal and undemocratic 
way,'' Plooy said. Fortuyn, a colorful, well-spoken academic and columnist, 
was shot to death on May 6, 2002 in a parking lot after giving a radio 
interview in the town of Hilversum, 20 kilometers (13 miles) southeast 
of Amsterdam. He was contending for prime minister on a crime-busting, 
anti-immigration platform, and the murder thrust the country into 
political crisis. Van der Graaf's lawyer, Britta Bohler, argued for 
a lesser sentence, saying her client had cooperated by confessing 
and deserved a chance to rejoin society. She said a sentence for the 
rest of his days was ``unthinkable.'' ``He did commit the crime, but 
not with a morally reprehensible intention,'' she said in final comments, 
drawing loud objections from the public gallery. ``He did not view 
it (the murder) as an attack on democracy, but rather saw Fortuyn 
as a danger to democracy,'' Bohler said, recalling Fortuyn's desire 
to drop constitutional guarantees against discrimination. Judges were 
expected to issue a decision in several weeks. Plooy said Van der 
Graaf deserved the maximum punishment because he had admitted to Fortuyn's 
premeditated murder and shown little remorse. ``The only fitting penalty 
is a lifelong prison sentence,'' he said to cheers from Fortuyn's 
supporters in the courtroom. During three days of hearings at a high-security 
court in the Dutch capital, Van der Graaf said he had felt it his 
duty to kill Fortuyn, comparing his rise in popularity to that of 
Adolf Hitler. Van der Graaf said he still believes Fortuyn was a threat 
to Muslim immigrants and other ``vulnerable'' members of society. 
A psychological report presented in court said Van der Graaf is sane 
and can be held accountable for his crime, the first political killing 
in the Netherlands since World War II. Prosecutor Plooy pointed out 
inconsistencies in Van der Graaf's testimony, citing a note to his 
girlfriend in which he wrote: ``If I ever give a confession to the 
judges or media, then it doesn't necessarily have to be the truth.'' 
Before the assassination, Van der Graaf worked up to 80 hours a week 
litigating against commercial animal farming and was described by 
other activists as ``fanatic.'' He was to give a statement to judges 
later Tuesday. Van der Graaf has said he wouldn't commit the murder 
again if he could turn back time, but stopped short of apologizing 
to Fortuyn's family. He said he ``wrestles'' with the question of 
whether he acted justly. ``Every day I see it before me,'' he said 
Monday, ``I see myself shoot and Fortuyn fall.'' Several supporters 
wept silently in court Tuesday as Plooy described the ``cold and calculating'' 
manner in which Van der Graaf prepared and carried out the killing, 
walking casually past Fortuyn and shooting him five times from behind 
at close range. He attempted to escape on foot but was arrested minutes 
later with the murder weapon in his pocket, gunpowder on his hands, 
and traces of Fortuyn's DNA on his pants.

Congo's government and rebel groups on Tuesday endorsed a power-sharing 
agreement intended to end their 4 1/2-year civil war, but they remained 
at odds over how to share the top posts in a new national army. Representatives 
of the Congolese government, rebels, political parties and civic groups 
adopted by acclamation a transitional constitution, an agreement on 
sharing power in a transitional government, and a partial deal on 
defense and security arrangements The deals, grouped together in a 
document titled The Final Act, are supposed to be signed by leaders 
of all the groups Wednesday, mediators said. But it wasn't clear whether 
President Joseph Kabila and Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the rebel 
Congolese Liberation Movement or MLC, would attend the signing in 
this South African resort. Kabila and Bemba have not yet accepted 
a deal proposed by mediators under which their forces would merge 
with other rebel groups into a new national army. Kabila is supposed 
to give the deal his presidential assent within three days of Wednesday's 
planned signing ceremony, otherwise it would not be binding under 
Congolese law. Under the power-sharing deal, Kabila would lead the 
transitional government. Alongside him would be four vice presidents 
representing the present government, the two largest rebel groups 
and the unarmed political opposition. The transitional government 
is supposed to govern for up to 2 1/2 years, after which Africa's 
third-largest country would hold its first democratic elections since 
achieving independence from Belgium in 1960. Mediators welcomed Tuesday's 
endorsement but admitted the most difficult challenges lie ahead. 
``Implementation is the most painful aspect of the deals, because 
people will have to make concessions on the ground instead of on the 
paper,'' said George Ola-Davies, spokesman for the chief mediator, 
former Botswana President Ketumile Masire. ``It was easier for them 
to reach agreements in South Africa, but it will be much tougher for 
them to come together at home and make it work,'' Ola-Davies said. 
But Vital Kamerhe, a Congolese government spokesman, said he was optimistic 
that the deal would be implemented. ``Now we have a new constitution 
and a plan to work together with rebels, the political opposition 
and civil society in a new government,'' he said. The war in Congo 
broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to back 
rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila, Joseph's father. 
They accused him of backing insurgents threatening regional security. 
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to back Kabila, splitting 
the country into rebel-and government-held areas. Most foreign troops 
withdrew after a series of peace deals took hold. But last week Rwandan 
leaders renewed accusations that Kabila's government is violating 
their bilateral July 30 peace deal. They accused Kabila of continuing 
to arm Rwandan Hutu rebels who had fled to Congo in 1994 after killing 
more than half a million people, mostly minority Tutsis. Key rebel 
groups also accuse the Congolese government of deploying troops and 
military hardware in eastern Congo, contrary to the original 1999 
cease-fire. On Tuesday a German Catholic charity called Caritas said 
its secretary general in Congo, Abbe Jean Mwela Kibikie, had reports 
that troops as saying that troops from Rwanda and Burundi were redeploying 
in eastern Congo ``in large numbers.'' But Amos Namanga Ngongi, head 
of the United Nations mission in Congo, dismissed the report. ``I 
have military observers out there, and they have not told me anything 
about that,'' Ngongi said. ``As far as we know, there are remnants 
of Burundian troops, but we have not seen any Rwandans.'' (rn/ae-sp)

Allied warplanes and missiles blasted targets in Baghdad on Tuesday, 
including one of Saddam Hussein's palaces, Iraq's Olympic headquarters 
and what was believed to be an Iraqi Air Force officers club. A steady 
series of explosions rumbled south of the capital overnight _ probably 
against Republican Guard positions _ after some of the strongest blasts 
in the capital since the war began March 20. Six explosions in rapid 
succession shook central Baghdad late Monday night, sending smoke 
billowing from the Old Palace presidential compound and bathing the 
sky in a soft orange glow. American warplanes also dropped bombs on 
an Iraqi presidential yacht, U.S. Navy officials said, and the sound 
of more planes and heavy anti-aircraft fire could be heard over Baghdad 
late Tuesday afternoon. Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed 
al-Sahhaf said 56 people were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 
24 dead in Baghdad. He said nine children, including an infant, were 
killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers 
(50 miles) south of the capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately 
killing people,'' al-Sahhaf said. ``Hillah is my hometown. It is a 
civilian place.'' An explosion also rocked the Old Palace compound 
in Baghdad shortly after 9 p.m. Monday, and across the Tigris River, 
a target was hit less than a kilometer (mile) from the Palestine Hotel 
where many foreign journalists are staying. The 18-story hotel shook 
as if it had been struck by an earthquake. The target was believed 
to be a former Iraqi Air Force headquarters that was being used as 
a club for officers and their families, according to Iraqis familiar 
with the area. The building was reduced to a heap of gray rubble, 
a few pillars and an outside wall. A statue of Saddam just outside 
the building was intact. U.S. military officials said allied aircraft 
also bombed a complex that serves as the office of the Iraqi National 
Olympic Committee, where Saddam's son Odai is said to run a torture 
center. Human rights activists have accused him of jailing and brutalizing 
athletes. The lower four floors of the nine-story Olympic building 
were severely damaged. Walls were blown out, and mangled wire and 
steel protruded. The building sits in a big complex of housing units, 
and they appeared unscathed. Bombardments by the U.S.-led forces have 
focused recently on Republican Guard units protecting the approaches 
to Baghdad. The goal is to wear down Saddam's best-trained forces 
ahead of a U.S.-led ground assault on the capital. The Americans also 
had hoped to cut off television and radio transmissions to halt Iraqi 
propaganda, but repeated bombings have largely failed to silence the 
broadcasts. On Monday night, Saddam, Odai and Saddam's other son Qusai 
appeared on Iraqi television, with the station showing video footage 
of a meeting of top military commanders. There was no way of determining 
when the video was shot. A statement broadcast by Iraq TV also said 
Saddam's family members were in Iraq and had not fled, contrary to 
reports from Washington. Television also said Saddam decorated commanders 
and troops of army units in Umm Qasr, the Faw peninsula and Nasiriyah 
with medals and rewards of 2 million dinars _ about US$670 _ each.

Authorities have foiled two recent Iraqi terror plots, including one 
by Iraqi diplomats allegedly planning to contaminate water supplies 
to Jordanian and U.S. troops on Jordan's desert border with Iraq, 
diplomats said Tuesday. The second one _ in which four Iraqis were 
briefly arrested last week _ allegedly involved a plot to bomb a luxury 
hotel frequented by Americans and other Westerners, including about 
70 journalists, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Jordanian 
Information Minister Mohammad Affash Adwan indicated there had been 
Iraqi attempts to undermine Jordan's security but refused to elaborate. 
``This is purely a security matter which is being investigated and 
I can't discuss it further,'' Adwan told The Associated Press. The 
plot to contaminate water supplies involved five Iraqi diplomats expelled 
from Jordan on March 23, the sources said. They said the water is 
pumped from Zarqa, 27 kilometers (17 miles) northeast of the Jordanian 
capital Amman, but refused to provide other details. Zarqa water plants 
feed distant villages in Jordan's eastern desert, where there are 
several army and air bases, including one near the Iraqi border where 
hundreds of U.S. soldiers are manning anti-missile batteries. The 
hotel involved in the second plot was identified by sources as the 
Grand Hyatt, where a small fire in one of the hotel's upper floors 
last week was blamed on an electrical short circuit. Hyatt officials 
only said they were unaware of a terror plot. Iraqi Embassy spokesman 
Jawad al-Ali declined comment to the AP. But he told Paris-based Radio

A fire that caused serious damage to a 17th-century castle in suburban 
Berlin, protected under UNESCO's World Heritage List, may have been 
caused by building work, police said Tuesday. The fire at the Jagdschloss 
Glienicke, which broke out Monday afternoon, destroyed much of the 
roof and the top story of the building before some 150 firefighters 
were able to bring it under control. The Berlin city government said 
it was too early to estimate the cost of the damage to the castle, 
which is used as a conference center. The castle, built in 1683 and 
renovated in 1859, is situated in extensive parkland close the Glienicke 
Bridge, famed as a venue for spy exchanges between East and West during 
the Cold War. Police said the castle's tower had been set up for work 
on wooden and metal structures at the time of the fire, and they were 
consulting with contractors to determine whether that work was to 
blame. ^ (gm-cb &lt;

Police on Tuesday arrested a senior leader of an outlawed Islamic 
extremist group, who allegedly planned attacks on minority religious 
groups in Pakistan. Shabira Fauji of the banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi 
group was captured in an early morning raid at a house in Multan, 
635 kilometers (395 miles) south of Islamabad, said regional police 
chief Malik Murid Hussain. Fauji is suspected of planning and carrying 
out dozens of attacks on minority Shiites Muslims in this predominantly 
Sunni Muslim country. His group has been accused of killing hundreds 
of Shiite Muslims. In 1990, they were responsible for slaying Sadiq 
Ganji, a diplomat from Iran which is a theocratic Shiite country. 
Several police officers also have died in gun battles or attacks. 
Hussain said Fauji was behind an attack on the Iranian Culture Center 
in Multan in 1997 that left seven people dead, in what was believed 
to be a reprisal for the killing of a senior leader of a radical Sunni 
group. ``We hope his arrest will help control religiously motivated 
killings,'' Hussain said at a news conference. Fauji, who was born 
Shabir Ahmed and whose adopted name means ``army,'' had a 1 million 
rupee ($16,950) reward on his head. Hussain did not say if anyone 
was being given the money for Fauji's arrest. Fauji has been on Pakistan's 
most wanted list since 2002, when police killed the chief of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, 
Riaz Basra, in a shootout. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was one of seven militant 
groups outlawed 15 months ago by President Pervez Musharraf in an 
attempt to end the killings among Shiites and Sunnis. But religious 
violence has barely slackened here. Dozens of people are killed each 
year, most of them Shiites and Christians. Historically, many Sunnis 
regard Shiites as heretics because of a dispute dating back to the 
7th century and centering on the rightful heir to Islam's leadership 
following the death of the Prophet Muhammad.

A boat carrying nearly 40 villagers sank in a river in western Bangladesh 
on Tuesday, killing at least nine people, a news report said. Four 
others were missing. The overcrowded wooden boat apparently sank after 
water gushed in through a hole in its hull while it was crossing the 
Padma River in Chapainawabganj district, private television network 
Channel-i said. The region, which borders India, is 230 kilometers 
(145 miles) west of the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Most of the passengers 
managed to swim ashore, while rescuers recovered nine bodies _ including 
those of two children _ from the river, the network reported. Four 
other passengers were unaccounted for. The boat's passengers were 
mostly Bangladeshi Hindus on their way to visit a religious carnival 
in India's Murshidabad district on the other side of the river. Hindus 
make up about 10 percent of the mostly Muslim nation's 130 million 
people.

The people, including a woman carrying a baby in her arms, began leaving 
the plane shortly after 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT), jumping from the open 
back hatch of the craft into the arms of emergency workers below. 
A bus pulled up on the tarmac near the plane to take away the group 
of at least 15 people, which appeared to include several children. 
Cuban authorities originally had reported there were six children 
among the 46 people on the craft. It was not immediately clear what 
was happening aboard the plane that led to the release of the passengers 
after the hijacking drama that began almost 12 hours before when a 
man claiming to be armed with grenades demanded to be flown to Florida.

Unable to prevent the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Russia is trying to carve 
out a role for itself and burnish its human rights record by immediately 
sending aid for the potential victims. President Vladimir Putin has 
warned of a ``humanitarian catastrophe'' in Iraq, and Russia last 
week laid the groundwork for tent camps in Iran that could house 5,000 
refugees. On Tuesday, a Russian doctor announced an effort to evacuate 
wounded children from Iraq and urged the United States to cooperate 
with the initiative, which would require a temporary halt to hostilities 
in Baghdad and Basra. ``If America says, for instance, from 1800 hours 
to 2400 hours we will not bomb,'' then children could be evacuated, 
pediatrician Leonid Roshal told a news conference. Roshal, who is 
working alongside the Russian Red Cross on the evacuation effort, 
said the idea was his own but that Putin has expressed support. Putin 
decorated Roshal for aiding hostages seized by Chechen rebels in a 
Moscow theater last October. Roshal had defended Russian security 
forces' use of a gas that led to the deaths of more than 120 hostages, 
saying it was the only way to end the crisis without massive loss 
of life. Roshal said the first step in the Iraq program would be to 
try to remove wounded children, who could be treated in Russia and 
other countries and returned to Iraq after the war. He said the Iraqis 
had told him of 95 wounded children in hospitals, but said the figure 
should be verified. Meanwhile, the Russian government's aid mission 
near Iraq has had little effect: So far, there are no refugees in 
the area of Iran where complete supplies for two camps are ready, 
said Viktor Beltsov, spokesman for the Emergency Situations Ministry, 
which is running the operation near the city of Kermanshah. Nonetheless, 
Beltsov said, ``Russia plans to augment its humanitarian efforts in 
the region'' and is prepared to set up a field hospital if needed. 
It's a role Russia took on in Afghanistan, where Moscow emphasized 
it would not fight but showed it would do its part in the U.S.-led 
war against terrorism by establishing a significant humanitarian presence 
with aid shipments and a field hospital in Kabul. In Iraq, however, 
the emphasis on aid comes hand in hand with vehement criticism of 
the war and U.S. foreign policy. The Russian efforts around Iraq come 
amid U.S. accusations that Russian companies provided military aid 
to Baghdad and amid long-standing criticism from rights groups about 
Moscow's treatment of victims of its own wars in Chechnya. ``It's 
necessary to help first of all refugees from Chechnya in Ingushetia, 
who have been living in tattered tents for years,'' said Lev Ponomaryov, 
director of the For Human Rights organization and an opponent of the 
Iraq war. ``I cannot condemn humanitarian actions that help people 
survive,'' Ponomaryov said. ``But it looks inconsistent of Putin, 
and I would point out that tens of thousands of refugees in Ingushetia 
need humanitarian aid.'' (sbg/ji/jh)

The Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on a flight from 
Cuba's small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced to land in the 
capital because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it to the United 
States, Cuban authorities said. The plane spent the night on a tarmac 
at the Havana airport and shortly after daybreak, a tank with a hose 
was rolled out onto the tarmac and appeared to be refueling the craft. 
The plane was surrounded by several dozen uniformed police officers, 
and two fire trucks and numerous ambulances were parked nearby. It 
would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access 
to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily 
guarded by the military. It was also unclear how anyone would be able 
to get a pair of grenades through the heavy security checks at Cuba's 
airports, especially less than two weeks after a successful hijacking 
on the same route of a passenger plane to the United States. All incoming 
and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport 
appeared suspended during the negotiations. An Iberia Airlines flight 
to Madrid was grounded and photographers and cameramen at the scene 
said that they had seen no takeoffs or landings for several hours. 
A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made 
Cuban Airlines plane was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle 
of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that 
the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with 
grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake 
the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and 
lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement. The statement 
blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana says is the lax treatment 
that six other suspected hijackers received last month after successfully 
forcing another passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at 
knifepoint. The suspects in the earlier successful hijack were charged 
with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence and face 
a minimum of up to 20 years in federal prison. They were granted bond, 
but remain behind bars because they have been unable to come up with 
the money. Cuban authorities were pleased that American officials 
decided to charge the six but were enraged last week when a federal 
judge decided to set bond over the objections of prosecutors. ``The 
entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) 
will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement 
said of the United States. In the successful hijacking, six crew members 
and 25 passengers were on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route 
on March 19 when knife-wielding hijackers took control of the plane 
as it descended toward Havana after a trip from the Isle of Youth. 
They diverted the plane to Key West. The earlier hijack occurred as 
the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched. American fighter jets 
scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs 
Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane 
to Key West. Sixteen of those aboard later opted to return to Cuba 
and the only non-Cuban on the flight, an Italian, was released in 
the United States. The rest of the passengers and crew members on 
that earlier flight opted to stay in the United States under a U.S. 
immigration policy that allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay 
and seek legal residency after a year.

British and U.S. military officials said Tuesday that Iraqi civilians 
are providing more assistance to coalition forces and more information 
on paramilitary and other forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. In southern 
Iraq, British troops are beginning to replace helmets with berets, 
lights are flickering on in the port city of Umm Qasr, and schools 
and shops were reopening _ possibly indicating the tide of the war 
in the region was turning, British officials said. ``Within the southern 
area of Iraq, we see a large degree of normality starting to appear 
amongst the Iraqi population,'' said Group Capt. Al Lockwood, a spokesman 
for British forces in the Gulf. Significantly, more civilians were 
informing foreign troops about the whereabouts of paramilitary forces 
and members of Saddam's Baath Party, British officials said. At a 
briefing at U.S Central Command in Qatar, U.S. Brig. Gen. Vincent 
Brooks described several instances in which local residents had helped 
U.S. forces throughout the country, paving the way for successful 
attacks against ``death squads'' loyal to Saddam. In one case north 
of the south-central town of Nasiriyah, 100 local tribesmen joined 
U.S. soldiers in capturing Iraqi military prisoners and removing explosives 
from a bridge, Brooks said. Lockwood stressed that tensions were still 
high in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city where British forces have 
skirmished almost daily with forces loyal to Saddam while trying to 
provide humanitarian aid to the city's 1.3 million people. Qatar-based 
satellite channel Al-Jazeera reported that schools and administrative 
offices in Basra were closed Tuesday on order of Iraqi authorities 
to avoid civilian casualties should they get caught in fighting. And 
military operations continued in the region, including a raid on Baath 
party members in Safwan, said another British spokesman, Col. Chris 
Vernon. Lockwood said residents were increasingly willing to approach 
British troops who have ringed Basra to give information about known 
paramilitaries and other loyalists. ``They realize that we are there 
to liberate them, not to occupy,'' he said. ``Certainly, there are 
still military engagements happening with the paramilitary forces, 
but the aid is flowing into Basra now.'' Also Tuesday, British troops 
had changed their combat helmets for berets in some southern Iraq 
towns _ making soldiers appear more friendly and approachable, British 
officials said. ``It shows that we have confidence in them, and they 
can have confidence in us,'' he said. Brooks spent much of the Qatar 
briefing answering questions about the shooting of seven civilians 
by U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint Monday. He said U.S. forces were 
in a state of heightened alert after a suicide attack on Saturday 
that killed four Americans. ``In all cases in checkpoints and otherwise 
we maintain the right to self-defense,'' Brooks said. ``We've increased 
vigilance because of the tactics of Iraqi death squads. ``While we 
regret the loss of civilian lives, they remain unavoidable,'' he said. 
Brooks blamed the Iraqi regime for using civilians as human shields 
and punishing those who seem to favor coalition forces. But he acknowledged 
he didn't know whether the passengers in the checkpoint shooting were 
being used as human shields and conceded they may have been fleeing 
Najaf in fear. He said Iraqis have been receiving constant instructions 
by coalition radio and television programs about not approaching troops. 
Iraqi fighters have shot women in the back on bridges, put babies 
in the line of fire and hanged one woman who simply waved to coalition 
forces, he said. He said despite the threats by the Iraqi regime on 
its own population, ``people are bold and they're becoming bolder.'' 
U.S. and British officials have acknowledged there have been few hoped-for 
uprisings by anti-Saddam Shiite residents of Basra and other southern 
towns in support of coalition troops. They have attributed residents' 
wariness to the fact that when Shiites did rise up in 1991, allied 
forces largely abandoned them and left them to be punished or killed 
by the Iraqi leadership.

The United Nations should send human rights monitors to Iraq as soon 
as the security situation allows such a move, a U.N. expert said Tuesday. 
``I would go tomorrow if the circumstances allowed it,'' Andreas Mavrommatis 
told a session of the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. ``There 
is a lot to be gained by a U.N. presence in Iraq in the future in 
the field of human rights.'' The Cypriot specialist presented a 15-page 
report on the rights situation in Iraq to the commission, which is 
currently holding its annual six week session. The report, which was 
prepared before the start of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, makes no direct 
reference to the conflict. But in his speech to the commission Mavrommatis 
urged both sides to ``scrupulously observe international humanitarian 
law and shield the civilian population from the consequences of war.'' 
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed 
for US$1.6 million to send observers to Iraq ``when conditions permit,'' 
spokesman Jose Diaz said Tuesday. Mavrommatis said he reiterated all 
his recommendations from previous reports. Last year, he urged Iraq 
to adopt a moratorium on executions, reduce the number of crimes which 
carry the death penalty and improve prison conditions. He also criticized 
discrimination against Iraq's Kurds and Shiite Muslims, who have suffered 
under Saddam Hussein's rule. Cooperation with Iraq was ``a slow, painstaking 
process,'' Mavrommatis said. Baghdad's replies to his questions and 
recommendations ``are at times incomplete and unsatisfactory.'' Mavrommatis 
was appointed in 1999 and visited the country for the first time in 
February 2002 at the invitation of Iraqi authorities. He planned a 
further visit earlier this year but ``unfolding events in Iraq forced 
me to postpone second visit to the country,'' he told the commission. 
Instead, he met with diplomats from Iraq's mission to U.N. European 
offices in Geneva on three occasions. Iraqi Ambassador Samir al-Nima 
said the report was influenced by ``unwarranted and unjustified political 
considerations,'' and failed to address violations by coalition forces 
attacking Iraq. He said Baghdad had cooperated properly with the U.N. 
expert but Mavrommatis had relied too heavily on ``information from 
sources hostile to Iraq.'' Even as war loomed, Mavrommatis ``should 
have visited Iraq, to ensure his report was credible,'' al-Nima said. 
He and other U.N. human rights officials now ``must visit Iraq immediately 
to see for themselves the human rights violations perpetrated by the 
bloody hands of the invaders of the 21st Century,'' the ambassador 
said. Mavrommatis told reporters later that he was ``steering clear 
of politics,'' but noted he had deplored both civilian losses and 
suicide bombings aimed at coalition forces. ``We are all praying that 
an end will come soon to this war,'' he said. Mavrommatis said he 
had taken a less confrontational approach than other U.N. experts 
in an attempt to enlist the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities. 
The approach had achieved some results, such as the general amnesty 
last October that freed 25,000 inmates after he had urged the step 
as a way to ease appalling prison conditions. ``I was shocked by the 
overcrowding,'' Mavrommatis said. ^ (jf-nk-agh) &lt;

FRANKFURT, Germany _ The slump at Germany's big banks is dragging 
down another of the country's financial heavyweights _ reinsurer Munich 
Re, whose large stakes in its fellow financial institutions have magnified 
the impact of falling stock markets on the company. The reason isn't 
so much in Munich Re's basic business of selling backup coverage to 
insurance companies, which analysts say is turning around. Much of 
the headache comes from the German tradition in which the country's 
big businesses own large chunks of each other. Munich Re, which is 
the world's largest reinsurer, has seen its shares slide rapidly since 
it announced last week that 5.7 billion euros (US$6.2 billion) in 
losses on stakes in other companies had sapped its earnings. That 
started a spiral of bad news, as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors 
lowered Munich Re's financial-strength rating and investors sold off 
the stock. It traded at around 55 euros (US$59) Tuesday _ down more 
than 30 percent from just under 82 euros before last week's announcement, 
and down 86 percent from its peak of 387 euros in 2001. Munich Re 
owns 25 percent in struggling HVB bank, which lost 858 million euros 
(US$927 million) last year, and 20 percent in primary insurer Allianz, 
which lost 1.2 billion euros (US$1.4 billion) and owns Dresdner Bank. 
Dresdner Bank reported a 1.4 billion euro (US$1.6 billion) loss for 
2002. In addition, Allianz owns 25 percent of Munich Re, and Commerzbank, 
the country's fourth largest, owns 10 percent. All invest heavily 
in stocks and have been victims of the current bear market on their 
own terms. But the crossed shareholdings makes trouble contagious, 
since when one stock falls, the other companies' shares _ and subsequently 
their earnings _ suffer along with it. ``The connection between Allianz, 
HVB and Munich is particularly bad,'' said analyst Ralf Dibbern at 
M.M. Warburg in Hamburg. ``Every time one goes down, the others follow, 
that's the problem.'' The bank's troubles and falling stock markets 
have proved bigger financial trouble for Munich Re than the Sept. 
11, 2001 terror attacks, which cost it 2.6 billion euros in damage 
claims spread over two years _ but only dented the stock price briefly. 
Munich Re says it will seek to replenish its finances with a bond 
issue, the size of which is still being decided as the company tests 
institutional investors' appetite this week with presentations in 
Paris, Amsterdam, London and Frankfurt. But some investors fear Munich 
Re may be forced to do what Allianz did last week _ announce it would 
increase its capital by issuing new shares. Shareholders hate that 
because it dilutes the value of their holdings. The company says it 
won't. ``There is no question of a capital increase,'' said spokesman 
Florian Woest. Ironically, the crash in the company's stock price 
comes as some think its basic business is turning around. After the 
huge losses of Sept. 11, Munich Re and other reinsurers took steps 
to lessen their dependence on stock market gains by raising prices 
and capping coverage. ``I am positive on their underwriting business,'' 
said Warburg analyst Dibbern. Munich Re had net profit of 1.1 billion 
euros (US$1.3 billion) but would have shown a loss without one-time 
gains from 4.7 billion from selling part of its stake in Allianz and 
its subsidiaries. Reinsurers have in essence two businesses: collecting 
premiums and paying claims, and the potentially more lucrative _ but 
unpredictable _ investment of premium proceeds on stock markets. Further 
sudden drops in the stock market could mean trouble, Dibbern said: 
``That's another matter _ if equity markets fall another 20 percent, 
then the situation is different.'' In addition, Munich Re and Allianz 
plan to cut their stakes in each other to 15 percent _ below the 20 
percent threshold where they must show their share of the other's 
losses in their earnings, and lessening some of the vicious circle's 
effect. (dm-cb)

Authorities have foiled two recent Iraqi terror plots, including one 
by Iraqi diplomats allegedly planning to contaminate water supplies 
to Jordanian and U.S. troops on Jordan's desert border with Iraq, 
diplomats said Tuesday. The second one _ in which four Iraqis were 
briefly arrested last week _ allegedly involved a plot to bomb a luxury 
hotel frequented by Americans and other Westerners, including about 
70 journalists, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Jordanian 
Information Minister Mohammad Affash Adwan indicated there had been 
Iraqi attempts to undermine Jordan's security but refused to elaborate. 
``This is purely a security matter which is being investigated and 
I can't discuss it further,'' Adwan told The Associated Press. The 
plot to contaminate water supplies involved five Iraqi diplomats expelled 
from Jordan on March 23, the sources said. They said the water is 
pumped from Zarqa, 27 kilometers (17 miles) northeast of the Jordanian 
capital Amman, but refused to provide other details. Zarqa water plants 
feed distant villages in Jordan's eastern desert, where there are 
several army and air bases, including one near the Iraqi border where 
hundreds of U.S. soldiers are manning anti-missile batteries. The 
hotel involved in the second plot was identified by sources as the 
Grand Hyatt, where a small fire in one of the hotel's upper floors 
last week was blamed on an electrical short circuit. Hyatt officials 
only said they were unaware of a terror plot. Iraqi Embassy spokesman 
Jawad al-Ali declined comment to the AP. But he told Paris-based Radio 
Monte Carlo that the allegations were ``completely untrue'' and that 
Iraq was keen to preserve Jordan's security. Jordan said when it expelled 
the five Iraqi diplomats that they had carried out actions ``incompatible'' 
with their diplomatic duties. The government later said two could 
stay, but the Iraqi embassy said all five had already left the country. 
Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said the expulsions were ordered on 
``security'' grounds. He and other government officials declined to 
elaborate, saying it was inappropriate to incite a public spat with 
Iraq as regional tension rose over the U.S. and British bombardment 
of Jordan's eastern neighbor. One day after the deportations, Jordanian 
authorities detained four Iraqi transport officials for questioning. 
No details emerged from the interrogation, but officials said the 
four _ two employees with Iraqi Airways and two with a joint Jordanian-Iraqi 
transport company _ had been released. Early last month, U.S. officials 
said they had asked about 60 countries to expel 300 Iraqis said to 
be undercover agents possibly poised to attack American interests 
overseas. Some of the 300 were operating as diplomats out of Iraqi 
embassies, U.S. officials said. Several countries expelled Iraqi diplomats 
then, citing spying accusations or their involvement in activities 
``incompatible with their diplomatic status.'' After launching the 
war, the United States asked all countries to expel Iraqi diplomats 
and close their embassies. Few countries responded positively. Jordan 
denied its expulsions were related to the U.S. request. But the actions 
fueled tension with Iraq, which already had been suspicious of Jordan 
for allowing U.S. troops to be stationed near its border, despite 
Jordanian assertions that the ``several hundred'' Americans were in 
the kingdom only for defensive purposes. Aware of strong anti-war 
sentiments among Jordanians, the government has been striving to distance 
itself from the conflict on Iraq _ supplier of all its oil needs at 
cheap prices. Trade with Iraq amounted to US$700 million last year, 
making it the largest importer of Jordanian goods. Jordan announced 
last week that oil from Iraq ceased on the first day of the war on 
March 20. Iraq blamed Jordan for the halted oil flow and accused the 
kingdom of blocking overland shipments of food and medicine. Jordan 
denied it, saying local exporters were concerned over road safety.

American forces have enough bombs and missiles for the Iraq war, despite 
an intensifying air campaign focused on destroying the Republican 
Guard forces arrayed around Baghdad, U.S. military officials say. 
U.S.-led forces launched missiles early Tuesday toward Baghdad and 
the holy Shiite Muslim city of Karbala to the southwest. Among the 
targets, U.S. officials said, was a complex that serves as the office 
of the Iraqi National Olympic Committee, where Iraqi dissidents say 
Saddam's son Odai runs a torture center. U.S. warplanes used more 
than 3,000 precision-guided bombs on Iraqi targets over the weekend, 
compared to about 5,000 in the previous week, said Maj. Gen. Stanley 
McChrystal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He said coalition forces 
had fired more than 700 Tomahawk cruise missiles. The United States 
can switch to other munitions if it runs low on the $600,000 Tomahawks, 
said Marine Col. Tom Bright of U.S. Central Command. ``While we've 
used a significant amount, we are not dependent on them for the success 
of our operations,'' Bright said Monday night on CNN television's 
``Larry King Live'' program. The U.S.-led air assault has severely 
damaged the Republican Guard units defending Baghdad, military officials 
said Monday. They include the Medina, Hammurabi and Baghdad divisions 
south of the capital and units of the Nebuchadnezzar division, which 
is normally stationed far north of Baghdad, which have moved south 
as reinforcements. ``We are going to continue to drop weapons on these 
units until they either surrender or until they are destroyed,'' Gen. 
Peter Pace, the No. 2 officer on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on 
PBS television's ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.'' Bombing in the Iraqi 
capital also has intensified, with repeated hits on the Information 
Ministry and telephone exchanges aimed at cutting off communications 
from Saddam Hussein's government. As fighting south of the Iraqi capital 
continued Monday, U.S. troops killed at least seven Iraqi women and 
children at a checkpoint when the driver of a van they were riding 
in failed to stop as ordered, Central Command said. An American reporter 
with the Army unit involved said 10 were killed, including five preschool-age 
children. The U.S. military is investigating the incident. Maj. Gen. 
Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, said his 
soldiers fired several warning shots at the vehicle and ``it continued 
to come.'' An Iraqi soldier in civilian clothing killed four soldiers 
from the same 3rd Infantry Division at a nearby checkpoint with a 
car bomb on Saturday. ``I guess the driver panicked and hit the accelerator 
and basically was charging the unit there,'' Blount said in an interview 
Tuesday on ABC television's ``Good Morning America.'' ``It could just 
as easily have been a suicide bomber.'' The soldiers involved ``absolutely 
did the right thing,'' Pace said. ``Our soldiers on the ground have 
an absolute right to defend themselves.'' Iraqi Information Minister 
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf strongly criticized the incident and other 
instances of civilian deaths in the war. ``They are becoming more 
tense and hysterical,'' he told a Tuesday morning press conference 
in Baghdad. In the strongest suggestion yet from the Pentagon that 
Saddam may be dead, Pace said intelligence sources have shown no indication 
that the Iraqi leader is alive following a March 19 airstrike on a 
bunker he was believed to be using in Baghdad. That information comes 
from the same intelligence sources that pinpointed Saddam's location 
before the airstrike, Pace said. ``That doesn't mean he's dead, but 
he's not visible publicly and he's not been seen or reported to have 
been seen by anybody,'' Pace said. Meanwhile, fresh U.S. forces were 
flowing to the Gulf, including 500 members of an Army cavalry regiment 
being sent ahead of schedule to help protect U.S. supply lines from 
Iraqi attack. McChrystal, vice director of operations on the Pentagon's 
Joint Staff, told a news conference that more than 300,000 allied 
forces were in the Gulf region, about 250,000 of them American. Last 
Friday his boss, Gen. Richard Myers, had put the allied total at 270,000. 
McChrystal would not discuss specific missions of the additional forces 
that were en route to the Gulf or getting ready to go.

Congolese groups on Tuesday endorsed a power-sharing agreement intended 
to end a 4 1/2-year civil war in their country, but the government 
and a key rebel group remained at odds over their representation in 
a new national army. Representatives of the Congolese government, 
rebel groups, political parties and civil society adopted by acclamation 
a transitional constitution, an agreement on sharing power in a transitional 
government and a partial deal on defense and security arrangements 
The deals, grouped under a document called The Final Act, are supposed 
to be formally signed by leaders of the groups Wednesday, mediators 
said. It was not clear whether Congolese President Joseph Kabila and 
Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of one of the two main rebel groups, would 
attend the signing in this South African resort, said Vital Kamerhe, 
a Congolese government spokesman. Kabila's government and Bemba's 
Congolese Liberation Movement, or MLC, have yet to accept a deal proposed 
by mediators under which they would meld their forces _ with those 
of other rebel groups _ into a new national army. Kabila is supposed 
to give the deal his presidential assent three days after the signing 
to make it legally binding under Congolese law. Under the power-sharing 
deal, Kabila would lead the transitional government, aided by four 
vice presidents _ one each from the present government, the two main 
rebel groups and the unarmed political opposition. The transitional 
government is supposed to govern for up to 2 1/2 years, after which 
Africa's third largest country would hold its first democratic elections 
since independence from Belgium in 1960. Mediators welcomed Tuesday's 
endorsement but admitted the most difficult challenges lie ahead. 
``Implementation is the most painful aspect of the deals because people 
will have to make concessions on the ground instead of on the paper,'' 
said George Ola-Davies, spokesman for the chief mediator, former Botswana 
President Ketumile Masire. ``It was easier for them to reach agreements 
in South Africa, but it would be much tougher for them to come together 
at home and make it work.'' But government spokesman Kamerhe was optimistic 
that the deal would be implemented. ``Now we have a new constitution 
and a plan to work together with rebels, the political opposition 
and civil society in a new government,'' he said. The war in Congo 
broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda and Uganda sent troops to back 
Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-President Laurent Kabila, Joseph's 
father. They accused him of backing insurgents threatening regional 
security. Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to back Kabila, 
splitting the country into rebel-and government-held areas. Most foreign 
troops withdrew after a series of peace deals took hold. But last 
week Rwanda renewed accusations that Kabila's government is violating 
their bi-lateral July 30 peace deal by continuing to arm Rwandan Hutu 
rebels who fled to Congo after carrying out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda 
in which more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderates 
from the Hutu majority were killed. Key rebel groups also accuse the 
Congolese government of preparing for war by deploying troops and 
military hardware in eastern Congo, contrary to the original 1999 
cease-fire, which also envisaged the power-sharing deal. On Tuesday, 
the German branch of the Roman Catholic charity, Caritas, quoted the 
agency's secretary general in Congo, Abbe Jean Mwela Kibikie, as saying 
that troops from neighboring Rwanda and Burundi that had pulled out 
of eastern Congo last year had returned ``in large numbers.'' Amos 
Namanga Ngongi, head of the U.N. mission in Congo, dismissed the report. 
``I have military observers out there, and they have not told me anything 
about that,'' Ngongi said. ``As far as we know, there are remnants 
of Burundian troops, but we have not seen any Rwandans.''

Forward Dennis Rommedahl, who scored two goals in Denmark's 5-2 win 
against Romania, and defender Thomas Rytter said Tuesday they're ready 
to take on Bosnia-Herzegovina in this week's Euro 2004 qualifier. 
Group 2 leader Denmark, which beat Romania Saturday in Bucharest, 
plays Bosnia Wednesday in the capital, Copenhagen. It was good news 
for coach Morten Olsen whose team has been plagued by injuries. The 
1992 European Champions will meet Bosnia without veterans Thomas Helveg, 
Thomas Roel Larsen, Jesper Groenkjaer and Christian Poulsen, all of 
whom are injured. Martin Lauersen is out of the lineup, too, suspended 
after getting a second yellow card in Saturday's game. After Tuesday's 
training session, Rommedahl and Rytter said they were fit to fight. 
``I think it looks good,'' Rytter told Danish public radio. ``Time 
will tell whether I'll be in the lineup.'' The Wolfsburg defender 
played 34 minutes against Romania and left the sandy pitch with back 
and thigh pain. Rommedahl who had a sore thigh muscle but was expected 
to be ready, said he was ready for the game at Parken Stadium. Denmark 
and Norway top Group 2 with seven points each, but the Danes lead

As the trickle of governing Popular Party anti-war resignations continued 
Tuesday, Spanish opposition parties presented another motion in Parliament 
condemning the attacks while tens of thousands of students staged 
more protests across the country. The resignation of councilor Edith 
Bedin Oviedo from the small central town of Damiel was the 14th so 
far in the party in protest over the U.S. and British invasion and 
the Spanish ruling party's support for it. So far no parliamentary 
deputy has resigned, although more than one has begun to voice opposition 
to the war which started March 20. Up to recently, support for Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar within his party had seemed airtight, with 
little public dissent. Aznar is one of the firmest advocates of the 
U.S.-led drive to oust Saddam Hussein although the vast majority of 
Spaniards are opposed to the war. ``What's strange is not that there 
should be discrepancies within the PP over its involvement in the 
war but rather that they should take so long in coming out,'' the 
leading daily El Pais said in an editorial. But Popular Party parliamentary 
spokesman Luis de Grandes said the dissension showed that the party 
was pluralist. Other party leaders put the resignations down to the 
fact that the outgoing deputies were not included in upcoming municipal 
election lists. Also Tuesday, tens of thousands of university students 
took to streets again in at least 10 cities to protest the war and 
demand Aznar's resignation. In Parliament, the leading opposition 
Socialist party was to put to vote a motion calling on Aznar to change 
tack and launch a call to stop the war. ``One step backward (for Aznar) 
would be one step forward for peace,'' party Parliamentary spokesman 
Jesus Caldera told reporters. The motion is expected to be backed 
en bloc by the opposition parties and rejected by the majority-ruling 
183 Popular Party members. (cg/dw)

A group of passengers aboard a plane hijacked by a man who claimed 
to have two grenades and demanded to be taken to the United States 
began leaving the craft early Tuesday after a tense night of negotiations. 
The people, including a woman carrying a small child in her arms, 
began leaving the plane shortly after 1400 GMT, jumping from the open 
back hatch of the craft into the arms of emergency workers below. 
A bus pulled up on the tarmac near the plane to take away the group 
of at least 15 people, which appeared to include several children. 
Cuban authorities originally had reported there were six children 
among the 46 people on the craft. It was not immediately clear what 
was happening aboard the plane that led to the release of the passengers 
after the hijacking drama that began almost 12 hours before when a 
man claiming to be armed with grenades demanded to be flown to Florida. 
The Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on a flight from 
Cuba's small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced to land in the 
capital because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it to the United 
States, Cuban authorities said. The plane spent the night on a tarmac 
at the Havana airport and shortly after daybreak, a tank with a hose 
was rolled out onto the tarmac and appeared to be refueling the craft. 
The plane was surrounded by several dozen uniformed police officers, 
and two fire trucks and numerous ambulances were parked nearby. It 
would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access 
to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily 
guarded by the military. It was also unclear how anyone would be able 
to get a pair of grenades through the heavy security checks at Cuba's 
airports, especially less than two weeks after a successful hijacking 
on the same route of a passenger plane to the United States. All incoming 
and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport 
appeared suspended during the negotiations. An Iberia Airlines flight 
to Madrid was grounded and photographers and cameramen at the scene 
said that they had seen no takeoffs or landings for several hours. 
A government statement released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made 
Cuban Airlines plane was on a regular passenger flight from the Isle 
of Youth's main city of Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that 
the craft was being hijacked to the United States by a man armed with 
grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, for their part, will undertake 
the maximum effort to find a solution that preserves the safety and 
lives of passengers and crew members,'' said the statement. The statement 
blamed the hijacking attempt on what Havana says is the lax treatment 
that six other suspected hijackers received last month after successfully 
forcing another passenger plane from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at 
knifepoint. The suspects in the earlier successful hijack were charged 
with conspiracy to seize an aircraft by force and violence and face 
a minimum of up to 20 years in federal prison. They were granted bond, 
but remain behind bars because they have been unable to come up with 
the money. Cuban authorities were pleased that American officials 
decided to charge the six but were enraged last week when a federal 
judge decided to set bond over the objections of prosecutors. ``The 
entire responsibility of what could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) 
will fall on the government of that country,'' the Cuban statement 
said of the United States. In the successful hijacking, six crew members 
and 25 passengers were on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route 
on March 19 when knife-wielding hijackers took control of the plane 
as it descended toward Havana after a trip from the Isle of Youth. 
They diverted the plane to Key West. The earlier hijack occurred as 
the U.S.-led war on Iraq was being launched. American fighter jets 
scrambled from Homestead Air Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs 
Black Hawk helicopter joined them to escort the blue and white plane 
to Key West. Sixteen of those aboard later opted to return to Cuba 
and the only non-Cuban on the flight, an Italian, was released in 
the United States. The rest of the passengers and crew members on 
that earlier flight opted to stay in the United States under a U.S. 
immigration policy that allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay 
and seek legal residency after a year.

The Czech government said Tuesday it is planning to send a mobile 
military field hospital to the Gulf in response to a new U.N. Security 
Council resolution that would restart a humanitarian aid program for 
Iraq. Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla told a news conference Tuesday 
that the medical unit, with 250 staff members, would first be deployed 
to Kuwait, joining a Czech anti-chemical warfare unit already stationed 
there. ``Then a decision will be made on where to move it, depending 
on where its aid will be needed the most,'' Spidla said. He said the 
hospital will be allowed to operate both inside and outside of Iraq. 
The move still requires approval by both chambers of parliament. It 
was not immediately clear when lawmakers would vote on the measure, 
but it's approval was considered likely. Defense Minister Jaroslav 
Tvrdik said the hospital itself would be ready to leave for the Gulf 
by April 5. The Czech Republic, a formerly communist country of 10 
million which has been a NATO member since 1999, is not part of the 
coalition at war against Iraq, but has 400 anti-chemical warfare specialists 
stationed in Kuwait in the event Iraq uses weapons of mass destruction. 
Spidla said Tuesday the hospital too will not operate under the coalition's 
leadership and will have a purely humanitarian function. On Friday, 
the U.N. Security Council voted to resume a massive U.N. humanitarian 
program for Iraq once the U.S.-led war subsides. (nr/vg)

American soldiers shot and killed at least seven Iraqi women and children 
at a checkpoint in southern Iraq, an action that could undermine coalition 
efforts to win over the Iraqi people. A U.S. general expressed regret 
over the incident but said civilian deaths were ``unavoidable'' in 
war. The U.S. military said the soldiers, increasingly anxious about 
the danger of suicide attacks, opened fire Monday when the driver 
of the van failed to stop as ordered. A Washington Post reporter at 
the scene said 10 Iraqis in all were killed, including five young 
children. In the first moments after the shooting, a U.S. Army captain 
accused soldiers of not having fired warning shots quickly enough. 
The soldiers were from the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, which 
lost four soldiers Saturday at another checkpoint when an Iraqi soldier 
posing as a taxi driver detonated a car bomb in a suicide attack. 
In a similar incident, another Iraqi was killed at a checkpoint near 
the south-central town of Shatra, according to U.S. Navy Capt. Frank 
Thorp. Elsewhere, the U.S. Central Command said, an Iraqi prisoner 
was shot to death after he reached for a marine's weapon while being 
questioned. The fatal shooting of the seven women and children happened 
along Route 9 near Najaf, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of 
the site of Saturday's suicide bombing. At a briefing for reporters 
at Central Command headquarters in Qatar, U.S. Brig. Gen. Vincent 
Brooks said Tuesday that coalition forces had to maintain a state 
of heightened alert after the suicide attack that killed four Americans. 
``In all cases in checkpoints and otherwise we maintain the right 
to self-defense,'' Brooks said. ``We've increased vigilance because 
of the tactics of Iraqi death squads. ``While we regret the loss of 
civilian lives, they remain unavoidable,'' he said. Brooks said Iraqi 
forces had intentionally put women and children in danger in other 
incidents by using them as human shields and had even opened fire 
on Iraqi civilians trying to flee besieged towns and cities. ``The 
blood is on the hands of the regime. If there's a question of morality, 
it really should go back to the regime,'' he said. ``These are women 
and children and they're on the battlefield.'' Brooks also pointed 
out that U.S. and British soldiers in Iraq were getting help from 
some Iraqi civilians, citing instances were civilians revealed the 
locations of weapons caches and helped capture Iraqi soldiers. The 
Central Command said initial reports indicated the soldiers who opened 
fire on the civilian vehicle followed the rules of engagement to protect 
themselves. ``In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, 
the soldiers exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary 
loss of life,'' a Central Command statement said. However, it appeared 
the shooting could stoke opposition to the U.S.-led invasion among 
Iraqis in the Shiite Muslim region, where Washington had hoped for 
a popular uprising against Saddam. Instead, most Iraqi civilians have 
not openly backed the invasion, apparently waiting to see which way 
the war will go. According to an account from the Central Command, 
the van approached the military checkpoint Monday afternoon. Soldiers 
motioned for the driver to stop but were ignored. They then fired 
warning shots but the vehicle kept moving forward. Troops then shot 
into its engine. As a last resort, the military said, soldiers fired 
into the passenger side of the car. Two other civilians were wounded, 
according to the U.S. military, which said it is investigating the 
incident. ``They tried to warn the vehicle to stop; it did not stop,'' 
U.S. Marine Gen. Peter Pace told the American channel PBS television. 
``And it was unusual that that vehicle would be full of only women 
and that the driver was a woman. So we need to find out why it was 
that they were acting the way they did.'' The military statement said 
13 women and children were in the van. But The Washington Post, whose 
reporter is with the 3rd Infantry, said 15 people were in a four-wheel 
drive Toyota and 10 were killed, including five children who appeared 
to be under 5. One of the wounded was a man not expected to live, 
the Post reported on its Web site. In its description of the shooting, 
the Post quoted a 3rd Infantry Division captain as saying the checkpoint 
crew did not fire warning shots quickly enough. The Post described 
the captain watching through binoculars and ordering the soldiers 
by radio to fire a warning shot first and then shoot a machine-gun 
round into the vehicle's radiator. When the vehicle kept coming, the 
captain ordered, ``Stop him!'' About a dozen shots of 25mm cannon 
fire were heard from one or more of the platoon's Bradley fighting 
vehicles, the Post said. The captain then shouted over the radio at 
the platoon leader, ``You just [expletive] killed a family because 
you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough!'' according to the Post. 
``It was the most horrible thing I've ever seen, and I hope I never 
see it again,'' Sgt. Mario Manzano, 26, a medic, told the Post. U.S. 
officials offered the victims an unspecified amount of money as compensation. 
The European Union head office called the killing ``a horrible tragedy'' 
Tuesday, and urged forces on both sides of the war to spare civilian 
lives.

Fighting persisted in Chechnya Tuesday and a mine blast in a neighboring 
republic killed four Russian soldiers and wounded another, officials 
said. The violence came amid new efforts by pro-Moscow authorities 
to assure Chechens that stability is on the way, following approval 
of a new Kremlin-backed constitution. At least five Russian soldiers 
were killed and three wounded in rebel attacks in Chechnya over the 
past 24 hours, an official in the Moscow-backed administration said 
on condition of anonymity. Two Chechen police were also killed in 
the capital Grozny, the official said. In a separate incident, a Russian 
soldier driving an armored personnel career lost control of the vehicle 
near the village of Petropavlovsk, causing it to flip over, killing 
four soldiers and injuring four more. It was not clear what caused 
the driver to swerve. Russian aviation and artillery struck targets 
across Chechnya, while Russian troops rounded up at least 130 people 
on suspicion of rebel ties in Grozny and the Vedeno, Nozhai-Yurt and 
Shali regions. The so-called ``security sweeps'' have been widely 
criticized by human rights groups, who say they are rife with abuses 
including killings and torture. Across the border in Ingushetia, four 
Russian sappers were killed and another wounded by a mine, said Madina 
Teziyeva, a spokeswoman for the Ingush Interior Ministry. Their unit 
had been sweeping a road along the route of an army convoy near the 
Ingush capital Nazran, she said. Mine explosions are a common feature 
of the war in Chechnya, where rebels routinely lay explosive devices 
along the routes of military convoys. The mines claim daily casualties 
and force Russian troops to conduct painstaking sweeps ahead of any 
vehicles. Ingushetia has absorbed tens of thousands of refugees from 
the war in Chechnya, but has largely avoided spillover violence from 
the conflict next door. Also Tuesday, the head of the Moscow-backed 
Chechen administration, Akhmad Kadyrov, pledged that civilians would 
receive compensation within two years for property lost or damaged 
in the war. ``Payment of compensation within such a period is a very 
serious step for all of us,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him 
as saying. Kadyrov has been pledging to restore Chechnya's economy, 
following a recent referendum on a new constitution that firmly binds 
Chechnya to the Russian federal government. Election officials say 
nearly 96 percent of voters approved the document. Russian troops 
have fought two wars in Chechnya in the last decade. The first, in 
1994-96, ended with a Russian withdrawal, leaving the republic de 
facto independent. Russian troops returned in 1999 after rebel incursions 
into neighboring Dagestan and a series of apartment house bombings 
in Russia that were blamed on rebels. (pvs/yb/ee/jh)

Forward Dennis Rommedahl, who scored two goals in Denmark's 5-2 win 
against Romania, and defender Thomas Rytter said Tuesday they're ready 
to take on Bosnia-Herzegovina in this week's Euro 2004 qualifier. 
Group 2 leader Denmark, which beat Romania Saturday in Bucharest, 
plays Bosnia Wednesday in the capital, Copenhagen. It was good news 
for coach Morten Olsen whose team has been plagued by injuries. The 
1992 European Champions will meet Bosnia without veterans Thomas Helveg, 
Thomas Roel Larsen, Jesper Groenkjaer and Christian Poulsen, all of 
whom are injured. Martin Lauersen is out of the lineup, too, suspended 
after getting a second yellow card in Saturday's game. After Tuesday's 
training session, Rommedahl and Rytter said they were fit to fight. 
``I think it looks good,'' Rytter told Danish public radio. ``Time 
will tell whether I'll be in the lineup.'' The Wolfsburg defender 
played 34 minutes against Romania and left the sandy pitch with back 
and thigh pain. Rommedahl had a sore thigh muscle but was expected 
to recover by Wednesday. Denmark and Norway top Group 2 with seven 
points each, but the Danes lead on goal difference. Bosnia, which 
beat Luxembourg 2-0 on Saturday, is fourth with three points. Romania 
is third with six points while Luxembourg is last with no points.

Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an 
ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect behind the assassination 
of Serbia's prime minister. Police said in a statement that Milorad 
Lukovic, a former paramilitary commander and the leader of an underworld 
Belgrade clan, also is linked to other politically motivated killings 
during Milosevic's autocratic rule. Lukovic and his gang ``killed 
political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, 
Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement 
said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic and a fake 
Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name, which ``will speed up 
the arrest of that criminal.'' Lukovic has been on the run since the 
March 12 assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic by a sniper 
in downtown Belgrade. A special police unit under Lukovic's command 
until 2001 was suspected of having carried out Djindjic's killing 
as well as slaying former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic in August 
2000. The police statement came a day after authorities sought an 
international arrest warrant for Markovic, alleging she was involved 
in Stambolic's killing. She denounced the warrant in a message from 
Russia as a political ploy. Police said the investigation of Djindjic's 
killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy led by war criminals and 
war profiteers ... all from the ranks of Milosevic's regime.'' As 
president, Milosevic allowed underworld figures to fight alongside 
notorious paramilitary units in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, 
he gave them a free hand to join regular police forces, such as the 
special police unit linked to crime and drug trafficking rings, authorities 
said. Those ties continued even after the pro-democracy leadership 
took over in 2000. Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to 
the Netherlands-based U.N. war crimes tribunal. Later, Djindjic spearheaded 
efforts to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. 
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zarko Korac said Monday the warrant 
to be issued for Markovic's arrest was part of an effort by authorities 
to find those who ordered the killing of Stambolic. Authorities said 
there were ``credible suspicions'' of her involvement. Markovic became 
known as the ``red witch'' for the influence she wielded over Milosevic 
and his leftist Socialist Party. Stambolic, Serbia's president for 
a year in the late 1980s, was preparing to challenge Milosevic in 
national elections when he disappeared on Aug. 25, 2000, just two 
months before Milosevic was ousted. Serbian police last week discovered 
Stambolic's body during a crackdown on the paramilitary and underworld 
network accused of Djindjic's assassination. Markovic reportedly left 
for Russia in late February to join her son, Marko Milosevic, who 
fled Serbia following Milosevic's ouster. (ds/rp/cb)
