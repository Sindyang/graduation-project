David Beckham revealed Tuesday that he feels "insulted" by criticism 
of England's lacklustre recent performances and sprung to the defence 
of under-fire manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. Speaking on the eve of 
Wednesday's crucial Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey, Beckham admitted 
he had been hurt by suggestions the current England squad lacked the 
passion of their predecessors and dismayed by the widespread finger-pointing 
at the low-key style of their Swedish coach. "I'm the captain so I 
do feel personally insulted when people say the passion is not there," 
Beckham said. "I wouldn't say it affects me but it does annoy me." 
"Whether its on the manager's part or the players, I find it hard 
that the passion is being questioned within the team." Beckham insisted 
that Eriksson's dislike of the high-decibel "motivational" techniques 
traditionally employed in British football, should not be taken as 
a sign that he cares any less. "He might be different from other managers 
but to question his passion is wrong. He is a very passionate person 
and he is a very passionate manager." Eriksson, typically, seemed 
unperturbed about how he has come to be perceived and the criticism 
that goes with it. "I am like I am. To change character at my age 
would be very difficult and I've no intention of doing it." The Swede's 
cool, unexcitable style was initially hailed as one of the keys to 
his success in salvaging England's qualifying campaign for last summer's 
World Cup after he took over from Kevin Keegan. But after reaching 
the quarter-finals of last summer's World Cup, England have failed 
to reproduce anything like that early form and Eriksson now finds 
himself the subject of the kind of intense questioning of his abilities 
that forced Keegan out of the job. Beckham admitted he did recognise 
some parallels between the end of Keegan's reign and the current atmosphere 
surrounding England, but he insisted Eriksson was capable of proving 
his critics wrong and pleaded for him to be given a chance to do so. 
"I think what people should remember is that he has got great respect 
for people over here and I think that should be shown back," Beckham 
said. "He is doing a great job here to the best of his ability and 
he has got great ability as a manager and I think he should be appreciated 
for that. "If we go out and win this game it might be lifted for a 
short while but then when the next game comes up we have to do it 
again and again." Beckham was England's best player in their unconvincing 
2-0 win over Liechtenstein on Saturday, scoring one of his trademark 
freekicks. His performance is likely to be critical again on Wednesday, 
although it could be his defensive ability that counts more this time 
as he will have the task of shackling Inter Milan's Emre Belozoglu, 
the virtuoso element in Turkey's impressive midfield quartet. "He's 
obviously technically very good but we're not worrying about any individuals," 
Beckham said. "They've got very good technical players in midfield 
and they are very dangerous if we give them time. But it is up to 
not to give them time and beat them." Victory on Wednesday would lift 
England to a point above Turkey at the top of the group and make them 
favourites to clinch the one automatic qualifying spot for next summer's 
finals in Portugal. The runners-up in the group can still qualify 
through a play-off against another second-placed side. Beckham said 
a draw would keep England's chances of winning the group alive. "If 
we draw the game, of course we would not be happy but I think we are 
capable to going to Turkey and winning there." am/ak Fbl-Eur2004-ENG-TUR-Beckham

Oman's bourse soared Tuesday to a two-year high thanks largely to 
the perception of Gulf investors that the market is far removed from 
the war on Iraq, brokers said. Muscat Securities Market's MSM index, 
which was the main loser in the Gulf in 2001 and closed 2002 at 191.86 
points, finished on 207.57 points. "Oman remains safe and stable despite 
the war and will attract stock market players," said Ayman Jubeh, 
brokerage manager of BankMuscat. "Investors from Bahrain, Kuwait and 
the United Arab Emirates are preferring Oman in the present situation," 
he told AFP. Jubeh forecast continuing interest in stocks after positive 
2002 annual reports from many listed companies. The MSM index reached 
an all-time high of 508 points in 1998 before a massive correction 
saw it slump to a record low of 152.08 points by end-2001. The Omani 
bourse has a market capitalisation of around four billion dollars. 
Many stock exchanges in the Middle East are steadily rising despite 
the conflict in Iraq, betting on a strong post-war recovery. Even 
Kuwait's, next door to the war, closed at a new all-time high on Sunday.

Around 100 Iraqi tribesmen have fought alongside US troops in central 
Iraq and more are expected to join the battle against the regime of 
Saddam Hussein, a US military spokesman said Tuesday. General Vincent 
Brooks said the local militias joined an attack with troops from the 
First Marine Expeditionary Force near the towns of Diwaniyah and Shatra, 
south of Baghdad. "We've operated in a variety of areas and in close 
contact with tribal leaders and tribal members. Where we can find 
an access point or find someone who is interested in contacting us, 
we will pursue that," he said. "We think we're going to see a whole 
lot more of those (tribal forces) in the coming days as they continue 
to show up ... As the regime is pushed back, peeled back or destroyed, 
people will start seeking freedom for themselves." The general told 
reporters at the coalition military headquarters here that coalition 
troops were receiving more and more assistance from ordinary Iraqis 
despite growing civilian casualties in the war. In the north, American 
soldiers have been cooperating with local Kurdish fighters to coordinate 
ground and air attacks against Iraqi positions and alleged terrorist 
bases. US special forces troops and CIA agents reportedly roamed the 
countryside of Afghanistan with suitcases full of money to buy the 
allegiances of warlords ahead of the attack on the Taliban regime 
there in 2001. Local tribesmen are still playing a central role in 
Afghanistan as US troops hunt down the remnants of the Taliban and 
the al-Qaeda terrorist network. smc/mb Iraq-war-US-tribal

Municipal elections are to take place throughout Spain on May 25, 
along with elections to the governing assemblies in 13 of the country's 
17 regions, officials said on Tuesday. Catalonia, Galicia, Andalusia 
and the Basque Region, which have more autonomy than Spain's 13 other 
regions, are to hold their regional elections on different dates, 
that have not yet been announced. About 34.4 million Spaniards, plus 
some 500,000 nationals of other European Union countries resident 
in Spain, are eligible to vote in the local elections. An estimated 
18.5 million will be voting in the regional poll. mnv/do/iih/ds Spain-vote

KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (AFP) - US troops fired at a Kuwaiti soldier's 
car Tuesday as he tried to take a short cut through an American military 
camp in northern Kuwait, Kuwaiti officials and US military sources 
said. "The soldier tried to take a short cut ... Gunfire at the site 
was unintentional, but due to the situation in the region, precautions 
must be taken in dealing with any suspicious situation," Kuwaiti army 
spokesman Colonel Yussif al-Mulla told the official KUNA news agency. 
A US military source said that two cars had driven at speed towards 
Camp Thunder, near the Iraqi border, in the early hours. "Two vehicles 
were racing towards the camp. One got caught up in the barbed wire 
perimeter. The other sped away," the source told AFP. "There is some 
indication that the forces did fire at one or both of the vehicles." 
The source did not know if anyone had been detained or hurt in the 
incident. US forces in the region have been on a heightened state 
of alert following a suicide car bombing near Najaf in Iraq on Saturday 
that killed four soldiers. Seven women and children were killed Monday 
when US soldiers opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military checkpoint 
at Najaf. On Sunday, US soldiers shot an Egyptian electrician who 
rammed his truck into soldiers at another US military camp in northern 
Kuwait, injuring 15 people. The driver was left in critical condition. 
Tens of thousands of US troops are based in the deserts of northern 
Kuwait which has been the launchpad of the US-led campaign to topple 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. co/hc Iraq-war-US-Kuwait

Defense sources in Monrovia said Tuesday that government troops were 
"making progress" in the battle to regain control of the northeastern 
town of Ganta, overrun by rebel forces at the weekend. Liberian President 
Charles Taylor's private Kiss FM radio, quoting Defense Minister Daniel 
Chea, said "government troops have encircled rebel forces and were 
waiting for them to run out of ammunition to launch a final assault 
on them." The government had said in a statement at the weekend that 
rebels who attacked Ganta were remnants of a contingent of Liberians 
United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) troops who had been 
repelled from the central city of Gbarnga, near Ganta and about 160 
kilometers (96 miles) north of Monrovia. "Government troops attacked 
the rebels from two fronts with the assistance of traditional hunters 
using single-barrel shotguns," Chea said. But LURD has denied losing 
Gbarnga to government forces, in a press statement published in the 
independent Analyst newspaper. The rebel group also said in the statement 
that it has forces in several locations throughout Liberia, including 
Combat Camp, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Monrovia; 
Klay, 45 kilometers (27 miles) outside the capital, the port city 
Robertsport, and the towns of Zorzor, Voinjama and Kolahun in northern 
Lofa County. LURD launched its insurgency against Taylor from Lofa 
County in 1999. The Liberian government has alleged that the rebels 
are backed by Guinea, which Monrovia has accused of providing LURD 
with rear bases. More than 14,000 Liberians have since late last week 
crossed the border into Guinea, Liberia's northern neighbour, fleeing 
fighting between government troops and rebels in their own country, 
according to UN relief workers. Last week, more than 30,000 people 
were trapped inside Liberia along some 50 kilometres (30 miles) of 
border territory, between the towns of Ganta and Sanniquellie, UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees staff said. Refugees have told aid 
workers that they were on the move because of clashes in the Ganta 
area. Last week, the Liberian government said it had seized the country's 
second city, Gbarnga, east of Ganta, back from the rebels. LURD has, 
meanwhile, denied any involvement in the fighting in southeastern 
city of Grand Gedeh, home of former Liberian president Samuel Doe, 
or in Toe or Zwedru, near the eastern border with Ivory Coast. Four 
WFP workers, all Liberians, were among a group of humanitarian workers 
kidnapped last Thursday by armed men in Zwedru. Three of them have 
been released, but the whereabouts of the fourth are still unknown. 
Two Liberians and one Norwegian working for the US-based Adventist 
Relief and Development Agency (ADRA) were found dead around a week 
after they went missing during fighting in Toe on February 28. Monrovia 
claimed the three ADRA workers had died in a LURD ambush, but the 
rebels immediately rejected the accusation, saying they did not even 
operate in southeastern Liberia. In its latest statement, LURD repeated 
that it "is not operating in Grand Gedeh, Toe Town and Zwedru." "LURD 
is not a consortium for any group fighting alongside the government 
of Liberia and insurgents fighting alongside the government of Cote 
d'Ivoire," Ivory Coast's French name, the statement said. LURD has 
been waging a three-year war against Taylor, himself a former warlord 
who came to power in 1997 after a brutal seven-year civil war. tas/kdz/nb

Consumers, glued to television for the opening shots of the Iraq war, 
sent sales into a slump at major US retail chain stores last week, 
an industry report said Tuesday. A barometer of sales by retail chain 
stores drawn up by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg tumbled 
1.4 percent in the week ending March 29, the steepest fall since December 
last year. "The 'CNN effect', which is the tendency for potential 
shoppers to stay home and watch the war coverage on television, was 
seemingly instrumental in restraining sales," the survey said. The 
Iraq war appeared to have a bigger initial impact on chain store sales 
than in the comparable period of the Gulf War, it said. Sales were 
generally below expectations, the survey said. Some reports also suggested 
that stores near US borders suffered as fewer people crossed into 
the United States to shop. Over February, sales were up 0.8 percent 
from the same period a year earlier despite harsh weather and the 
war,according to the tally of 82 retail chain stores. Sales at chain 
stores in March were expected to be between flat and down 1.0 percent, 
partly because of the later arrival of Easter, which lands April 20 
this year compared to March 31 last year. "The war effect on monthly 
sales is likely to depress sales as well, but only modestly -- most 
likely no more than 0.5 percentage points -- since we believe much 
of that effect already has been depressing sales," it said. Government 
figures last week showed consumer spending, when adjusted for inflation, 
fell 0.4 percent in February, the steepest fall since September 2002. 
Fears of an Iraq war, combined with snowstorms and mass job cuts also 
sent February retail sales sliding 1.6 percent, the steepest dive 
since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, government figures 
showed. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic activity. 
US consumer confidence, already at a near 10-year low, crumbled again 
in March in the run-up to the Iraqi war, a survey by the private research 
group Conference Board showed a week ago. djw/jsl US-economy-retail

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Vice President Dick Cheney has indefinitely 
postponed an April trip that would have taken him to China, Japan, 
South Korea and Australia, in order to devote his full attention to 
the war against Iraq. "This is not the right time" for the voyage, 
said Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise, who did not confirm the 
countries the vice president was to visit in addition to a long stay 
in China. The spokeswoman did not mention a new target date for the 
trip, which was announced last October. "It's an important region, 
and we believe it's a trip we should do at a time that allows for 
it," said Millerwise, who noted that US President George W. Bush in 
January cancelled a trip to Africa for "the very same reason." Cheney 
would have travelled to Japan, South Korea, as well as Australia -- 
which has contributed combat troops to the US-led war effort Iraq 
-- according to administration officials who declined to be named. 
The spokeswoman did not cite the spreading outbreak of a deadly pneumonia, 
known as SARS, in the region which last week prompted the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to warn 
Americans to postpone non-essential trips to Asia. The virus claimed 
another death on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong man succumbing 
to the disease. Severe Accute Respiratory Syndrome has now killed 
34 people in China, 16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, 
four in Singapore and one in Thailand. ok/mac US-China-Cheney-postpone

Aid staff are working round the clock to try to get supplies of drinking 
water to the Iraqi people and equip hospitals to care for the sick 
and wounded, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said 
on Tuesday. The ICRC, which has more than 100 staff on the ground 
including 14 expatriate workers spread between Baghdad, Basra and 
Arbil is deeply concerned about the fate of Iraqi civilians, spokeswoman 
Antonella Notari said. As Baghdad continues to face nightly bombardments 
by coalition forces the priority for ICRC staff in the capital is 
to get out into the city's hospitals to evaluate the medical needs 
on the ground, she said. "They visit hospitals every day during the 
quiet times, notably those that have surgery facilities for the war 
injured," she told reporters. Hospitals have received equipment and 
basic medicines, as well as generators, in some cases, to ensure they 
can continue surgical operations in the event of power cuts. "For 
the time being the situation in the supply of water is under control" 
in Baghdad, Notari said. Water, on the other hand, is the "big priority" 
in Iraq's second city of Basra in the south of the country. Having 
already managed to get drinking water supplies resumed to about half 
the people who rely on the region's main water pumping station, ICRC 
teams are now trying to boost its capacity for the rest of the two 
million users. The medical team in Basra has been reinforced in recent 
days, and after visits to three hospitals, Notari said the hospitals 
were managing to cope. "Medical staff and stocks that we put in place 
before the start of the conflict have enabled the situation to be 
dealt with," Notari said. Around the northern city of Arbil, ICRC 
helped about 1,000 people who had fled from Kirkuk and Mosul several 
seeks ago and unlike most of the displaced were unable to find shelter 
with family and friends. "There is a continued dialogue with the authorities 
on both sides, the military commanders," Notari told reporters. "We 
reserve the right to discuss with them what seems necessary to us 
in terms of the protection of the civilian population," she added, 
stressing the talks remained confidential. The UN's World Food Programme 
(WFP) believes that the Iraqi people have enough food to see them 
through until the end of April, spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume 
said on Tuesday. WFP hopes to return to Iraq to reactivate a food 
distribution system, already in place under the UN's oil-for-food 
programme, and comprising about 50,000 distribution points. "We think 
that it is feasible provided we have security and the necessary resources," 
Berthiaume told reporters. The Rome-based UN agency has received 115 
million dollars so far out of the 1.3 billion it appealed for on Friday. 
WFP is currently looking into the possibility of the setting up of 
humanitarian corridors to help bring in the planned 480,000 tonnes 
of food a month, she said. "The fate of civilians, their health and 
their safety, deeply concerns us," Notari of the ICRC said. "It is 
the responsibility of the belligerents to ensure the security and 
health of civilians so that they are not cut off from vital supplies 
and that they are not attacked," Notari added. kjm-jlv/jfs Iraq-war-aid-ICRC

The head of Iraq's main Shiite Muslim opposition group said here Tuesday 
the United States was having difficulties in its war on Iraq because 
it had refused to let the Iraqi opposition take part in operations. 
But Mohammed Baqer Hakim, head of the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly 
for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI), said talks between his 
group and Washington on a post-war Iraq were continuing. "Since the 
beginning, we advised the Americans to cooperate with opposition groups 
but they insisted on launching the operation alone, that's why they 
have so many problems on the ground today," Hakim told AFP. "The Americans, 
who have a limited knowledge of Iraq and Iraqis, fell into the trap 
of the Iraqi regime, that has succeeded in leading them into towns 
and populated areas, which has raised the number of civilian casualties," 
he said. SAIRI's armed wing, the Badr Brigade, has a trained fighting 
force estimated to number between 10,000 and 15,000 men, according 
to diplomatic sources. On Friday, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 
accused Iran of allowing hundreds of them to cross into Iraq against 
US wishes, and said he would hold Iran responsible. "We are neutral 
in this war but our discussions with the Americans continue," Hakim 
said, adding his group had told the United States to "limit civilian 
losses and avoid attacking the population." "We are also discussing 
with the Americans post-Saddam, stressing the role that must be played 
by the Iraqi opposition in the transitional regime," he added. "The 
Badr Brigade forces are Iraqi and independent and have nothing to 
do with (Iran's) Revolutionary Guards, and that includes brigade forces 
based in Iran," Hakim said. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi 
has also dismissed Rumsfeld's charges, insisting that the SAIRI was 
"completely independent and has nothing to do with the Islamic republic." 
Hakim, who has been in exile in Iran for more than 20 years, said 
he would "return to Iraq at an opportune moment, I don't know when 
exactly." SAIRI's London representative, Hamed al-Bayati, said on 
March 26 his group -- which has ties to Iraq's Shiite majority -- 
had opted for "neutrality" in the conflict because it did not want 
civilians to get involved in a "bruising battle between the allies 
and the regime." sgh/lal/srj/mb Iraq-war-opposition-Shiites

When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered his on-camera advice on 
military strategy and tactics to senior army officers, Pentagon planners 
may not have taken him too seriously. On the 13th day of a vicious 
war, they may regret not having listened more closely. In between 
remarks on the troops' personal hygiene or endurance capacity, the 
Iraqi leader said on more than one occasion that he planned to let 
US and British forces have their way in desert regions before dragging 
them into urban warfare, chiefly in Baghdad. "The enemy will land 
in remote regions and film it," Saddam said in late January during 
one of his daily meetings with military aides. The "enemy media will 
then start saying that they are at some distance from Ramadi (west 
of Baghdad) or somewhere else and now on their way to invade this 
or that city. "This is how they are going to put on their show," he 
said. "The enemy will not enter Baghdad's suburbs because he will 
die. Even if they send a million soldiers, our boys will kill them," 
Saddam added at the time. US President George W. Bush says US and 
British forces closing in on Baghdad every day. But the allied troops 
appear to be marching in place in the desert without taking any of 
Iraq's major cities. Criticism of the military campaign has begun 
to surface in the US media, targeting in particular Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld, who is being accused of rejecting advice from military 
commanders to use substantially more troops and armor. The need to 
deploy more troops on the ground is being felt especially because 
of the allied forces' apparent inability to break the regime's hold 
on major cities despite intensive air bombardment, particularly of 
the Iraqi capital. An additional 120,000 US troops are due to pour 
into Iraq within weeks, joining the 90,000 who began the ground war. 
It is a scenario Saddam forecast publicly in the course of a "chat" 
with the military top brass. "Anyone seeking to occupy a land must 
deploy soldiers on this land. Without deploying ground troops, the 
enemy will be able to destroy and inflict damage, but not to occupy 
the land," he said. "I say this on television knowing the Americans 
are listening," Saddam added. "We warn them against any illusion that 
Iraq will be an easy prey. They can hurt us, but do they realize the 
scale of the damage they will suffer?" he warned. Echoing his boss, 
Iraq's number two Ezzat Ibrahim on Sunday downplayed the allied forces' 
advances on the ground, vowing that Iraqi fighters would surround 
them and force them to "flee to the empty desert." "What will determine 
the outcome of the battle is the price the enemies pay in losses of 
men and equipment, not the fact that they control an inch here or 
there in Iraq," he told a meeting of high-ranking officials from the 
ruling Baath Party. "Therefore our fighters must minimize losses in 
their ranks and inflict as heavy casualties as possible on the American 
and British forces of aggression," Ibrahim said. The Baath Party mouthpiece 
Ath-Thawra Tuesday scoffed at US miscalculations. "The Pentagon is 
blaming the CIA for feeding it wrong information that hastened the 
launching of the war while the stupid CIA is denouncing the lack of 
preparation and equipment," the paper wrote. "As for the generals, 
they are denouncing Rumsfeld's dictatorial behavior and his refusal 
to heed their advice to put off military action," it said. The CIA 
"fiasco" must be attributed to its reliance on information provided 
by "a small group of traitors and agents," Ath-Thawra said in a reference 
to the US-backed exiled Iraqi opposition. Al-Iraq, another official 
daily, also offered Rumsfeld advice. It said he could extricate himself 
in only one of two ways -- by "committing suicide or resigning." ezz/lg/sct/hc

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US President George W Bush has complete 
confidence in Donald Rumsfeld, White House officials said Tuesday 
in the face of continuing criticism over the defence secretary's handling 
of the US military campaign in Iraq. "The president has tremendous 
faith in secretary Rumsfeld and his generals, secretary Rumsfeld's 
leadership, secretary Rumsfeld's decisions and that's borne out by 
what the president views as a successful military campaign," a White 
House official said on condition of anonymity. The New York Times 
kept the heat on Rumsfeld Tuesday, publishing several articles on 
accusations from senior military officers that he has interfered to 
limit the number of battlefield troops in Iraq. Reporting from the 
US V Corps headquarters near the Kuwait-Iraq border, the paper referred 
to "long-simmering tensions" which have "erupted in a series of complaints 
from officers on the Iraqi battlefield that the Pentagon has not sent 
enough troops to wage the war as they want to fight it." "Raw nerves 
were obvious as officers compared Mr Rumsfeld to Robert McNamara, 
an architect of the Vietnam war who failed to grasp the political 
and military realities of Vietnam," the paper said. jld/jsl/mac Iraq-war-US-Bush-Rumsfeld

European Development and Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Poul Nielson 
warned Tuesday against involving US and British troops in the distribution 
of emergency humanitarian aid to Iraqis. In an interview with the 
Danish daily Politiken, Nielson said the United States and Britain 
have been keen to show that their troops are in Iraq to help the Iraqi 
people, but that involving them in humanitarian aid could do more 
harm than good. Images of heavily armed US and British troops handing 
out food and water to hungry Iraqis have been cabled out around the 
world. "To let soldiers distribute emergency aid puts in danger all 
those who are normally involved in impartial humanitarian aid. The 
role of neutral aid workers is weakened by this interference, because 
it will be difficult for them to approach people in need," he said. 
"People should be able to seek out the aid they need from humanitarian 
organisations and not from an occupying power," said Nielson, who 
is currently in Africa. sa/po/ns Iraq-war-EU-US-Britain-aid

Australian star Harry Kewell's future at Leeds United appeared in 
doubt Tuesday after the English Premiership club announced debts of 
80 million pounds (120 million dollars) when they parted company with 
under-fire chairman Peter Ridsdale. Ridsdale had been reported ready 
to offer Kewell over two million pounds (3.5 million dollars) a season 
for four years. But it was not known how new chairman John McKenzie 
viewed the situation. McKenzie said Monday the club, which sacked 
Terry Venables 10 days ago after the club had slumped to 16th in the 
Premiership, faced a challenge of avoiding relegation and balancing 
the books. One easy way would be to off-load Kewell, whose current 
deal expires at the end of next season, in the summer. The Australian 
was rated an 8.5 million pound (13 million dollar) buy. "What happens 
from here is not something that I can comment on," his manager Bernie 
Mandic said. rw/ea03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-AUS-Kewell

The top Turkmen election official on Tuesday insisted that a series 
of weekend elections would prove the democratic credentials of the 
isolated and repressive Central Asian state. "There is not one neighbourhood 
lacking alternative candidates for voters to choose from -- this demonstrates 
that pre-election campaigning has occurred on competitive democratic 
principles," Murat Karyev, chairman of the central election commission 
told AFP. Voting on Sunday will be for a national people's assembly 
of 65 people and for 5,535 local councils, as well as four parliamentary 
by-elections, the election commission said. Ex-Soviet Turkmenistan 
has been condemned most recently by the pan-European rights body the 
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which 
accused it of "mind-boggling" human rights abuses in a report published 
in March. The people's assembly usually meets annually to issue guidance 
on the overall direction of government policy, rather than to pass 
legislation. Elections to parliament, which is tasked with passing 
legislation, are due next year. The election comes as President Saparmurat 
Niyazov attempts to improve his image following international criticism 
of a wave of repressive measures which followed an alleged assasination 
attempt against him last November. "The contrast between the law as 
it is presented and the reality marked by terror and fear is mind-boggling" 
said the OSCE report, which questioned whether an assasination attempt 
had actually taken place and the subsequent conviction of 62 people 
including several former ministers. Turkmenistan has prevented the 
OSCE from observing previous elections and the pan-European body's 
Ashkhabad office declined to say whether it would be monitoring Sunday's 
election. Turkmenistan's electorate numbers some 2.2 million people 
out of a population of 4.7 million. str/njc/hm/jfs Turkmenistan-vote

US troops kill seven women, children in setback to hearts and minds 
campaign by Lachlan Carmichael ATTENTION - REPETITION ADDING headline/// 
NEAR NAJAF, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and 
children when they opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military 
checkpoint, in a severe blow for coalition efforts to win the trust 
of the Iraqi people. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned 
by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, US spokesman 
Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims 
were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite hand signals and repeated 
warning shots fired by US troops, who then fired at the passenger 
compartment as a last resort. Citing officers on the scene, the Washington 
Post said the civilians were killed by 25mm gunfire, with one man 
-- apparently the driver -- so badly injured he was not expected to 
live. US forces in Iraq have been on a heightened state of alert and 
are approaching Iraqi civilians with much greater caution following 
a suicide car bombing near Najaf on Saturday that killed four soldiers. 
Well before Saturday's car bomb, US officers had been making no secret 
of their outrage at the guerrilla tactics they said had been practiced 
by Iraqi forces -- firing from civilian vehicles, faking surrenders 
only to open fire, fighting behind human shields. Troops on the ground 
have also been frustrated -- and surprised -- by Iraqi forces they 
say don civilian clothes and then melt into the general population, 
making it near impossible to distinguish friend from foe. Reacting 
to Monday's shooting, Major General Buford Blount, commander of Third 
Infantry Division, said Tuesday his troops were "very concerned about 
it and very sorry that it happened." But he stressed that with US 
soldiers on edge after the suicide car bomb attack, the unit that 
opened fire on the minibus had respected its rules of engagement. 
A written statement issued by US Central Command here early Tuesday 
said initial reports of the checkpoint shooting "indicate the soldiers 
responded in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves". 
"In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers 
exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of 
life." Central Command spokesman James Wilkinson later described the 
shooting as an "unfortunate tragedy" and acknowledged that young US 
soldiers could well be "a little jumpy" in the aftermath of the suicide 
bombing. "While it is a tragedy and we certainly grieve for the loss 
of the innocent," he told a BBC interviewer, "it does point out the 
tactics that this regime is going to use. "In instances like this, 
the fault lies with the regime." US Brigadier General Vincent Brooks 
told a press briefing Tuesday at Central Command's forward planning 
base in Qatar, "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they 
remain unavoidable as they have been throughout history." "Our efforts 
may result in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result 
in the loss of Iraqi military lives," he also said when asked if the 
checkpoint shooting would affect the coalition's efforts to win "the 
hearts and minds" of the people of Iraq. As civilian casualties mount 
in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day and night 
air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was a further blow to a US public 
relations campaign that seeks to portray coalition troops as liberators 
and providers rather than invaders and occupiers. US newspapers warned 
of the negative fallout from the killings on public opinion in Iraq 
as well as the Middle East at large, and said such incidents play 
into the hands of President Saddam Hussein's regime. The balancing 
act for military commanders to minimize civilian casualties while 
putting down Iraqi resistance is "clearly growing harder," the Washington 
Post said. "Even if accidental, such events, like the deaths of civilians 
in Baghdad attributed to errant US bombs, can incur large political 
costs both in and outside Iraq," the Post said. The New York Times 
said that "billions around the globe are seeing and hearing reports 
that women and children were gunned down yesterday ... "This is just 
what the Iraqi commanders have in mind when they send soldiers disguised 
as non-combatants to fire on unsuspecting American troops," the paper 
said. "If such scenes become routine ... , the political war for Iraq 
could be lost even before the military one is won," warned the Times. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), meanwhile, said 
it regretted the shooting and hoped US troops made sure that the driver 
of the minibus, had been adequately warned. "We hope that they took 
all the necessary measures to warn the people, to clearly alert them," 
Antonella Notari, an ICRC spokeswoman in Geneva, told reporters. "Checkpoints 
have, of course, the right to try and defend their own security and 
the security of their personnel so they may search vans, they may 
stop vehicles, there are certain rules on how you proceed in that," 
she said. "I can't comment on what exactly happened on the spot, I 
can only deeply regret that again they were civilians who were hit," 
she added. nh-lc/bur/hc/mb Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US President George W Bush has complete 
confidence in Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, White House officials 
said Tuesday in the face of criticism of Rumsfeld's handling of the 
US military campaign in Iraq. "The president has tremendous faith 
in secretary Rumsfeld and his generals, secretary Rumsfeld's leadership, 
secretary Rumsfeld's decisions and that's borne out by what the president 
views as a successful military campaign," a White House official said 
on condition of anonymity. Divisions between military and civilian 
commanders over the size of the force in Iraq and the war strategy 
have become apparent in a series of articles in the US media over 
the past week. The New York Times kept the heat on Rumsfeld Tuesday, 
publishing articles on accusations from senior military officers that 
he has interfered to limit the number of battlefield troops in Iraq. 
Reporting from the US V Corps headquarters near the Kuwait-Iraq border, 
the paper referred to "long-simmering tensions" which have "erupted 
in a series of complaints from officers on the Iraqi battlefield that 
the Pentagon has not sent enough troops to wage the war as they want 
to fight it." "Raw nerves were obvious as officers compared Mr Rumsfeld 
to Robert McNamara, an architect of the Vietnam war who failed to 
grasp the political and military realities of Vietnam," the paper 
said. jld/jsl/tw Iraq-war-US-Bush-Rumsfeld

Serious disruption can be expected to the Paris transport system Thursday 
as a result of a national strike by unions over pension reform, the 
city's transport authority RATP said. Metro, bus and tramway services 
in the capital will be severely cut, as well as RER commuter trains, 
it said. The strike at RATP will begin at 3:00 am (01H00) and end 
on Friday at 6:30 am (0430 GMT), the CGT union said. Unions representing 
flight-controllers and ground staff at airports are also calling on 
members to join Thursday's day of action, and the civil aviation authority 
(DGAC) was due to announce a reduced programme of national and internatiponal 
flights. Around 85 demonstrations are planned around the country Thursday 
to put pressure on the centre-right government as it formulates proposals 
for reforming the country's pension system. bur/hs/ns France-transport-strike

A South African man who was part of a group of human shields in Iraq 
spoke Tuesday of how a potentially fatal encounter with a team of 
coalition soldiers was saved by a cricket discussion. Abie Dawjee 
said 20 South Africa human shields were on a bus driving from Baghdad 
toward the Jordanian border when they saw four tanks parked across 
the highway. "There were soldiers lying on the ground in a firing 
position, with their guns pointed towards the bus," said Dawjee. "Our 
driver stopped near to the tanks and a soldier ordered us to get out. 
It was terrifying because earlier some motorists had told us that 
American forces were opening fire on vehicles on the highway. "When 
we got out they kept their guns pointed at us, but then we heard their 
accents -- they were Aussies (Australians). We told them we were South 
Africans and we started to talk about the Cricket World Cup. "That 
broke the ice and eventually after some negotiations they let us through 
so that we could go home." srg/hn/kdz Iraq-war-SAfrica-Australia-shields-cricket

NEW YORK, April 1 (AFP) - US stocks drifted higher in opening trade 
Tuesday after a series of selloffs, but traders remained cautious 
about developments in the Iraq war. The Dow Jones industrials average 
rose 31.19 points (0.38 percent) to 8,023.32 in the first trades. 
The broader Standard and Poor's 500 index added 3.02 points or 0.35 
percent to 851.20. The technology-laden Nasdaq index advanced 6.20 
points or 0.45 percent to 1,347.37. "We have a bit of a bounce," said 
Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Global Partners Securities. "It's 
a bit on the technical side ... But (the market) is all war-driven 
and we're going to be very tied to news out of Iraq." On Monday, the 
Dow slumped 153.64 points or 1.89 percent to 7,992.13, the first finish

Jordanian authorities have foiled two Iraqi plots to attack US interests 
in its western neighbour, including a bid to poison the water supply 
of US troops and an attempted bombing of a luxury hotel, diplomatic 
sources said Tuesday. The first conspiracy was the reason for the 
expulsion of three Iraqi diplomats late last month, while the second 
led to the arrest of four other Iraqis last week, the sources said. 
The bomb plot involved the Hyatt Amman Hotel, where nearly 70 foreign 
journalists are staying. A large contingent of US nationals has also 
taken up residence in two adjacent tower blocks for as yet unexplained 
reasons. "Four Iraqis were arrested in Amman last week for their involvement 
in an attempt to blow up the Hyatt Amman Hotel", one of the sources 
told AFP, asking not to be identified. The four were not diplomats 
and enjoyed no immunity, he added. A fire broke out on the ninth floor 
of the hotel last week, prompting rumours of an attempted bombing. 
But hotel staff questioned by AFP insisted that the blaze, which was 
rapidly brought under control, was the result of an electrical short 
circuit. There was no immediate confirmation that the fire was the 
incident which prompted the four arrests. The poisoning plot involved 
water mains serving Jordanian military bases close to the Iraqi border 
where US troops are based, the diplomatic sources said. "The Iraqi 
diplomats expelled on March 23 were conspiring to poison water mains 
serving the east of Jordan," where most of the US forces deployed 
in the kingdom are based, one of the sources told AFP, declining to 
be identified. Publicly, officials insist there are just a few hundred 
US service personnel here, playing no direct role in the fighting 
in neighbouring Iraq, but diplomatic sources say that in reality the 
number is more like 6,000. The sources did not elaborate on the nature 
of the poison said to have been involved in the plot. Jordanian Information 
Minister Mohamed Adwan told AFP, "This is a security matter, attempts 
to undermine Jordan security, being investigated and I cannot discuss 
it further". Jordan originally expelled five embassy staff but later 
lifted the expulsion order against two of them. King Abdullah II also 
made clear the following day that Jordan was ready to allow Iraq to 
name replacements for those kicked out. Jordanian officials have so 
far refused to spell out the reasons for the expulsion orders against 
the diplomats, saying only that they were issued for security reasons.. 
But last week Foreign Minister Marwan Moasher threatened to reveal 
the details if Iraq persisted in accusing Jordan of bending to US 
pressure. "The issue of the three (expelled) Iraqi diplomats is purely 
a security one and we did not choose to divulge details on it in because 
we are not interested in a public debate or an uproar with Iraq," 
Moasher said. "If the Iraqis wish to further provoke this issue and 
to paint it as an answer to an American request, we will divulge these 
details." Iraqi officials have since taken a more conciliatory line, 
waxing lyrical about the strength of ties between the two countries. 
"Jordanian-Iraqi relations are like a stream of friendship and have 
a deep historical depth to them and what happened is nothing but a 
passing cloud," ambassador Sabah Yassin told Jordan's official Petra 
news agency, adding that Baghdad was ready to replace the three expelled 
diplomats. rh/kir/mb Iraq-war-Jordan Iraq-war-Jordan

US-British bombing kills 33 civilians south of Baghdad: hospital = 
(PICTURES) = ATTENTION - ADDS cluster bombs used, details /// HILLA, 
Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - Thirty-three civilians, including children, 
were killed and 310 wounded in a US-British coalition bombing on the 
southern province of Babylon on Tuesday morning, a hospital director 
said. Murtada Abbas said the bombing targeted the Nader residential 
area at the southern outskirts of the farming town of Hilla, 80 kilometres 
(50 miles) south of Baghdad. He was speaking at the Hilla hospital 
where a large number of children lay wounded under blankets on the 
floor due to a shortage of beds. At the scene of the bombing, dozens 
of what seemed to be parts of cluster bombs equipped with small parachutes 
were peppered over a large area, an AFP correspondent at the site 
said. Iraqi army soldiers were seen collecting the bomb pieces, which 
witnesses said coalition warplanes had dropped over the neighborhood. 
The soldiers poured fuel on the bombs before setting them on fire 
to explode the ordnance. Dozens of homes were destroyed in the bombing 
that also killed donkeys and chickens, the correspondent said. ks-nay/sct/hc

Iraqi forces prevented British forces from landing near the strategic 
city of Mosul in northern Iraq, and killed many of the troops, Information 
Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf said here Tuesday. "The British force 
which had been dropped there has been eliminated mostly. Only a few 
managed to flee by helicopter," Sahhaf said in his daily briefing 
to reporters on the war. The minister also said 18 people were killed 
and more than 100 wounded in British and US air strikes on Baghdad 
since Monday evening, but painted a very different picture from US 
officials on battles raging in the south. He said the British landing 
took place in the Baaj district west of Mosul. He did not say when 
it happened, and there has been no confirmation from British sources. 
Mosul, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) north of Baghdad, has been 
the target of repeated coalition air strikes as Britain and the United 
States attempt to soften its defences ahead of the long-awaited opening 
of a second front in the north. He said the Iraqi fighters, included 
the paramilitary Saddam's Fedayeen militia, which attacked the British 
landing captured "most of their equipment, their weapons, their armoured 
cars and vehicles." "It is a complete defeat for the first military 
drop in the north. And amazingly, the Americans had pushed the British 
to do that, as if it was an experiment to be implemented on the British 
to see what are the results. "The results were very tragic for the 
British," he said, without saying exactly how many British soldiers 
were killed. Asked about the reported clash, British spokeswoman Lieutenant 
Commander Emma Thomas said at the coalition base in Qatar, "We're 
investigating it but we do not have anything that we can comment on 
at the moment." The Arabic satellite news channel Al-Jazeera for its 
part reported the landing took place overnight Sunday. On Tuesday, 
it broadcast images of locals parading weapons and ammunition, as 
well as military vehicles, apparently belonging to British forces. 
Some 1,000 troops from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade have parachuted 
into Kurdish-held territory in the northern Iraq, while another 1,000 
special forces have been deployed in the region. Sahhaf also said 
that "fierce battles" had taekn place between British troops and Iraqi 
forces in the southern town of Abu al-Khasib, near the country's second 
city of Basra. "They inflicted high casualties on the British troops 
there and the corpses of the enemy are still there on the battleground," 
he said. However, reports from the scene said the last Iraqi resistance 
had been wiped out in Abu al-Khasib and that the British troops were 
being welcomed by some residents. And Thomas said that the last report 
received in Qatar indicated that 19 British troops were injured when 
they seized control of the town in recent days. "It's over now ... 
Unless there's some action that's just happened I'm not sure what 
he (Sahhaf) is referring to," she said. The British attacked outlying 
areas of Basra on Monday but were awaiting reinforcements before any 
drive into the town centre, which has been defended by paramilitary 
forces fiercely loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The minster 
also said that Iraqi forces had downed a US helicopter on the outskirts 
of Basra. US troops were "confronted by a mechanized Iraqi unit, then 
the American column retreated. Then the Iraqi side shot down one helicopter," 
he said. He said there was more heavy fighting in the southern city 
of Nasiriyah. "In Nasiriyah, again a very fierce battle is taking 
place up until this moment when I'm talking to you. (US forces) have 
approached the city again, they are thrusting toward the city, and 
fierce battles are taking place," he said. ma/dab/mb Iraq-war-US-Britain-Mosul

The man accused of masterminding the murder of the Serbian prime minister 
Zoran Djindjic is on the run with a Serbian diplomatic passport as 
well as a fake Croat passport, Serbian police said on Tuesday. Milorad 
Lukovic Legija "has a false Croatian passport in the name of Vlado 
Vukomanovic, and in 1996 (under the Milosevic regime) obtained (...) 
a diplomatic passport," police said, on radio station B92. Legija 
-- named after his time with the Foreign Legion -- is suspected by 
police of masterminding Djindjic's murder on March 12. He is also 
the former commander of the now-disbanded elite police Unit for Special 
Operations (JSO) and the alleged leader of the Zemun criminal gang, 
which the authorities have come down hard on since the Djindjic killing. 
According to a Sarajevo weekly, Legija is hiding out in Bosnia with 
another former legionnaire, the Croat general Ante Gotovina, currently 
being sought by the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. Legija was 
also reportedly seen several times in the southern Bosnian town of 
Mostar. vs/co/jfs Serbia-attack-Legija

The mood is the same, only the cause is different: protesters rallying 
in the east German city of Leipzig against the Iraq war recall the 
scenes that helped topple the former communist regime. Every Monday, 
hundreds of people stream into the Nikolaikirche church for prayers 
for peace while outside, thousands rally under banners and placards. 
Then, both sets join together to march -- there were 45,000 Monday 
evening -- through the city centre in a show of popular strength. 
In 1989 they called for democracy, shouting: "We are the people." 
Now they demand an end to the conflict against Iraq, shouting: "We 
are the people, we don't want any war." "The Nikolaikirche was already 
a place of hope for many people during the 'Wende' in 1989," said 
its senior priest, Christian Fuehrer, referring to the word meaning 
'turn' which Germans use to describe the epochal events of that year. 
Fuehrer walks at the head of the rally. He says he is proud the people 
of Leipzig are taking to the streets again in a wave of protests that 
mushroomed out of a Christmas appeal by the church against the impending 
war. Monday's rally was the 12th such demonstration against the war. 
There was little sign of numbers going down, as activists had feared 
would happen once the conflict got underway. The Monday prayers for 
peace, begun at the Nikolaikirche in 1982, became a focal point for 
civil rights groups in what was then East Germany. Then, amid increasing 
agitation against the regime, 70,000 people gathered to demonstrate 
on October 9, 1989. Police and soldiers mobilised. There were fears 
of a violent repression. But the security forces did not intervene. 
The rallies gathered in fervour and strength. Hope spread of a democratic 
renewal. A month later the Berlin Wall was opened, a year later East 
Germany ceased to exist. The particular thing about the rallies then 
as now is their peacefulness, Fuehrer said, pointing out that they 
were not linked to political parties or trade unions. People are marching 
now for different reasons, he admitted. "But just like then, people 
want to get involved and leave nothing to politics. This is the people 
on the street." Sebastien Krumbiegel, a pop singer, said it highlighted 
a "special culture of democracy. People here have already shown once 
before that they can change things." Christine Severin, 56, joins 
the rally every week. "Every day brings more victims among the civilian 
population in Iraq. We have to make a stand," she said. She protested 
on the streets in 1989 too. "It became a tradition. It was a phenomenon 
of the Wende." "Then, we were afraid of violence by the East German 
regime," said Stefan Hoerning, "now we're protesting against violence 
in Iraq." "I see pictures of the war and I can't just sit at home 
behind my own four walls," he added. hex/km/loc/ns Iraq-war-demos-Germany

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda will not attend Wednesday's signing 
in Sun City, South Africa, of landmark agreements on post-war transition 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), his office said. "The invitation 
only came in on Saturday. The President had other commitments within 
the country that he was unable to cancel at such short notice," an 
official in Kagame's office said. On Tuesday, all sides in the peace 
talks adopted agreements reached in Pretoria on December 17 last year 
that provide for a two-year transition government to take the DRC 
through to democratic elections -- the first since those on independence 
from Belgium in 1960. Rwanda supports one of the largest rebel groups 
in the DRC, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, and until last year 
had thousands of its own troops there, saying these were essential 
to protecting its national security. hv/afm/nb RDCongo-talks-Rwanda-Kagame

Morocco will beat its tourist drum more loudly to counter a decline 
in visitors caused by the war in Iraq, Tourism Minister Adil Douiri 
said Tuesday. The number of tourists visiting Morocco has fallen less 
than 10 percent since the beginning of the Iraq crisis, he said, predicting 
the decline would remain "fairly weak" for now in the context of the 
war. Douiri said the ministry was launching an "action plan" that 
includes redirecting promotional budgets toward institutional communication.

Eighty-two percent of French people believe the US is wrong to make 
war in Iraq, as opposed to just seven percent who think it is right, 
according to a poll published on Tuesday. The proportion of opponents 
was up by two points from the last BVA poll on March 21, which showed

CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US Marines driving towards Baghdad captured 
a key canal bridge Tuesday after stiff fighting south of the central 
Iraq city of Hilla, their officers said. An AFP correspondent traveling 
with elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force said the troops 
were backed by artillery and two B-52 heavy bombers in their drive 
to take the canal. "There was good resistance initially," Major Cal 
Worth said of the Iraqis. "But again we finished them up. We continue 
to push on according to schedule." Scores of tanks and armored personnel 
carriers were seen rumbling towards the canal near Hilla, about 160 
kilometers (100 miles) due south of Baghdad. The marines are part 
of a general push towards the capital to topple the regime of President 
Saddam Hussein. Further west, the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division 
and 101st Airborne Division are also gearing for a move against elite 
Republican Guard units defending the approaches to Baghdad. np/pm/hc

Fifteen members of a family were killed late Monday when their pickup 
was blown up by a rocket from an Apache helicopter near Hilla south 
of Baghdad, the sole survivor of the attack told AFP Tuesday. The 
family was fleeing fighting between Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition 
in Nasiriyah, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of Baghdad, when the 
US helicopter fired on the jeep in Haidariya, 80 kilometers (50 miles) 
south of the capital, he said. Razek al-Kazem al-Khafaj showed an 
AFP photographer the coffins he said held the bodies of his wife, 
his six children, his father, mother and three brothers and their 
wives. sk/jch/sct/bp/mb Iraq-war-civilian-family

Hong Kong canto pop singer and actor Leslie Cheung plunged to his 
death from a hotel in the city's financial district, reports said 
Tuesday. Local media said Cheung, 46, who earned international acclaim 
for his portrayal of an opera star in the 1993 historical epic 'Farewell, 
My Concubine', had committed suicide. Cable Television reported that 
Cheung had left a note saying he was suffering from emotional problems 
before his death at the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong's Central district. 
A police spokeswoman refused to fully identify the dead man, saying 
only that a 46-year-old surnamed Cheung had died in hospital after 
falling from the 24th floor of a hotel in Central. "We received a 
report that a man had fallen from the Mandarin Hotel at around 6.40pm 
(1030 GMT)," the spokesman said. "The man, a 46-year-old surnamed 
Cheung, was taken to the Queen Mary Hospital and declared to be dead 
at 7:00 pm (1100 GMT). Police found there were no suspicious circumstances." 
Local television and radio reports identified the dead man as Cheung. 
Cheung was one of Hong Kong's most popular performers, notable for 
being one of only a few Asian stars to play openly gay characters. 
He came out about his sexuality after playing one of his most famous 
gay roles in the acclaimed 1997 movie 'Happy Together', directed by 
Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai. Cheung entered showbusiness after 
returning to Hong Kong following studies at Leeds University in northern 
England. He achieved success as a canto-pop singer and enjoyed Asian-wide 
fame with his successful 1981 album 'The Wind Blows On'. Cheung's 
success as a singer quickly paved the way for a career in film. Though 
he was to become noted for playing gay roles later in his career, 
Cheung made his breakthrough playing a rookie cop alongside Cantonese 
heart-throb Chow Yun-fat in John Woo's 1986 action movie 'A Better 
Tomorrow'. Two years later he earned a reputation for romantic roles 
after playing an opium-smoking playboy in Stanley Kwan's 'Rouge', 
one of the most successful films to emerge from Hong Kong during the 
1980s. Further collaborations with action guru Woo followed with 1990's 
'Once A Thief', before Cheung teamed up the following year with director 
Wong for 'Days of Being Wild'. rcw/th HongKong-people-Cheung

Portugal are building seven new stadia and completely renovating three 
others ahead of the 2004 European championship which they host from 
June 12 to July 4. More than 4,000 people have worked on the stadia 
which are located in eight cities across Portugal, and will cost an 
estimated 800,000 million euros (872 million dollars) to complete. 
ESTADIO DA LUZ Location: Lisbon Club: Benfica Capacity: 65,000 Cost: 
124 million euros (135 million dollars) Workers: 702 Conclusion date: 
September 30, 2003 Features: While its seating capacity will be less 
than the 120,000 that Estadio da Luz, which it replaces, Benfica's 
new stadium will still be Portugal's largest. Billed as Portugal's 
"new cathedral to football" the stadium features 7,000 VIP seats and 
two large screens. The ceiling is made of policarbonate, a lightweight 
transparent building material which will let in natural light. To 
maximize the amount of natural light the stadium receives, there will 
be a gap between the start of the ceiling and the end of the seating 
stands. More than a quarter of the cost will be swallowed by construction 
of the roof. The surrounding commercial area features a health club, 
a panoramic restaurant, 55 bars and various movie houses. The stadium 
will host five matches, including the final on July 4. ESTADIO JOSE 
ALVALADE Location: Lisbon Club: Sporting Capacity: 52,000 Cost: 102 
million euros (111 million dollars) Workers: 627 Conclusion date: 
July 31, 2003 Features: The new stadium is being erected beside the 
one it will replace and was modeled after Amsterdam Arena in The Netherlands. 
The oval exterior is covered in light green tiles, the colour of the 
Portuguese premier league's reigning champions. Like the stadium of 
arch-rivals Benfica located less than two kilometres away, Sporting's 
new stadium will feature a large commercial area with 15 cinemas, 
a playground, a clinic and a megastore. Sporting will inaugurate the 
new stadium with a match against Manchester United on August 6. Five 
matches will be played here, including one of the semi-finals. ESTADIO 
DAS ANTAS Location: Oporto (310 kilometres north of Lisbon) Club: 
FC Porto Capacity: 52,000 Cost: 100 million euros (109 million dollars) 
Workers: 619 Conclusion date: September 30, 2003 Features: Located 
on a hill overlooking the city, FC Porto's new stadium will feature 
just two stand levels, with two-thirds of the total seating capacity 
located in the lower stand. Two metalic arches will decorate the white 
roof over the stands. The stadium of Portugal's current premier league 
leaders will host the opening match of the 2004 European football 
championship as well as four other games. ESTADIO DO BESSA Location: 
Oporto Club: Boavista Capacity: 30,000 Cost: 37 million euros (40.2 
million dollars) Workers: 127 Conclusion date: May 30, 2003 Features: 
The hundred-year-old club's new stadium will be built on the site 
of the old one and will have 18,000 more seats as well as a hotel 
on its north side. Seats are on a particularly steep angle allowing 
for a good view of the field. Three matches will be played here. ESTADIO 
MUNICIPAL DE BRAGA Location: Braga (360 kilometres north of Lisbon) 
Club: Sporting Braga Capacity: 30,000 Cost: 55 million euros (60 million 
dollars) Workers: 639 Conclusion date: September 30, 2003 Features: 
Builders blasted over one million cubic metres of granite from Monte 
Castro, a mountain on the outskirts of Braga, to make room for the 
stadium. All of the seats are along the side of the pitch with the 
nortwestern side of the stadium, behind one of the goals, left open 
providing a view of the surrounding countryside. The opposite side 
of the stadium will face a huge wall of granite belonging to the exposed 
mountain where builders will place a 270 square metre television screen 
-- the biggest in Europe -- to allow fans to see replays of key moves. 
Two matches will be played here. ESTADIO D.AFONSO HENRIQUES Location: 
Guimaraes (355 kilometres northeast of Lisbon) Club: Vitoria de Guimaraes 
Capacity: 30,000 Cost: 28 million euros (30.5 million dollars) Workers: 
639 Conclusion date: September 30, 2003 Features: One of three stadia 
being refurbished for the tournament, builders are more than doubling 
seating capacity. The stadium is named after Portugal's first king, 
who was born in Guimaraes. Grey and white seats behind one of the 
goals create the image of King Afonso Henriques holding a shield and 
a sword. The stadium will host two matches. ESTADIO MUNICIPAL DE AVEIRO

oldest university, is undergoing its first renovation in its 45-year 
history to prepare for the Euro 2004. A nine-lane running track where 
many of Portugal's big-name runners got their start will be temporarily 
covered and some 17,000 seats have already been added. Two-thirds 
of the seats are covered. Two matches will be played here. ESTADIO 
DR.MAGALHAES PESSOA Location: Leiria (135 kilometres north of Lisbon) 
Club: Uniao de Leiria Capacity: 30,000 Cost: 50 million euros (54.5 
million dollars) Workers: 334 Conclusion date: September 30, 2003 
Features: While it is considered to be one of three stadia being refurbished, 
only 10 percent of the venue will be maintained in its original state. 
Some 19,000 new seats will be added, although the northern stand will 
be removed after Euro 2004 leaving just 25,000 seats. The stadium 
lies in the shadow of the verdant walls of a hilltop castle and will 
host two matches. ESTADIO ALGARVE Location: Faro/Loule (260 kilometres

One person was killed and a dozen others injured Tuesday in a grenade 
explosion triggered by suspected Muslim militants in Indian-administered 
Kashmir, a border guard spokesman said. Militants had thrown the grenade 
at a security force patrol, but it missed the target and exploded 
among passers by at the town of Anantnag, 50 kilometers (31 miles) 
south of Srinagar, the summer capital. One of the injured was a policeman, 
a border guard spokesman said. He added that two of the injured were 
in critical condition. Police have sealed off the site and were searching 
for the militants responsible. More than 38,000 people have died in 
Indian Kashmir since the start of anti-India rebellion in the scenic 
Himalayan region in 1989, although separatists put the toll twice 
as high. str/bm/th India-Kashmir-blast

The southern outskirts of Baghdad were pounded by an especially intense 
bombardment Tuesday that sent balls of fire and towers of black smoke 
into the sky, an AFP journalist in the Iraqi capital said. Massive 
explosions rocked the area around 4:30 pm (1330 GMT) in what was at 
least the third wave of bombings since dawn. Heavy bombing boomed 
out from the city's southern rim and the ack-ack of anti-aircraft 
batteries could be heard sporadically on the 13th day of the war. 
Iraq's Information Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf said 19 people 
had been killed and more than 100 wounded in strikes on Baghdad since 
Monday evening. Five of them died and 25 were wounded in Tuesday morning's 
raids. An AFP reporter saw a missile or smart bomb explode in the 
heart of the Republican Palace complex, the largest of eight presidential 
palaces in Baghdad, around 09:00 am (0600 GMT) after a dozen missiles 
crashed into the Iraqi capital overnight. A huge plume of smoke rose 
into the air over the sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of 
Saddam's grip on power which has been a frequent target of the bombardments. 
Around a dozen missiles struck the Iraqi capital overnight. US Central 
Command said in a statement that coalition forces had used "precision-guided 
munitions to target a regime office complex in eastern Baghdad" at 
around 11:30 pm (1930 GMT) on Monday. The complex served as an office 
for leaders of the regime and housed the youth ministry and the Iraqi 
National Olympic Committee, chaired by Saddam's elder son Uday, Centcom 
said. "The strike was executed to erode the command and control capabilities 
of regime leaders," it said, adding that battle assessment was ongoing.

BRUSSELS, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell could 
hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Thursday, official sources told AFP. An EU spokesman confirmed 
that Powell had asked to meet formally with EU foreign policy chief 
Javier Solana, the EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten 
and Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, whose country currently 
holds the EU presidency. The meeting, to be held at NATO's headquarters 
in Brussels, would be followed by an informal lunch with a group of 
foreign ministers from individual EU and NATO member states. It was 
not immediately known which foreign ministers would be likely to attend, 
spokesman Reijo Kempinnen said. Powell is set to arrive in Turkey 
later on Tuesday for discussions on the US-led war on Iraq, and will 
travel on to Brussels from there. While in the Belgian capital he 
will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, according to 
the Russian foreign ministry. NATO spokesman Yves Brodeur separately 
confirmed that Powell would probably take part Thursday in an extraordinary 
session of the North Atlantic Council, NATO's highest decision-making 
body. Diplomats said that this meeting could also take place at ministerial 
level. The US State Department has said Powell hopes to discuss issues 
related to the invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day, and about the 
post-war future of the oil-rich country. He could raise in Brussels 
the possibility of involving countries other than the United States 
and Britain in stabilising Iraq and maintaining order after the end 
of the war. Washington's strategy in Iraq has deeply divided its European 
partners and put strains on transatlantic relations. But the 15 EU 
members agreed at a summit on March 20-21 that the United Nations 
should play a central role in Iraq during and after the war. European 
calls for a UN-supervised administration in Iraq are becoming more 
strident amid concerns that Washington may cut non-US companies out 
of reconstruction contracts in Iraq. A spokeswoman for Patten, the 
EU external relations chief, stressed that the 15-nation Union was 
"primarily concerned that the United Nations should play a key role 
in Iraq after the war". She said it was too soon for the EU to discuss 
"concrete projects" in post-war Iraq, and that no hard decisions would 
be taken during the meeting. "We must above all else listen to the 
Americans to understand what is on their mind," she said. lby-lb/ec/jfs

Five firms have opened talks with the Bulgarian government over plans 
to build a nuclear power plant at Belene, on the Danube river, the 
Bulgarian energy ministry said on Tuesday. Russia's Atomstroieksport, 
US firm Westinghouse, France's Framatom, the Czech company Skoda and 
Atomic Energy of Canada have each briefed the ministry on which technology 
they propose to use. The ministry is due to decide on the basis of 
this information and to open a tender process for the nuclear power 
station, which would be Bulgaria's second, before the end of the year. 
The Bulgarian government began building a nuclear plant at Belene 
in 1987 but suspended it three years later under pressure from environmental 
groups. It decided at the end of 2002 to resume construction. The 
nuclear plant should become operational in 2008, and will cost an 
estimated billion dollars (920 million euros) to build, according 
to the government. So far the state has invested 1.3 million dollars 
in infrastructure for the plant. It has bought steam generators and 
a casing for a 1,000-megawatt water pressure reactor from the Czech 
Republic. Belene lies 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the west of Kozloduy, 
home to Bulgaria's only other nuclear power station. Two 440-megawatt 
Soviet-type reactors at Kozloduy were shut down in December and two 
more are due to be closed down by 2006, under an agreement with the 
European Union. Kozloduy supplies 45 percent of Bulgaria's electricity 
and also has two more modern 1,000-megawatt reactors whose future 
is not in doubt. vs/aro/ef/lmf Bulgaria-energy-nuclear

The UN's World Heath Organisation said on Tuesday that outbreaks of 
a deadly respiratory virus were being contained in Vietnam, Singapore, 
and Canada, with the main concern now centring on Hong Kong and China's 
Guangdong province. "Vietnam has contained the outbreak, Singapore 
is rapidly containing the outbreak, Toronto is rapidly containing 
it, so we don't anticipate that there will be spread from these places," 
David Heymann, head of the WHO's communicable diseases unit, said. 
But Heymann warned that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS) in Hong Kong -- which accounts for 530 of the 1,633 cases reported 
worldwide by WHO's headquarters since November last year -- may have 
taken on a "new form". Hong Kong authorities were rushing to see if 
a cluster of cases in a hotel and quarantined appartment block there 
might have been passed on by water, sewage or ventilation systems. 
"We will know tomorrow morning whether or not (the Hong Kong authorities) 
have been able to confirm that all the cases that they have now are 
still by person-to-person contact," Heymann told journalists. But 
the cluster there might equally have been caught from close contact 
in a lift or from a door handle touched by someone suffering from 
SARS, he said. A WHO team in Beijing was still trying to get regional 
authorities to allow them to go to China's Guangdong province, the 
source of the outbreak last November which is thought to account for 
about 806 cases. "We believe that an invitation will be coming, and 
as I say every day we haven't yet received that invitation," Heymann 
commented. "We believe that the outbreak is still going on in Guangdong 
from what the government has told us," he added. At least 58 people 
have died of SARS since November 2002, 34 of them in Guangdong, according 
to WHO. pac/kjm/ds Health-pneumonia-WHO

The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday he had not called on Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to quit but only advised him to make a "sacrifice" 
if that was the only way of ending the ongoing conflict. "What I said 
was that if the only thing that can resolve the situation in Iraq 
is a sacrifice from President Saddam Hussein, and since he is asking 
all Iraqis to sacrifice their lives for their country, the least expected 
of him is to do the same," Prince Saud al-Faisal told reporters. If 
the only thing that can stop the US-British campaign launched on March 
20 is a "sacrifice" from the Iraqi leader, then "he should listen 
to his own advice," Prince Saud said, adding it was not too late to 
do so. The Saudi foreign minister had all but urged Saddam to step 
down in an interview with ABC News late Monday. Since Saddam has "asked 
his people to sacrifice for the country ... he should be the first 
to sacrifice for his country," Saud said. "If his staying in power 
(is) the only thing that brings problems to his country, we expect 
that he would respond to a sacrifice for his country, as he requires 
any citizen there to." US President George W. Bush, backed by British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair, has launched the war on Iraq with the stated 
objective of toppling Saddam and ridding the country of alleged weapons 
of mass destruction. The Saudi chief diplomat also denied that the 
United States had been using an advanced command and control system 
at Prince Sultan Air Base in Al-Kharj, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south 
of Riyadh, to direct the war against Iraq. "Targeting Iraq is not 
done from Prince Sultan Air Base. The only duty given to the US troops 
(there) is to enforce the no-fly zone over (southern) Iraq," he said. 
Two days after the war broke out, Turkey announced the end of US-British 
operations to enforce a similar exclusion zone over northern Iraq 
from a Turkish air base. The Saudi minister also denied that the kingdom 
had granted permission for the United States to fly cruise missiles 
over its airspace, saying "there was no permission asked and none 
given." Saudi Arabia said Saturday it had protested to the United 
States after four sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles fired on Iraq 
went astray and crashed in the kingdom. oh/lg/hc Iraq-war-US-Saudi

Luxembourg anti-terrorist police have carried out wide-ranging raids 
targeting people suspected of links to Islamic extremism, judicial 
sources said on Tuesday. No one was arrested in the raids on Monday, 
during which 150 officers searched the homes of some 20 people suspected 
of having close links with international Islamic fundamentalism, state 
prosecutor Robert Biever said. Police also raided the offices of a 
Muslim association which preaches a radical brand of Islam. Documents, 
video tapes, computer equipment and brochures advocating holy war 
were confiscated, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. Biever 
also said the state was considering taking legal action against a 
group of suspected Islamic extremists. An investigation launched in 
the wake of the September 11, 2001 extremist attacks has uncovered 
strong grounds for an indictment on charges of criminal association, 
the prosecutor's office said. vp/iih/ec/jfs Luxembourg-attacks

Swaziland's King Mswati III announced a cabinet reshuffle Monday night, 
sacking his minister of transport amid fraud allegations six months 
ahead of general elections. Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini said on 
national radio the minister of public works and transport, Titus Mlangeni, 
and the minister of justice and constitutional affairs, Chief Maweni 
Simelane, would be removed from their positions. Mlangeni was dismissed 
for allegedly receiving kickbacks during the sale of an aircraft belonging 
to the kingdom last year while Simelane had been ill for two years 
and was removed for medical reasons. Dlamini announced two new appointees 
-- a former sports reporter at the Swazi Observer newspaper, Mahlaba 
Mamba, and Sipho Shongwe, who was minister of health in the 1980s. 
"On behalf of his majesty it gives me great pleasure to announce the 
appointment of two new ministers into cabinet positions and it is 
his majestys firm belief that the two new ministers would work well 
and represent him in whatever they will be doing," Dlamini said. Mamba 
will become the minister of natural resources and Shongwe was appointed 
the new health minister. The current minister of education, John Carmichael, 
will replace Mlangeni at public works and transport, and the minister 
of natural resources, Magwagwa Mdluli, will take over Simelane's position 
as minister of justice and constitutional affairs. The small mountain 
kingdom landlocked between South Africa and Mozambique is expected 
to hold national elections in October. str/fgb/hn/nb Swaziland-politics

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US employers, freezing decisions to hire 
and fire during the Iraq war, announced 38 percent fewer job cuts 
in March than in February, a survey showed Tuesday. Planned job cuts 
slid to 85,396 in March, the lowest level in six months, from 138,177 
in February, said a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and 
Christmas Inc. "March marked the culmination of the war build-up, 
and it clearly caused American businesses to put major decisions and 
actions on hold. One result: job cuts fell to their lowest level since 
September, 2002," said the firm's chief executive, John Challenger. 
"Corporate America is stuck in limbo. The one thing we do not expect 
is significant job creation," he said. The number of job cuts in March 
was down 17 percent when compared with March 2002. By sector, transportation 
cut the most jobs in March, announcing 19,397 reductions as airlines 
weathered a crisis. Electronics came second with 17,051 cuts and the 
government sector third with 11,493 cuts. Over the first quarter of 
2003, employers announced 355,795 job cuts, down 26 percent from a 
year before. The government sector, which had been one of the bright 
spots in terms of job creation last year, swung the biggest axe in 
the quarter with 61,658 job-cut announcements. "As unemployment climbs, 
revenue from payroll taxes continues to shrink. States are also suffering 
from a drop in sales tax revenue, as consumers finally appear to be 
reining in spending," Challenger said. "As a result, government agencies 
are being forced to make significant cuts wherever they can," he said. 
The retail sector, suffering from weaker consumer spending, came second, 
announcing 52,463 job cuts in the three months. Transportation was 
third with 31,114 job cuts posted in the quarter. djw/rl US-economy-jobs

The headlights of the Iraq war froze US employers' hiring and firing 
decisions and kept shoppers at home, industry surveys showed Tuesday. 
US employers announced 85,396 job cuts in March, down 38 percent from 
February, said a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and 
Christmas Inc. It was the lowest level of job cut announcements in 
six months. "March marked the culmination of the war build-up, and 
it clearly caused American businesses to put major decisions and actions 
on hold. One result: job cuts fell to their lowest level since September, 
2002," said the firm's chief executive, John Challenger. "Corporate 
America is stuck in limbo. The one thing we do not expect is significant 
job creation," he said. The number of job cuts in March was down 17 
percent when compared with March 2002. By sector, transportation cut 
the most jobs in March, announcing 19,397 reductions as airlines weathered 
a crisis. Electronics came second with 17,051 cuts and the government 
sector third with 11,493 cuts. Official unemployment figures for March 
are scheduled for release on Friday. Meanwhile, the first signs of 
the impact of the Iraq combat on the US high street revealed weakness. 
Consumers, glued to television for the opening shots of the Iraq war, 
sent sales into a 1.4-percent slump at US retail chain stores in the 
week ending March 29, according to a barometer drawn up by Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS Warburg. It was the steepest fall since December 
last year. "The 'CNN effect', which is the tendency for potential 
shoppers to stay home and watch the war coverage on television, was 
seemingly instrumental in restraining sales," the survey said. The 
Iraq war appeared to have a bigger initial impact on chain store sales 
than in the comparable period of the Gulf War, it said. Sales were 
generally below expectations, the survey said. Some reports also suggested 
that stores near US borders suffered as fewer people crossed into 
the United States to shop. Sales at chain stores in March were expected 
to be between flat and down 1.0 percent, partly because of the later 
arrival of Easter, which lands April 20 this year compared to March 
31 last year. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of US economic 
activity. "The war effect on monthly sales is likely to depress sales 
as well, but only modestly -- most likely no more than 0.5 percentage 
points -- since we believe much of that effect already has been depressing 
sales," it said. Government figures last week showed consumer spending, 
when adjusted for inflation, fell 0.4 percent in February, the steepest 
fall since September 2002. Fears of an Iraq war, combined with snowstorms 
and mass job cuts also sent February retail sales sliding 1.6 percent, 
the steepest dive since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, 
government figures showed. The key US surveys in the past month have 
shown US consumer confidence at or close to 10-year lows. djw/mac

Baseball pushed the Iraq war to the margins of the front pages on 
Tuesday, as the New York press mourned the prospect of a season without 
superstar Yankee's shortstop, Derek Jeter. After weeks of non-stop 
war coverage, the New York Post allowed its focus to switch from Baghdad 
to Toronto, where Jeter dislocated his shoulder Monday in a season 
opener against the Blue Jays. "Agony - Jeter's disaster" ran the Post's 
banner headline. A blow-up photograph of the all-star shortstop lying 
on the ground, clutching his shoulder, dominated the front page above 
a compressed report on an attack on Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's 
Republican Guard. The same picture -- albeit in smaller format -- 
also made the front page of the Daily News, Newsday and USA Today. 
Jeter suffered a dislocated left shoulder in a violent collision at 
third base with Blue Jays catcher Ken Huckaby during the third inning. 
There were fears that the injury could put him out for the rest of 
the season. The prominence given to the incident was a combined reflection 
of Jeter's celebrity status and the sense of anticipation surrounding 
the opening day of America's national pastime. Jeter's good looks 
have made him baseball's pin-up boy and he is as well known for his 
romantic liaisons off the field as his sporting prowess on it. gh/mac

France has failed to take steps to control its budget and will have 
a public deficit for both this year and next well in excess of the 
EU's three-percent limit, according to a highly critical European 
Commission report obtained by AFP Tuesday. The report -- which is 
the first stage in the disciplinary procedure launched after France 
posted a 2002 public deficit of 3.1 percent of gross domestic product 
(GDP) -- was due to be formally adopted by the commission Wednesday. 
It predicts a public deficit this year of 3.7 percent of GDP, followed 
by 3.6 percent for 2004 -- exceeding by a large margin the three-percent 
limit set down in the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. The report says 
the excess spending cannot be explained only by the deteriorating 
economic situation and blames France for not taking the necessary 
measures to bring it under control. It also predicts that France will 
breach the pact's rules on public debt, which is not supposed to exceed 
60 percent of GDP. But France's will hit 61.3 percent in 2003 and 
62.8 percent in 2004, according to the report. The commission bases 
its calculation on a French economic growth figure of 1.1 percent 
for 2003 and 2.1 percent for 2004. phv/hs/vs EU-eurozone-France-economy-deficit-debt

Beauty queens often trot out well-worn pledges to work for world peace, 
but the first Miss Tibet showed there may be some truth to the line 
when she was seen chatting to Miss China at a pageant on Tuesday. 
Dolma Tsering crossed a yawning political gulf to engage Miss China 
Dong Mei Xi on the sidelines of the Miss Tourism Intercontinental 
2003 pageant here. Both of them told reporters that they did not "wish 
to comment on any politics", but the organisers of the contest said 
they were happy to bring them to the same podium. "I am happy to see 
Tibet and China together in this pageant. It is a success in its own 
way of bringing people together," said promoter Alaric Soh. Tsering, 
who lives in the Indian capital New Delhi, won the title of first 
Miss Tibet in October in Dharamsala, where Tibet's government-in-exile 
has been based since a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.

The top election official in Turkmenistan on Tuesday insisted that 
a series of weekend elections would prove the democratic credentials 
of the isolated and repressive Central Asian state. "There is not 
one neighbourhood lacking alternative candidates for voters to choose 
from -- this demonstrates that pre-election campaigning has taken 
place on competitive democratic principles," Murat Karyev, chairman 
of the central election commission told AFP. Turkmenistan, a former 
Soviet republic, has been condemned most recently by the pan-European 
rights body the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(OSCE), which accused it of "mind-boggling" rights abuses in a report 
published in March. Voting on Sunday will be for a national people's 
assembly of 65 people and for 5,535 local councils, as well as four 
parliamentary by-elections, the election commission said. The people's 
assembly usually meets annually to issue guidance on the overall direction 
of governmental policy, rather than to pass legislation. Elections 
to parliament, which is tasked with passing legislation, are due next 
year. The election comes as President Saparmurat Niyazov attempts 
to improve his image following international criticism of a wave of 
repressive measures which followed an alleged assassination attempt 
against him last November. Niyazov fears being targeted as a rogue 
leader by the US-led allies who are currently trying to unseat Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein, the head of the Institute of War and Peace 
Reporting's Kazakhstan office, Edward Polyetayev, said. "Niyazov worries 
that he could be next. His only source of support is his people and 
the election will bring forward new people devoted to him. At the 
same time he hopes to improve Turkmenistan's image," Polyetayev said. 
But Western countries will take a lot of convincing that Turkmenistan 
can hold democratic elections. "The contrast between the law as it 
is presented and the reality marked by terror and fear is mind-boggling" 
said the OSCE report, which questioned whether an assassination attempt 
had actually taken place and the subsequent conviction of 62 people 
including several foreign ministers. Turkmenistan has prevented the 
OSCE from monitoring previous elections and the pan-European body's 
Ashkhabad office declined to say whether it would be monitoring Sunday's 
election. In recent months several Western oil and gas companies have 
halted efforts to develop Turkmenistan's vast gas and oil resources. 
Turkmenistan's electorate numbers some 2.2 million people out of a 
population of 4.7 million. str/njc/hm/ds Turkmenistan-vote

CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - US marines captured a key canal bridge 
Tuesday in their drive towards Baghad, their officers said after fighting 
which reportedly left dozens of civilians dead in accompanying air 
strikes. An AFP correspondent traveling with the troops said they 
were backed by artillery and two B-52 heavy bombers in their drive 
to take the canal near the town of Hilla, 80 kilometers (50 miles) 
south of Baghdad. A hospital director said 33 civilians, including 
children, were killed and 310 wounded in air strikes against a residential 
area at the southern outskirts of the farming town. Fifteen members 
of a family were also killed late Monday when their pickup was blown 
up by a rocket from an Apache helicopter near Hilla, the sole survivor 
of the attack told AFP Tuesday. Major Cal Worth said the Iraqis put 
up a fight against the marines' advance. "There was good resistance 
initially," he said. "But again we finished them up. We continue to 
push on according to schedule." Scores of tanks and armored personnel 
carriers were seen rumbling towards the canal near Hilla. The marines 
are part of a general push towards the capital to topple the regime 
of President Saddam Hussein. Further west, the US Army's 3rd Infantry 
Division and 101st Airborne Division are also gearing for a move against 
elite Republican Guard units defending the approaches to Baghdad.

Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen on Tuesday expressed hopes 
that the United Nations Security Council would reach an agreement 
on a resolution for the reconstruction of Iraq after the current war. 
"This should be possible even if the Council disagreed about the military 
action currently underway," Rasmussen told reporters, adding: "It 
is in the interest of all countries to come together on the reconstruction 
of Iraq." "But I must say that if the Council does not reach agreement 
on this, others will have to take care of it because we cannot leave 
the Iraqi people to face their destiny alone," he said in a veiled 
reference to the United States. Concern has mounted in Europe that 
Washington intends to sideline non-US companies in the process, after 
the very first reconstruction contracts were awarded to US firms last 
week. France has repeatedly called for a UN-supervised administration 
in Iraq to oversee the reconstruction process. Rasmussen, whose country 
is part of the US-led coalition fighting in Iraq -- although it has 
sent no ground or airborne forces -- said he believed the UN had to 
play a central role in Iraq after the war. "This is not just a question 
of repairing the damage inflicted during this armed conflict, but 
also the reconstruction of damage inflicted on an Iraqi society hit 
by 12 years of economic santions and subjected to the tyrannic regime 
of Saddam Hussein," he said. He said Danish companies had not received 
any orders for the reconstruction of Iraq. The head of maritime transport 
and petrol group A.P. Moeller, Denmark's largest company, said last 
week he saw commercial possibilities for his group in the reconstruction 
of Iraq. sa/po/ds Iraq-war-UN-Denmark

Russia on Tuesday accused US authorities of misleading both domestic 
and international opinion by manipulating media reports on the war 
in Iraq, which Moscow strongly opposes. "We have all seen the bias 
in the information provided, the violations of the rights of journalists 
and the way they deceive the American public and the international 
community as a whole," a spokesman for the press ministry said in 
a statement, as quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency. The statement 
did not cite any examples of the alleged manipulation by US officials. 
Last week a group of US Congressmen accused the White House of stifling 
opinion opposed to the US-led invasion of Iraq, now in its 13th day. 
The press media statement came in response to a report issued by the 
US State Department in which Russia was criticised for alleged constraints 
on press freedom, RIA Novosti noted. The press ministry "reaffirms 
the inviolability of the principles of free speech and media independence 
in Russia and hopes that US statements will be more balanced and unbiased 
in the future," the statement said. Over the past two years several 
independent or opposition Russian media organizations have been closed 
down following alleged pressures or intervention by pro-government 
structures, giving rise to fears voiced in Washington and elsewhere 
that the Kremlin was seeking to stifle opposition. ig/bb/hm/jfs Iraq-war-Russia-US-media

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US manufacturing activity slumped in March 
as the run-up to the Iraq war sapped demand and extinguished a four-month 
expansion, a survey showed Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management 
(ISM) purchasing managers' index, based on a survey of supply executives, 
slid to 46.2 points in March from 50.5 in February. A reading below 
50 points indicates an industry contraction. "The manufacturing sector 
failed to grow in March, marking the end of four consecutive months 
of growth," the survey chief, Norbert Ore, said in a statement. "Supply 
managers continue to be challenged by business conditions," Ore said. 
"The start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. 
In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization," 
Ore said. djw/mac US-economy-ISM

Germany's postal service, Deutsche Post, said Tuesday that it had 
suspended staff travel to some Asian countries amid concern about 
a respiratory virus that has killed more than 60 people. The company 
said its employees would no longer travel to China, Hong Kong, Vietnam 
and Singapore until further notice and that it had advised personnel 
not to make any private trips to the countries. Deutsche Post employs 
some 380,000 people world wide, although the number of employees likely 
to travel regularly to and from Asia for business purposes is not 
known. The illness, known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or 
SARS, erupted in southern China's Guangdong province in November, 
then spread to Hong Kong and more than a dozen other countries, infecting 
some 1,900 people. Business meetings that had been planned in the 
region would now be conducted by video conference, Deutsche Post said.

Fifteen members of a family were killed late Monday when their pickup 
was blown up by a rocket from an Apache helicopter near Hilla south 
of Baghdad, the sole survivor of the attack told AFP Tuesday. The 
family was fleeing fighting between Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition 
in Nasiriyah, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of Baghdad, when the 
US helicopter fired on the jeep in Haidariya at 6:00 pm (1500 GMT), 
he said. Razek al-Kazem al-Khafaj showed an AFP photographer the coffins 
he said held the bodies of his wife, his six children, his father, 
mother and three brothers and their wives. "Which one of them should 
I cry on?" Khafaj said, before throwing sand in his face "so I don't 
have to see" the remains of his 15 relatives before him. A hospital 
director in Hilla, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad, 
said 33 civilians, including children, were killed and 310 wounded 
in coalition bombing Tuesday morning of the Nader residential area 
on the southern outskirts of the farming town. US marines, meanwhile, 
captured a key canal bridge near Hilla on Tuesday in their drive toward 
Baghdad, their officers said. An AFP correspondent traveling with 
the troops said they were backed by artillery and two B-52 heavy bombers.

Italian defence and aeronautics group Finmeccanica said on Tuesday 
it was preparing a bid for aircraft engine maker FiatAvio with the 
backing of a US investment fund. Finmeccanica chief executive Roberto 
Testore said the group had "practically agreed" a deal with US fund 
Carlyle Group that would form the basis of negotiations with heavily 
indebted industrial giant Fiat over the possible acquisition of its 
subsidiary. Finmeccanica chairman Pier Francesco Guarguaglini said 
his company was "primarily interested in FiatAvio's space activities". 
FiatAvio is involved in Europe's Ariane space programme, supplying 
parts of the rocket engines and boosters. Finmeccanica did not say 
how big a stake it intended to acquire in FiatAvio. ot/lmf/vs Italy-air-company-takeover-Finmeccanica-FiatAvio-Carlyle

Attackers fired automatic rifles at a police post near a train station 
used by tourists heading to the famed statue of Christ overlooking 
Rio de Janeiro, police said Tuesday. Police said the attackers fired 
from a car during the night and fled. They said there were no casualties. 
But it was the latest incident in a campaign by the Brazilian city's 
notorious drug gangs. On Monday, two police were killed when their 
patrol came under fire from some 30 heavily armed drug traffickers, 
who comandeered vehicles and set them alight, blocking part of a major 
road running through the Bonsucesso district. At the same time, the 
Meridian hotel on Copacabana beach and a neighbouring supermarket 
were attacked with Molotov cocktails, while another gang sprayed the 
Del Castilho metro station with bullets. Officials said the latest 
attacks were a response to the imprisonment Friday of traffickers 
connected to Brazil's principal drug lord Luiz Fernando de Costa, 
alias "Fernandinho Beira Mar". The rising drug-related violence, including 
the assassinations this month of two judges and the threatening of 
as dozens more, have led to fears of the "Colombianisation" of Brazil's 
until now relatively low-key drug trade. pfm/tw Brazil-violence

Residents of Paris's Chinatown were watching with apprehension Tuesday 
the continuing spread of the unidentified killer disease atypical 
pneumonia, with many in the French capital considering putting off 
voyages to the east for fear of catching it. "We're all waiting to 
see what happens before we buy our tickets," said Philippe Nguyen, 
an art dealer who is planning a business trip to North Vietnam. "All 
the family is saying that there's no risk there, but I am cautious. 
I would rather take the risk of ordering goods without seeing them 
than of falling ill," he said. Around 40,000 people originally from 
east Asia live in a high-rise area of the 13th arrondissement, or 
district, south of the river Seine. Most of them are ethnic Chinese 
from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. At a local travel agency -- CFA Voyages 
-- staff report 30 percent of trips cancelled or postponed. Next door, 
baker Yv Nghy says he will spend his holidays in Europe this year. 
"I was going to go to Hong Kong, but it's not sensible," he said. 
At a pharmacy in the Massena 13 shopping complex, would-be travellers 
come to buy face masks, pneumonia vaccines and other drugs they hope 
may give protection against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 
but they are told not to bother. "Mask or no mask, it is better not 
to go. As long as the pathogen remains unidentified, it is impossible 
to protect onself properly," said Sylvie Larnaudie, chief pharmacist. 
Those most at risk are the elderly -- mainly Laotians and Cambodians 
-- who are unable to read French and so remain uninformed about the 
progress of the disease. "My job is to tell them," said Dr Suda Viengchai 
at the pharmacy. "They come here looking for medicine kits for their 
journey -- pills to stop diarrhoea or paracetamol. That's when I explain 
to them the precautions to take, the symptoms to look out for, and 
who to contact if they have doubts." cnp/hs/jfs Health-pneumonia-France

Sun City, a casino resort in the South African bush, has been the 
setting for talks which facilitators say will see it immortalised 
as the place where Africa's biggest conflict was settled. Nestled 
under the Pilanesberg mountains, Sun City has hosted some 360 government, 
opposition, rebel and civil society delegates from the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC) in a final session of the Inter-Congolese 
Dialogue. George Ola-Davies, spokesman for Sir Ketumile Masire, chairman 
of the talks, said he believed that concluding the Sun City negotiations 
ranked in significance with cities where famous agreements were adopted. 
"This ranks with places like Lusaka, where several peace accords have 
been signed, or Rome," said Ola-Davies. "Sun City is magnificent for 
a big country like the DRC -- it will be so nice to talk of the Sun 
City agreements," he told AFP. On Wednesday, delegates, in the presence 
of an expected 10 heads of state, will sign final agreements to end 
the process towards a transition in the vast central African country 
that was set in motion here 14 months ago. Some 150 kilometres (95 
miles) west of Pretoria, the hotel complex has long hosted world events 
in entertainment. In 2001, the crowning of Miss World was followed 
by two annual two-million dollar Sun City golf challenges. But never 
before has the resort, with its kitsch African "Lost Palace", hosted 
a massive forum with the political profile of the Congolese dialogue, 
which started here on February 25 last year. The resort is no stranger 
to political controversy. Built by hotel magnate Sol Kerzner in the 
"tribal homeland" of Bophutatswana in the late 1970s, Sun City was 
a gambling and fleshpot getaway from repressive Calvinistic laws thought 
up by Afrikaner leaders wearing black homburg hats. Bophutatswana 
was a so-called independent "bantustan" created by apartheid's architects. 
Its laws were not heavy-handed when it came to gambling and pornography, 
treated as dire vices elsewhere in South Africa. It also gave generous 
tax breaks to anybody willing to invest there. But Sun City's willingness 
to acknowlege the bantustan in which it was built legitimised "grand 
apartheid" -- the term used to describe white South Africa's segregationist 
policies. Many artists refused to play at the Sun City Superbowl in 
the 1980s because of this association. Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Linton 
Kwesi Johnson, Bruce Springsteen and Ringo Starr and others under 
the banner of Artists United Against Apartheid released a protest 
song against Sun City in 1985. "Bophuthatswana is far away. But we 
know it's in South Africa no matter what they say...I ain't gonna 
play Sun City," the lyrics go. With the end of apartheid in 1994, 
South Africa's laws on gambling and pornography relaxed and the lure 
of "Sin" City gradually diminished. No more was it necessary to drive 
for hours for the pleasures of the flesh when they were at the nearest 
video store, and a gambling casino might be a few minutes down the 
road. Sun City needed to reinvent itself, and in 1992, Kerzner set 
new aims to lure people. Instead of going downmarket, he went up, 
targeting mainly overseas visitors who could pay extravagant prices 
and enjoy unheard-of luxury at the newly opened Lost Palace, crown 
piece of South Africa's Las Vegas in the bushveld. An awe-inspiring 
piece of architecture, it sports live-size statues of elephants and 
antelope made from copper and other metals. The imitation tusks lining 
the hotel's roof reinforce the publicity stunt on which the complex 
is built. "Fleeing the barbarians of the northern deserts, a gentle, 
cultured people wandered ever southwards," press releases trumpeted. 
"For years they roamed their wild continent, through steaming jungles 
and razor-backed mountains until they found it... A valley silvered 
by crystal streams, cloaked in lush forests." The line is still believed 
by gullible tourists and local day-trippers who go there to gamble, 
play golf and catch the African sun on an imitation beach at the Valley 
of the Waves. Down the road, one finds the Superbowl, the Cascades 
Hotel complex and the original Sun City hotel, in which the cling-clang 
of one-armed bandit slot machines never ceases. It is a strange setting 
for closing deliberations on one of Africa's most complex conflicts.

Dora Bakoyiannis, the first woman to become mayor of Athens, testified 
on Tuesday in the special court trying 19 alleged members of an armed 
group that claimed reponsibility for killing her husband in 1990. 
"Why did you kill Bakoyiannis?," she icily asked the defendants from 
the witness box as the trial of alleged members of the November 17 
urban guerrilla group continued. "Read the proclamation," replied 
Dimitris Koufontinas, the group's alleged top assassin, referring 
to the reasons given by the group at the time, which related to an 
alleged financial scandal. Koufontinas has assumed political responsibility 
for November 17 actions, but denies individual charges. The group, 
blamed for a wave of political killings over three decades, notably 
claimed responsibility for the murder of Bakoyiannis' husband Pavlos 
in 1990. Bakoyiannis is the daughter of Greece's former prime minister 
Constantine Mitsotakis and also number two in the country's main opposition 
party. November 17 had accused Bakoyiannis of being involved in a 
financial scandal that shook Greece in the late 1980s. But his widow 
testified that the group killed the journalist and conservative MP 
because he helped engineering the rapprochement between Greece's Right 
with the country's communist Left. This cooperation led to the overthrow 
of the country's scandal-tainted socialist government of the day. 
November 17 is held responsible for 23 political assassinations of 
Greek and foreign officials between 1975 and 2000. Its members had 
evaded security forces until last year when Greek authorities -- under 
pressure to get security under control ahead of next year's Olympic 
Games -- made their first arrests. On Monday, George Petsos, a former 
socialist minister who narrowly escaped a November 17 attack, accused 
the group of trying to kill him, possibly in cahoots with Greek intelligence 
services, as he said, in order to make him a scapegoat for the same 
scandal. dk/pap/ds Greece-trial

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Vice President Dick Cheney has indefinitely 
postponed an April trip that would have taken him to China, Japan, 
South Korea and Australia, in order to devote his full attention to 
the war against Iraq, his office said Tuesday. "This is not the right 
time" for the voyage, Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise said 
without confirming the vice president's itinerary apart from the stop 
in China. "It's an important region, and we believe it's a trip we 
should do at a time that allows for it," said Millerwise, who noted 
that Bush in January cancelled a trip to Africa for "the very same 
reason." The spokeswoman did not mention a new target date for the 
trip, which US President George W. Bush announced last October as 
he welcomed then-Chinese president Jiang Zemin to his beloved Texas 
ranch. Cheney would have travelled to Japan, South Korea, as well 
as Australia -- which has contributed combat troops to the US-led 
war effort Iraq -- according to administration officials who declined 
to be named. China has followed France's lead in opposing the military 
campaign to disarm and topple Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The visit 
would have brought Cheney face to face with Chinese President Hu Jintao 
for the first time since Hu took office, even as Washington courts 
Beijing's support for ending Pyongyang's nuclear arms program. The 
United States is trying to convince China to back a multilateral forum 
to discuss the crisis, but Beijing has thus far been cool to the idea 
and instead promotes bilateral talks between the United States and 
North Korea. News that Cheney was putting off this trip came after 
the US Centers for Disease Control and the US State Department warned 
Americans to postpone non-essential trips to Asia due to the spreading 
outbreak of a deadly pneumonia known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS). Millerwise said that was not a factor in the decision. The 
virus claimed another life on Tuesday with an 83-year-old Hong Kong 
man succumbing to the disease. SARS has now killed 34 people in China, 
16 in Hong Kong, four in Vietnam, four in Canada, four in Singapore 
and one in Thailand. It also came as China rejected as "irresponsible" 
a US report that accused the country of having a poor human rights 
record and told the United States stop meddling in the affairs of 
other nations. The US State Department on Monday accused China's communist 
leaders of presiding over a "poor" human rights record last year, 
saying the government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses. 
Human rights have long been a source of contention between the two 
countries, which while enjoying improved relations in the past year 
due to cooperation in fighting terrorism and booming trade, have not 
ironed out key differences such as rights matters. ok/mac US-China-Cheney-postpone

India on Tuesday said it had lost all telephone contact with its embassy 
in Baghdad following the bombing of a nearby building. "What I understand 
is that the telephone connections have been cut off. Now our embassy 
in Amman is trying to contact our embassy in Baghdad," India's foreign 
ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna told AFP. He said the whereabouts 
of 14 Indians who had voluntarily stayed back in Iraq was not known. 
"The 14 Indians have been staying there of their own volition. They 
were charity workers and Islamic students based in Najaf and nuns 
in Baghdad. They had been advised to go back," Sarna added. India 
had shifted most of its staff from the embassy in Baghdad to Amman 
before the start of the US-led war against Iraq. bm/th Iraq-war-India

American Airlines appeared Tuesday to have staved off bankruptcy after 
reaching last-minute deals with three unions to secure 1.8 billion 
dollars in cost savings for the world's biggest airline. AMR Corp. 
parent company of the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline, asked all employees, 
including management, for a total of 1.8 billion dollars in permanent, 
annual savings to help save the debt-ridden company. The announcement 
came late Monday, as the company was preparing to file for creditor 
protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. "By taking 
these decisive actions, the union leadership and our employees have 
demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the future of the company, 
and have enabled us to avoid an immediate filing with the bankruptcy 
court," the company's chairman Don Carty said. Analysts said the deal 
bought time for AMR, but there is no guarantee it will not follow 
United Airlines, US Airways and Hawaiian Air into bankruptcy. Morgan 
Stanley analyst William Greene said he was maintaining a cautious 
stand and "underweight" rating for the company "until we are convinced 
of the company's future viability." But JP Morgan said said in a note 
it was upgrading AMR from underweight to "neutral," based on the company's 
expected renewed access to capital, improvements in cash burn rates, 
and materially reduced (Chapter 11) risk." While the broker noted 
that AMR is "not out of the woods entirely", the airline, along with 
Delta Air Lines "now enjoys the relative luxury of time." The cost-cutting 
deal came a day after the Allied Pilots Association announced its 
proposal meeting American Airlines' targets for 660 million dollars 
in contract cost reductions. Additional cuts in costs for the airline 
amount to 340 million dollars from flight attendants, 620 million 
from workers represented by the Transport Workers' Union, 80 million 
dollars from agents, representatives and planners, and some 100 million 
dollars from management and support staff. American Airlines had said 
in a statement Sunday that, "Face-to-face negotiations continue around 
the table, around the clock with the mechanics, flight attendants 
and pilots." The company also said that company chairman Carty would 
take a 33 percent base pay cut, decline a bonus for the third year, 
and ask the board of directors to significantly reduce the value of 
his and his senior officers compensation packages. American employees 
will have access to a new stock option and profit sharing program. 
The deal still needs approval from the unions' memberships. The company 
also needs to secure "meaningful concessions" from its vendors, lessors 
and suppliers, Carty said. American Airlines is one of many US airlines 
in severe financial difficulties amid a general economic downturn 
and a slump in air travel following the September 11 attacks in 2001. 
The number two carrier United Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection 
last year. US Airways announced Monday its emergence from seven months 
of bankruptcy, after slashing 1.9 billion dollars a year in annual 
costs under bankruptcy court supervision. The US airline industry 
last week appealed for some four billion dollars in government aid, 
saying the Iraq war and terrorism fears had pounded air travel. bur-rl/tw

Two dozen people leapt Tuesday from the rear door of a Cuban airliner 
held at Havana airport by a man claiming to be armed with two grenades 
and asking to be flown to Miami. The group was seen being taken away 
by bus after escaping the Soviet-made Antonov AN-23 which initially 
had 40 adults, including the crew, and six children on board. One 
woman leapt to safety with a child in her arms, witnesses said. The 
plane had been en route from the Isle of Youth to Havana late Monday 
when the hijacker ordered the crew to head for Miami, but it was forced 
by lack of fuel to land at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport. 
A fuel truck spent nearly two hours beside the aircraft early Tuesday, 
and it was shortly after that the passengers made their escape. It 
was not immediately clear whether they were allowed to leave by the 
hijacker in return for taking on fuel. The plane remained parked on 
the tarmac, surrounded by a heavy police presence. All flights in 
and out of the airport have been canceled and inconvenienced passengers 
have been put up at hotels in Havana. Authorities said they were doing 
their utmost "to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives 
of the passengers." The hijacker threatened to detonate the grenades 
if his demand to be flown to Miami is not met, officials said. "The 
individual is at the back of the plane, apparently with two hand grenades, 
and he could possibly have some accomplices" on board, authorities 
said in a statement. "This act is the direct result of the encouragement 
US authorities have given hijackers with their incomprehensible behavior 
in the wake of the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner to 
the United States by six terrorists armed with knives," the statement 
said. "The responsibility for what will happen will fall entirely 
on the government" of the United States, it added. The statement referred 
to the March 19 hijacking to Florida of another Cuban airliner with 
33 people on board after it also flew out of the Island of Youth. 
That plane was forced to land by US warplanes in Key West, Florida's 
southernmost island, where the hijackers were taken into custody. 
Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum in the United States; 
the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later ruled that the six hijackers 
could be released on a 25,000 dollar bond pending trial, but the decision 
is being appealed. Cuban President Fidel Castro criticized the judge's 
decision and asked if the United States planned to put the six hijackers 
in a "gilded cage," wondering how their treatment would compare with 
the spartan conditions meted out to al-Qaeda and Taliban members confined 
at the US base in Guantanamo, Cuba. Cuba has also been critical of 
the US policy of granting asylum to any Cuban who manages to set foot 
on US soil -- like the 11 passengers on the March 19 flight. Those 
intercepted on the high seas are returned to the communist island.

US-British bombings kill 48 more civilians south of Baghdad: hospital 
= (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - UPDATES with details, quotes, second deadly 
raid /// HILLA, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - Forty-eight more civilians, 
including women and children, have been killed and 310 wounded in 
US-British bombings around this town south of Baghdad in the last 
24 hours, a hospital director said Tuesday. The deaths brought to 
73 the number of Iraqi civilians who have died under allied bombings 
since Monday. Thirty-three civilians, including women and children, 
were killed and 310 wounded in a coalition bombing on the southern 
province of Babylon on Tuesday morning, a hospital director said. 
Murtada Abbas said the bombing targeted the Nader residential area 
at the southern outskirts of the farming town of Hilla, 80 kilometres 
(50 miles) south of the capital. He was speaking at the Hilla hospital 
where a large number of children lay wounded under blankets on the 
floor due to a shortage of beds. At the scene of the bombing, dozens 
of what seemed to be parts of cluster bombs equipped with small parachutes 
were peppered over a large area, an AFP correspondent at the site 
said. Iraqi soldiers were seen collecting the debris, which witnesses 
said coalition warplanes had dropped over the neighborhood. The soldiers 
poured fuel on the bombs before setting them on fire to explode the 
ordnance. Dozens of homes were destroyed in the bombing that also 
killed donkeys and chickens, the correspondent said. Fifteen members 
of a family were killed late Monday when their pickup truck was blown 
up by a rocket from a US Apache helicopter in the region of Haidariya 
near Hilla, the sole survivor of the attack told AFP on Tuesday. Razek 
al-Kazem al-Khafaji said he lost his wife, six children, his father, 
his mother, his three brothers and their wives. Khafaji, sitting among 
the 15 coffins at the local hospital, said the family was fleeing 
fierce fighting in Nasiriya, further south, when they were targetted 
by a US helicopter in Haidariya. US troops admitted killing seven 
women and children when they opened fire Monday on a civilian vehicle 
at a military checkpoint manned by the US Army's Third Infantry Division 
at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad. On Monday, eighteen 
civilians were also killed in coalition bombings on Baghdad, according 
to Information Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf. ks-nay/bp/srj Iraq-war-raid-civilian-toll

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US stocks of precision bombs are holding 
up despite an intensifying air campaign over Iraq that has expended 
thousands of bombs and missiles in the first 12 days of the war, the 
secretary of the air force said Tuesday. The air force stepped up 
production of satellite-guided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) 
a year before the start of the war, building up "a good backlog," 
and retains large inventories of laser guided bombs, said Air Force 
Secretary James Roche. "So no concern as of this point about inventory," 
he said. Roche said gravity bombs have been used in situations where 
they are more effective that precision weapons, but most strikes have 
been carried out with JDAMs he said. jm/mac Iraq-war-US-munitions

Two Palestinians threw stones at the US consulate in annexed east 
Jerusalem on Tuesday, Israeli public radio said. One of the men was 
arrested by police and the other managed to escape, the radio said. 
The US-led war against Iraq has aroused considerable anger among Palestinians, 
who have drawn parallels between the invasion of Iraq and Israel's 
long-standing occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Tens 
of thousands of Palestinians have marched in protest at the war across 
the territories. In Gaza City on Tuesday, some 1,500 Palestinians 
turned out in front of the parliament building to burn a coffin draped 
in US, British and Israeli flags, shouting slogans denouncing the 
war and the silence of Arab leaders in the face of the conflict. In 
Bethlehem in the southern West Bank, some 1,000 gathered in front 
of a church marking the birthplace of Jesus Christ to condemn the 
war. The demonstration also marked the first anniversary of a siege 
in the Church of the Nativity which started when Israeli troops a 
year ago raided the town, as they did almost the entire West Bank, 
to hunt down militants. Around 200 people, including many gunmen, 
sought sanctuary in the church, starting a six-week siege that ended 
in the exile of 13 gunmen. The crowd demanded on Tuesday that the 
exiles be allowed to return. str-chw/jh/srj Iraq-war-US-Palestinian

One of the world's largest aeronautics conglomerates, Bombardier, 
is planning a massive equity sale combined with a substantial downsizing, 
The Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday. The financially troubled 
conglomerate is planning to sell equity to the tune of up to 680 million 
dollars (one billion Canadian dollars) and get rid of its recreational 
products division which produces snowmobiles and jet water-skis. An 
announcement is expected Thursday and could even include the selling 
off of the group's troubled Bombardier Capital. The Globe and Mail 
said CIBC World Markets is organizing the underwriting of the massive 
restructuring deal which reportedly has the support of more than 125 
of Bombardier's top creditors. Bombardier has already faced a major 
slowdown in purchases of its regional jet range of aircraft and, with 
the Gulf War continuing at a slower pace than many had believed, cancellations 
of existing orders are being anticipated. hfw/pfm Canada-Bombardier

French parliamentarians on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for the government's 
planned privatisation of Air France, adopting a text that would see 
the government give up its controlling stake in the flag carrier. 
"I think we've put together the best possible plan, which fulfills 
our determination to protect the interests of French airlines, those 
of Air France and in particular those of its employees," said Transport 
Minister Gilles de Robien. Under the plan, approved by lawmakers from 
the ruling UMP party against vociferous opposition from the Socialists 
and other left-wing groupings, the government would sell most of its 
54.4 percent of Air France, leaving it with a minority stake just 
below 20 percent. Most of the stake would be sold to private shareholders, 
with 15 percent earmarked for Air France staff -- who currently hold 
12.7 percent of the company. The plan would also give the company 
tight control over its own operating licence and international access 
rights, helping to protect it against any foreign takeover. De Robien 
told the senate in February that the privatisation would take place 
in mid-to-late 2003. "The government intends, obviously, to protect 
the interests of the taxpayers," he said at the time. "The operation 
will not be undertaken until market conditions allow." However, Prime 
Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government badly needs privatisation 
revenues to help reduce its burgeoning debt -- now edging close to 
the European Union-imposed limit of 60 percent of gross domestic product 
-- at a time when tax cuts and falling growth are paring its revenues. 
The government last month reduced its 2003 growth forecast to 1.3 
percent, just over half the 2.5 percent forecast underpinning its 
budget for the year. cl/lmf/vs France-air-AirFrance-privatisation

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US manufacturing activity slumped in March 
as the run-up to the Iraq war sapped demand and extinguished a four-month 
expansion, a survey showed Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management 
(ISM) purchasing managers' index, based on a survey of supply executives, 
slid to 46.2 points in March from 50.5 in February. A reading below 
50 points indicates an industry contraction. "The manufacturing sector 
failed to grow in March, marking the end of four consecutive months 
of growth," the survey chief, Norbert Ore, said in a statement. "Supply 
managers continue to be challenged by business conditions," Ore said. 
"The start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. 
In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization," 
Ore said. A breakdown of the figures showed: -- The ISM production 
index crumbled to 46.3 points in March from 55.4 in February, showing 
the first contraction in manufacturing production in 16 months. -- 
New orders retreated, with the new orders index sliding to 46.2 points 
in March from 52.3 in February. -- Employment shrank faster, with 
the employment index retreating to 42.1 points in March from 42.8 
in February. -- The backlog of orders dwindled, with the index slumping 
to 41.5 points in March from 49.30 in February. "March was not a good 
month for manufacturing, as the sector appears to have lost its momentum," 
Ore said. "Employment continues to be a problem as the index has now 
been below 50 percent for 30 months." Manufacturers liquidated their 
inventories at a faster rate, the survey showed, with the inventories 
index sliding to 42.3 points in March from 43.8 in February. Prices 
paid by manufacturers rose for the 13th month. The index climbed to 
70.0 points from 65.5 in February. New export orders rose but at a 
slower pace. The export orders index fell to 52.0 points from 55.5 
in February. djw/tw US-economy-ISM

The British economy was caught in the crossfire of the war in Iraq 
last month when many shoppers deserted stores and companies were reluctant 
to commit to new business, surveys showed Tuesday. With British troops 
in the Gulf, many people were either glued to the television, protesting 
against war or just wary of spending money, causing the most significant 
fall in retail sales for over a decade, a report indicated. The survey 
of retailers, published by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), 
said that of 227 respondents only 28 percent said sales were up in 
March from the same month of the previous year, while 41 percent said 
they were down. The difference between the two gives a balance of 
minus 13 percent, the first significant fall since January 1999 and 
the lowest balance since July 1992. The survey was conducted between 
March 4 and 19, before the war actually began on March 20. "Sales 
growth has stalled in almost every retail sector," said CBI chief 
economic adviser Ian McCafferty. "These results confirm our fears 
that consumer confidence has been affected by uncertainties surrounding 
the war in Iraq, the impending tax rises and worries about the housing 
market," he added. This month British consumers face increases in 
both national insurance, a direct payroll tax, and council tax, which 
is imposed by local authorities. A separate report by the British 
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply meanwhile showed that 
worries about the war helped to drive manufacturing activity last 
month down to the lowest level since December 2001. The organisation's 
manufacturing index fell to 46.1 in March from a downward-revised 
48.1 in the previous month. A reading below 50 signals contraction. 
"This war has come at a very bad time for the manufacturing industry," 
said Roy Ayliffe, the institute's director of professional practice. 
"New orders took a bad hit last month, with firms clearly very reluctant 
to commit to new business with the current instability of the geo-political 
situation," he added. Economists said that although more clues were 
needed before a full picture develops of the damage being inflicted 
on the British economy by the war in Iraq, the surveys did not augur 
well. "At the moment I think the Iraqi war is just leaving the recovery 
picture on hold," said Investec bank economist David Page. "It depends 
how long this war lasts. The longer it lasts the more damage it is 
going to wreak on not just the UK but the global economy," he added. 
The surveys will give Bank of England policymakers much to chew over 
when they meet next week for their monthly interest rate decision. 
They will also make grim reading for Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon 
Brown, who was already expected to cut his forecasts for economic 
growth and hike those for public borrowing when he delivers his annual 
budget on April 9. dr/pw/vs Iraq-war-Britain-economy

Life sentence sought for confessed killer of Dutch populist by Gerald 
de Hemptinne ATTENTION - UPDATES with quotes from defence closing 
arguments/// AMSTERDAM, April 1 (AFP) - The prosecution on Tuesday 
called for the man who confessed to killing Dutch right-wing leader 
Pim Fortuyn to be imprisoned for life, describing the assassination 
as an attack on democracy. "This was a murder of freedom of speech," 
said prosecutor Koos Plooy in his closing argument on the third day 
of the trial. "Whoever hits the heart of the democratic process must 
be severely punished," he told the court. Fortuyn was killed in May 
last year, just days before general elections in which his party was 
to score impressive gains. On Tuesday, the public gallery of the high 
security courtroom in Amsterdam known as "the bunker" was packed with 
Fortuyn supporters who cheered as Plooy announced he would seek life 
imprisonment. Van der Graaf, a 33-year-old animal rights supporter, 
confessed in court last week to the killing of Fortuyn. In their closing 
argument his defence lawyers argued that the murder was not an attack 
on democracy. "Democratic society has not been disrupted," said lawyer 
Britta Boehler. "It is certain that the elections would have gone 
differently (without the assassination) but we do not know how," she 
told the court. The murder of the flamboyant, anti-immigrant Fortuyn 
stunned the Netherlands which had not seen a political assassination 
in its recent history. In his confession Van der Graaf said that he 
shot Fortuyn because he was "a danger to the weaker groups in society"; 
namely Muslims, asylum seekers, immigrants and animals. According 
to his defence team Van der Graaf killed Fortuyn because in his mind 
this was the only way to save democracy. Van der Graaf's attorney 
Stijn Franken told the court it would be "unthinkable" to sentence 
his client to life imprisonment for one murder. He pointed out that 
in the Netherlands the usual sentence for a single premeditated murder 
starts around 12 years in prison. Van der Graaf has been charged with 
premeditated murder, threatening Fortuyn's driver with a weapon, illegal 
possession of firearms and ammunition. The prosecution said Tuesday 
that it would drop a fourth charge of possession of explosive chemicals 
because Plooy felt he had not presented enough evidence to support 
the charge. A psychiatric report ordered by the court and presented 
on Monday concluded that the suspect had some mental problems but 
was fit to stand trial and could be held responsible for his actions. 
Fortuyn was shot five times at close range as he left a radio studio 
in the central town of Hilversum on May 6, 2002, just 10 days before 
the Dutch general elections. He had rattled the Dutch establishment 
with his open homosexuality and fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric. But 
he also won broad favour with many voters who felt there was finally 
someone who spoke frankly and addressed their concerns. In his closing 
argument the prosecutor cast Van der Graaf as a cold-blooded killer 
who liquidated Fortuyn because he did not approve of his political 
ideas. After Fortuyn was killed, his LPF party went on to score well 
in the election and to take part in a coalition government. However 
that administration collapsed in September, and Fortuyn's party crashed 
in the ensuing elections, held in January. But despite the LPF's fall 
from grace, Fortuyn's outspoken views and anti-immigrant stance, vigorously 
attacked before by mainstream politicians, are now openly debated 
in parliament. The judges are expected to deliver their verdict in 
two weeks. gdh-sb/gk Netherlands-crime-Fortuyn-trial

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell has 
added a stop in Belgrade to his lightning trip to Ankara and Brussels 
to discuss the ongoing war in Iraq, senior State Department officials 
said Tuesday. Powell will make a brief stop in the Serbian capital 
on Wednesday en route from Turkey to Belgium to show US support for 
the country that was shaken last month by the assassination of Prime 
Minister Zoran Djindjic, the officials said. "He wants to pay his 
respects and re-affirm our commitment to emerging democracies like 
Serbia," one official told AFP on condition of anonymity. A formal 
announcement of the Belgrade stop was expected later Tuesday from 
deputy State Department spokesman Philip Reeker, the officials said. 
Powell will be the highest-ranking US official and first secretary 
of state to visit Belgrade since the 1999 Kosovo conflict that eventually 
led to the downfall of former Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic. 
Djindjic, who was slain on March 12, was instrumental in the movement 
to oust Milosevic and later turned him over to the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) where the he is now on trial 
for war crimes. The Serbian Interior Ministry said Monday that Djindjic 
had been murdered by self-styled patriotic forces in Milosevic's name 
and there have been charges that the ex-leader's wife ordered the 
killing. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, who disappeared in 2000 
just before her husband was ousted from power, has flatly denied the 
accusations. mvl/mac US-Serbia-Powell

A final act to be signed at Sun City on Wednesday to establish a government 
of national unity in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after four 
years of brutal warfare provides for integrating rebel fighters in 
a restructured national army. Under agreements reached among rival 
DRC sides in the South African resort, amnesties will be offered for 
war-related deeds. Main points: FIGHTING AND ARMED FORCES: Signatories 
renew commitments to cease hostilities and embark on the process of 
setting up a restructured and integrated army as agreed during discussions 
in Sun City last year. The new army will include fighters of the Ugandan-backed 
Congolese Liberation Movement (MLC) and Rwandan-backed Congolese Rally 
for Democracy (RCD), rebel splinter groups, and the pro-government 
Mai-Mai militia. Their headquarters staffs met in Pretoria in March, 
but only the RCD has signed an agreement on the military. Agreement 
was reached on withdrawal of foreign troops and disarmament of armed 
militias. SECURITY: Each political leader will have the right to five 
to 15 bodyguards. No extra government troops may be deployed to Kinshasa. 
The police force will be integrated. The international community will 
be asked to provide a neutral force to secure politicians and institutions 
until the integrated police force can be deployed. CONSTITUTION: Declares 
the global and inclusive agreement of December 17 and the constitution 
to be the only sources of power during a two-year transition to elections. 
It declares the inviolability of the fundamental liberties and rights 
of the individual. OBJECTIVES: Reunification, pacification, reconstruction, 
restoration of territorial integrity and reestablishment of the state's 
authority throughout the country. Organisation of free and transparent 
elections at all levels. PRINCIPLES OF TRANSITION: Institutions must 
have appropriate representation from the 11 provinces and different 
political and social tendencies. Women must take part at all levels. 
The president, vice presidents and presidents of the Senate and National 
Assembly cannot be removed unless they commit grave crimes. Institutions 
will operate on the basis of consensus, inclusivity and non-conflict. 
Amnesty will be accorded for war-related deeds with the exception 
of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. LENGTH OF TRANSITION: 
Elections to be held within 24 months of investiture of the transitional 
government, but this period may be extended for six months, then a 
second six months, to cope with logistical electoral problems, by 
agreement of an independent electoral commission and the two houses 
of parliament. TRANSITIONAL INSTITUTIONS: The following will be created: 
an independent electoral commission; a human rights observatory; a 
media high authority; a truth and reconciliation commission; a commission 
to oversee ethics and the fight against corruption. POWERS: The president 
nominates senior officials, and has the power to declare war with 
the agreement of the cabinet and parliament. VICE PRESIDENTS: Four 
vice presidents will be drawn from the government, the MLC, the RCD 
and the political opposition. MINISTRIES: Thirty-six ministries are 
split among the government, rebels, the Mai-Mai and the political 
opposition and civil society. Interior and finance go to the government, 
defence and state enterprises to the RCD, foreign affairs and the 
budget to the MLC. PARLIAMENT: The speakership of the National Assembly 
-- the last major sticking point -- goes to the MLC, which argued 
that it needed it for a fair balance of power. The National Assembly 
will have 500 members and the Senate 120 members, designated by the 
signatories. JUDICIARY: The first president of the Supreme Court, 
the attorney general and the military auditor general will be appointed 
immediately under a balancing mechanism to be agreed by the signatories.

A paramilitary soldier was killed and another injured by tribesmen 
resisting a government operation to destroy a crop of opium poppies 
in northwestern Pakistan, officials said Tuesday. The clash occurred 
in the Mohmand tribal area bordering Afghanistan, where hundreds of 
paralimitary troops are engaged in uprooting poppies planted in thousands 
of acres of land in the semi-autonomous region. Witnesses said a tribesman 
was also killed in the clash. A tribal leader in Mohmand told AFP 
the situation was tense and sporadic firing was continuing from both 
sides. The tribesmen have taken positions on the hilltops. Local security 
officials said they were continuing with their drive to eradicate 
opium poppies, the raw ingredient for heroin, despite the clash. str-rj/th

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) asked the Venezuelan government on Tuesday 
to ensure the safety of a humanitarian mission to a strife-torn region 
along its border with Colombia, from which hundreds of civilians are 
reportedly attempting to flee. The UNHCR wants to send an evaluative 
mission to the isolated Rio de Oro region in northwest Venezuela, 
where the arrival of Colombian paramilitary forces two weeks ago has 
forced at least 200 civilians, including 90 children, to leave their 
homes, a spokesman said. Unconfirmed reports say that another 600 
people, including members of the indigenous Bari community, have fled 
the mountainous zone. Colombian left-wing rebel groups are fighting 
right-wing Colombian paramilitaries in the area, occasionally engaging 
the Venezuelan army. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday 
that he had ordered aerial bombing in the frontier zone to prevent 
an incursion by an armed Colombian group, without specifying which 
side in the conflict they represented. jlv/co/ds UNHCR-Venezuela-Colombia

More than 200 would-be immigrants, among them 25 of Iraqi origin, 
landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa off Sicily by ship, the 
Italian coastguard announced Tuesday. The ship, spotted by a coastguard 
airplane patrol, sank 47 miles northeast of the island, after all 
of its 207 passengers -- 168 men, 17 women and 22 children mainly 
from Ghana, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Somalia -- had been safely 
taken to land. They received medical treatment and food at the refugee 
centre of Lampedusa. Most were transferred to other centres after 
settling identification formalities, since Lampedusa's facilities 
are limited to 88 people. African and Asian refugees frequently land 
on the Italian islands of Lampedusa and Limosa, situated between Tunesia, 
Sicily and Malta, as they seek access to western Europe. str/ljm/iih/gk

Reports of coalition forces killing dozens of Iraqi civilians on Tuesday 
stoked growing international unease already high after seven women 
and children were shot dead in a truck at a US checkpoint in Central 
Iraq. Thirty-three civilians, including children, were killed and 
310 wounded in a US-British coalition bombing on the southern province 
of Babylon early Tuesday morning, a hospital director said. A missile 
or bomb hit a residential area called Nader south of the city of Hilla, 
80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Baghdad, an AFP reporter at the 
scene said. Meanwhile 15 members of a family were killed late Monday 
when their pickup was blown up by a rocket from an Apache helicopter 
near Hilla south of Baghdad, the sole survivor of the attack told 
AFP Tuesday. Several injured children were taken to hospital, some 
seen lying on the floor due to the lack of beds. Earlier Iraqi Information 
Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf 19 people had been killed and more 
than 100 wounded since late Monday. The checkpoint shooting -- the 
worst of its kind during the 13-day war -- occurred at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad on Monday afternoon, US Navy 
Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said at operational headquarters 
in Qatar. Commentators and officials agreed that the incidents, together 
with continual bombing on Baghdad, were likely to fuel vocal international 
opposition to the war and deal a severe blow to the coalition bid 
to win the trust of the Iraqi people. "If such scenes become routine... 
the political war for Iraq could be lost even before the military 
one is won," the New York Times warned in an editorial. The British 
government admitted for the first time Iraqi civilians may see US-British 
forces as villains not liberators, only hours before reports early 
Tuesday that American troops had fired on a civilian vehicles killing 
seven women and children. "We know that for the moment we will be 
seen as the villains. We knew that from the reaction before the conflict 
started," Home Secretary David Blunkett told BBC television. Owens 
said the victims were in a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at 
the military post despite repeated warning shots fired by US troops. 
Four people in the vehicle escaped unharmed. "As a last resort, they 
(US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," 
said Owens, adding that an investigation had been opened. The Washington 
Post reported however that 10 civilians had been killed in the incident 
and quoted US Army 3rd Division Captain Ronny Johnson as shouting 
over the radio to his men after the shooting: "You just (expletive) 
killed a family because you didn't fire a warning shot soon enough." 
Baghdad also claimed that coalition warplanes had attacked a group 
of "human shields" including US nationals. According to Iraqi officials, 
hundreds of civilians have been killed in the 13-day-old war. With 
US troops on edge after a suicide car bomb attack Saturday near Najaf 
killed four soldiers, the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) in Geneva said it regretted the checkpoint incident and hoped 
US troops took "all the necessary measures" to warn the civilians 
before opening fire. Meanwhile the air campaign to soften up the Iraqi 
forces increased. The southern outskirts of Baghdad were pounded by 
an especially intense bombardment Tuesday that sent balls of fire 
and towers of black smoke into the sky, an AFP journalist in the Iraqi 
capital said. Massive explosions rocked the area around 4:30 pm (1330 
GMT) in what was at least the third wave of bombings since dawn. AFP 
reporters said the raids on Baghdad were growing more intense and 
that a barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to have hit 
the battered city's downtown area. Saddam's main presidential palace 
complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his iron 24-year 
rule, came under fresh daylight bombardment on Tuesday for the second 
consecutive day. Iraq brought up reinforcements for Republican Guard 
units defending the approaches to Baghdad, US officers said, as US 
forces pressed their operations ahead of an expected major push on 
the capital. Major John Altman, intelligence officer for the 3rd Infantry 
Division's First Brigade, said the Republican Guard's armored Medina 
Division had been heavily battered by days of air strikes, artillery 
attacks and assaults by the tank-busting Apaches. US commanders have 
said their troops were within 100 kilometers (60 miles) of the capital 
in their drive to remove Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Some have 
signaled a major tank battle could be shaping up in the next week. 
US officers said 200 Iraqis were killed, wounded or captured in the 
clashes which broke out overnight near Karbala, 80 kilometers from 
Baghdad. In the north, coalition warplanes kept up heavy airstrikes 
on Iraqi army positions in and around the oil centre of Kirkuk, rebel 
Kurdish officials said. Iraqi Information Minister al-Sahhaf said 
that Iraqi forces prevented British forces from landing near the strategic 
city of Mosul in northern Iraq, and killed many of the troops. However, 
reports from the scene said the last Iraqi resistance had been wiped 
out in Abu al-Khasib and that the British troops were being welcomed 
by some residents. In Kuwait, air raid sirens sounded for the first 
time since Saturday. A defence ministry spokesman later said an Iraqi 
missile had been shot down over southern Iraq. In Basra, seen as key 
to controlling the southeast, British troops said they were waiting 
for reinforcements before making a final push to take the city. An 
Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British soldiers 
had been killed in fighting since Sunday, most of them around Basra, 
with an unspecified number of others killed in other parts of Iraq. 
Officials in London said a British soldier was killed on duty in southern 
Iraq, taking to 26 the British death toll since the start of the war. 
US authorities say at least 39 US soldiers have been killed. In Qatar, 
Brooks said that US forces had captured an Iraqi general in fighting 
in the Karbala region. On the diplomatic front US Secretary of State 
Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with European Union foreign 
ministers in Brussels on Thursday, official sources told AFP. Powell 
was set to arrive in Turkey later on Tuesday for discussions on the 
US-led war on Iraq, and will travel on to Brussels from there. The 
United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Tuesday it -- and not the 
United States -- was responsible for checking that Iraq did not possess 
any atomic weapons, after a report that Washington wanted to set up 
unilateral weapons inspections. burs/pvh/jfs Iraq-worldwrap

Augusta have scrapped a controversial plan to introduce an age limit 
of 65 years for past champions to compete in The Masters. Hootie Johnson, 
chairman of Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, 
said that the lifetime exemption for past champions will remain a 
Masters qualification. "After discussions with Arnold Palmer and Jack 
Nicklaus, the Club has decided not to implement the past champions 
qualification change next year," Johnson said. "Arnold, Jack and I 
agree that past winners should be able to play as long as they'd like, 
so long as they feel they remain competitive. We will count on our 
champions to know when their playing careers at the Masters have come 
to an end." Palmer, 73, plans to play in next week's Masters and again 
in 2004, which would bring his years competing in a tournament he 
has won four times - 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964 - to 50. "I had it 
in the back of my mind ... that I want to play competitively in the 
Masters for 50 years," said Palmer. "I am personally very pleased 
that will be possible now that the matter has been resolved as I hoped 
it would be. "Jack and I are grateful to Hootie Johnson for his thoughtful 
consideration of this issue, and thank him on behalf of all of the 
past champions for retaining this important Masters tradition." The 
news was also welcomed by German two-time winner Bernhard Langer. 
"Arnie is welcome wherever he wants to play. I think there will be 
a time when even Arnie will say, 'It's enough.' Whenever that time 
is, he will know," said Langer. American golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, 
a six-time Augusta National champion, confirmed he plans to compete 
in the 43rd Masters tournament. Nicklaus, 63, skipped the Masters 
in 2002 with a back problem but said he felt good after a couple of 
practice rounds last weekend. sg/ea/nr03 Golf-USPGA-Masters

International organisations voiced concern Tuesday for civilians caught 
on the frontlines of the Iraq war, after US troops shot dead seven 
Iraqi women and children who failed to stop at a checkpoint. The shooting 
occurred late Monday at a checkpoint manned by the US Army's Third 
Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, 
and came as civilian casualties continued to mount in the Iraqi capital. 
"Civilians must be spared as far as is possible. Equally soldiers 
have the right to assure their own security and a balance between 
these two elements must be found," said Antonella Notarim, spokeswoman 
for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). "I cannot 
make any comment on what happpened. We were not witnesses. I can only 
regret profoundly that once again civilians are affected," she added. 
US military officials said US troops opened fire on the vehicle after 
it ignored two warnings to stop. US forces in Iraq have been on a 
heightened state of alert and are approaching Iraqi civilians with 
caution following a suicide car bombing near Najaf on Saturday that 
killed four soldiers. But in Brussels the European Commission appealed 
to combattants to "show their restraint when it comes to civilians." 
"This is a horrible and tragic incident ... It is not an isolated 
incident. Too many civilians have already lost their lives in this 
war. "It shows that however advanced the technology, there is no war 
without loss of innocent lives," said a spokesman. The UN special 
rapporteur for human rights in Iraq, Andreas Mavrommatis also sharply 
criticised coalition bombardments which have hit Iraqi civilians. 
"Respect to the right to life, to my mind, enjoins combatants to abort 
the process when the targeting of assets entails foreseeable risks 
to civilians," he told a press conference in Geneva. "What we expect 
now is for the war to be over the soonest and that events such as 
the carnage in the market place in Baghdad would not occur again," 
Mavrommatis said. The US media meanwhile warned of the accidental 
killing of civilians would have a sharp impact on public opinion in 
Iraq and the Middle East. "Even if accidental, such events, like the 
deaths of civilians in Baghdad attributed to errant US bombs, can 
incur large political costs both in and outside Iraq," the Washington 
Post said. The New York Times concurred, stating that, "... billions 
around the globe are seeing and hearing reports that women and children 
were gunned down yesterday while riding in a civilian van at an American 
checkpoint. "This is just what the Iraqi commanders have in mind when 
they send soldiers disguised as noncombatants to fire on unsuspecting 
American troops. The killing of the soldiers is an incidental benefit. 
"The real goal is to turn the Americans against Iraqi civilians and 
cause them to behave like a hostile occupying army rather than the 
friendly liberators we had envisioned," the paper said. At US military 
headquarters in the Gulf state of Qatar, a senior US commander said 
civilian losses were regrettable but unavoidable in war. "Our efforts 
may result in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result 
in the loss of Iraqi military lives," Brigadier General Vincent Brooks 
told a press briefing. "While we regret the loss of civilian lives 
... they remain unavoidable as they have been throughout history," 
he said. bur/hs/jkb Iraq-war-checkpoint-reax

The head of the Athens Olympic organising committee (ATHOC) has issued 
an upbeat bulletin on preparations for next year's Games, but warned 
that with 500 days to go there wasn't a minute to lose. "We have come 
a long way in a very short time," Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, president 
of the Games' Organising Committee, said on Tuesday. But she added: 
"Even with such progress, we don't have a minute to lose. We have 
a great deal to accomplish in a very short time. "Despite the pressure 
we are increasingly confident that our preparations will be completed 
on time." Angelopoulos-Daskalaki reeled off a number of accomplishments 
already achieved - top of her list being the near-completion of the 
Olympic village. The ATHOC boss said a security exercise "with our 
allies" had passed off without a hitch and she said the Greek government 
had selected the contractor charged with providing all the technical 
and communications equipment for the Olypmic security operations. 
"Operational schedules for all competition and non-competition venues 
is finalised," she added, "and starting this August we proceed with 
the test events". "We have a clear plan of what must be accomplished 
in the 500 days that remain," she concluded. In January International 
Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge praised Athens' preparations 
as "outstanding" but the Belgian surgeon warned that deadlines were 
"tight". bur/nr/ea03 Oly-2004-GRE

Iraqi tribal forces fight alongside US troops in Iraq: US military 
by Stephen Coates ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details on attack, background 
/// AS-SALIYAH, Qatar, April 1 (AFP) - Around 100 Iraqi tribesmen 
have fought alongside US troops in central Iraq and more are expected 
to join the battle against the regime of Saddam Hussein, a US military 
spokesman said Tuesday. General Vincent Brooks said the local militias 
attacked with troops from the First Marine Expeditionary Force near 
the towns of Diwaniyah and Shatra, south of Baghdad. "Approximately 
100 tribal men joined the coalition forces in these attacks, and resulted 
in the captures of enemy prisoners of war, weapons, the destruction 
of bunkers and the removal of explosives from a bridge," he said. 
"There were no friendly casualties." Coalition commanders were initially 
hoping to ignite a popular rebellion against the Saddam regime and 
capture Baghdad with a minimum of fighting. Instead they have met 
stiff resistance from irregular paramilitaries and militiamen loyal 
to the ruling Baath party, raising concerns that the US-led coalition 
has blundered into what could become a protracted guerrilla war. Saddam 
has repeatedly called on Iraq's tribal groups to fight against the 
foreign invaders. Iraqi television last week reported that peasant 
gunmen had shot down a US helicopter, a claim dismissed by US officers. 
But there have been signs that tribal elders, who command small groups 
of lightly armed men, are prepared to defend Saddam against the might 
of the US and British military. Brooks told reporters at coalition 
headquarters here that US-British troops were receiving more and more 
assistance from ordinary Iraqis, despite growing civilian casualties 
in the war. "We've operated in a variety of areas and in close contact 
with tribal leaders and tribal members. Where we can find an access 
point or find someone who is interested in contacting us, we will 
pursue that," he said. He said information from local people had helped 
US special forces and regular troops in raids against regime "death 
squad locations" and Baath party headquarters around Baghdad. Locals 
had also lent assistance to British soldiers around the southern city 
of Basra, resulting in the destruction of a "considerable amount" 
of Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers. In the north, American 
soldiers also have been working with local Kurdish fighters to coordinate 
ground and air attacks against Iraqi positions and alleged terrorist 
bases. US special forces troops and CIA agents reportedly roamed the 
countryside of Afghanistan with suitcases full of money to buy the 
allegiances of warlords ahead of the attack on the Taliban regime 
there in late 2001. Local tribesmen are still playing a central role 
in Afghanistan as they help US troops hunt down the remnants of the 
Taliban and the al-Qaeda terror network. While such operations were 
generally considered a success, some of the Afghan warlords were accused 
of providing poor intelligence which led to air strikes on civilians. 
Brooks said he could not give details on how Iraqi tribesmen were 
recruited or where they came from, but added he expected more of them 
to ally themselves to the coalition as the Saddam regime weakened. 
"We think we're going to see a whole lot more of those (tribal forces) 
in the coming days as they continue to show up ... As the regime is 
pushed back, peeled back or destroyed, people will start seeking freedom 
for themselves," he said. smc/srj Iraq-war-US-tribal

The killing of seven women and children by US troops at a checkpoint 
in Iraq on Monday was a brutal lesson for the coalition military, 
and experts in Israel, which has long experience with such roadblocks, 
warn more such blunders will occur. "I think we are bound to see more 
of these because US troops are inexperienced in this type of war, 
this type of environment," said Shlomo Brom of the Jaffee Centre for 
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. Experts in Israel, whose 
military has hard-won experience in running checkpoints in the occupied 
Palestinian territories, said US troops were unprepared for this kind 
of attack, the threat of which Israeli troops face daily in the West 
Bank and Gaza. Despite its experience on the ground, the Israeli army 
has made its share of deadly blunders: in 30 months of fighting against 
the Palestinian intifada, 58 Palestinians have been killed at Israeli 
checkpoints, the Palestinian rights group LAW said Tuesday. Of that 
number, 20 were women and 13 children. Other Palestinian groups put 
the number even higher, at 72. Apart from the danger to both sides 
-- 10 soldiers were killed by Palestinian snipers at a West Bank checkpoint 
last March --, there are the humiliating waits and security searches 
that push tensions ever higher and remind the civilian population 
they live under occupation. The army says the roadblocks on the major 
raids in the territories are justified to stop Palestinian militants 
sneaking into Israel or attacking the many Jewish settlements and 
army bases in the occupied zones. While posing little threat to the 
Israeli military, kamikaze bombers have killed scores of Israeli civilians 
after infiltrating towns and cities. The situation in southern Iraq 
contains some similar challenges to those faced by the Israeli army, 
said the military specialist of Channel 10 television here, Alon Ben 
David. "If you look at the urban combat conducted in the last two 
days ... you see fighting very similar to what happened here in Defensive 
Shield," the operation by the Israeli army last spring to invade almost 
the entire West Bank after a spate of suicide bombings, he said. Brom 
said a suicide car bombing at another US checkpoint in southern Iraq 
on Saturday explained the jumpiness of the US troops who on Monday 
opened fire on a civilian car which failed to stop at their checkpoint. 
"When the troops are very tense, they cannot differentiate between 
friends and foes, and this kind of incident is bound to happen," said 
Brom, adding that US forces in Iraq, which invaded 13 days ago to 
topple President Saddam Hussein, were still in the learning stage. 
He said the way to reduce the risk of such tragic accidents was to 
"adopt the correct procedures and keep the discipline of the troops." 
The US-led forces "still haven't adopted the correct procedures for 
the situation", he said. "They are experiencing the stage of fear 
and distrust, because currently what they know is that anyone is a 
potential suicide bomber. They are not used to it like the Israelis 
are," said Ben David. He said the solution was to strengthen the checkpoints' 
defences to better protect troops and make them less jumpy. "If you 
provide them with some kind of protection -- you see a lot of concrete 
barricades in the territories -- that gives the soldier an extra second 
to respond because he is not that exposed, he is able to think for 
a second before he shoots," he said. While the suicide bombing is 
unlikely to have any military impact on the US-led campaign, the blundered 
killing of the civilians will have serious consequences for the US-British 
attempt to win Iraqi "hearts and minds." "It's very difficult to get 
the heart of people when you are killing their civilians," noted Brom.

The European Commission is to launch formal proceedings against France 
for the state guarantees it grants to national power giant Electricite 
de France (EDF), European Union sources said on Tuesday. A proposal 
to take action against the guarantees, seen by the commission as unfair 
to rival European power firms, was on the agenda for Wednesday's meeting 
of the executive, one source said. "Everything's been decided. No 
further changes can be envisaged," another source said. The development 
comes after Mario Monti, the competition commissioner, said in a newspaper 
interview last month that he planned to launch proceedings over guarantees 
to the state-owned company "in the first week of April". France has 
refused the commmission's call to eliminate the EDF guarantees. The 
commission's move would give Paris one month to supply legal arguments 
justifying the state guarantees EDF enjoys on its borrowing, which 
the commission believes distort competition by improving the company's 
credit rating and reducing its borrowing costs. France argues the 
advantages are a fair exchange for EDF's legal obligation to provide 
a universal service across the country. Monti last October launched 
a probe into both the state guarantees and tax relief granted to EDF 
by the French government. EDF is earmarked for partial privatisation 
by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's right-wing government, but 
the sell-off is not expected before 2004. bpi/lmf/vs EU-eurozone-France-energy-company-EDF

Three Afghan border guards, including a commander, were killed in 
an ambush by suspected Taliban in the southwest Afghan province of 
Nimroz, bordering Pakistan, a local offical said. "Yesterday (Monday) 
at 9:30 in the morning five men armed with Kalashnikovs and machineguns 
attacked the car of a border commander who was on his way from Kang 
district to the centre of Nimroz," said Aminullah, secretary to the 
governor of Nimroz. "Commander Najibullah himself, and two of his 
men were killed. He was head of a detachment of border guards in Kang 
district, bordering Pakistan," he told AFP by telephone. "The car 
was stolen and later found in the neighbouring province of Farah, 
but the attackers had fled," said Aminullah, who like many Afghans 
has just one name. "It is a political act, it is the Taliban or fighters 
of (former premier and renegade warlord) Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who carried 
out this assassination," he claimed. Armed attacks have risen in recent 
days in south and southeast Afghanistan, homeland of the Pashtun tribes, 
from whom the majority of the Taliban came. wm-hba/mtp/rj/th Afghanistan-attacks

WASHINGTON, April 1 (AFP) - US Secretary of State Colin Powell has 
added a stop in Belgrade to his lightning trip to Ankara and Brussels 
to discuss the ongoing war in Iraq, senior State Department officials 
said Tuesday. Powell will make a brief stop in the Serbian capital 
on Wednesday en route from Turkey to Belgium to show US support for 
the country that was shaken last month by the assassination of Prime 
Minister Zoran Djindjic, the officials said. "He wants to pay his 
respects and re-affirm our commitment to emerging democracies like 
Serbia," one official told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding that 
the new stop would not change the rest of Powell's itinerary. After 
his talks in Ankara aimed at shoring up ties damaged by the Iraq crisis, 
Powell is due in Brussels for meetings with NATO and EU officials 
on Thursday to discuss post-war reconstruction efforts. A formal announcement 
of the Belgrade stop was expected later Tuesday from deputy State 
Department spokesman Philip Reeker, the officials said. Powell will 
be the highest-ranking US official and first secretary of state to 
visit Belgrade since the 1999 Kosovo conflict that eventually led 
to the downfall of former Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic. Djindjic, 
who was slain on March 12, was instrumental in the movement to oust 
Milosevic and later turned him over to the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) where the he is now on trial 
for war crimes. The Serbian Interior Ministry said Monday that Djindjic 
had been murdered by self-styled patriotic forces in Milosevic's name 
and there have been charges that the ex-leader's wife ordered the 
killing. Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, who disappeared in 2000 
just before her husband was ousted from power, has flatly denied the 
accusations. mvl/mac US-Serbia-Powell

Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov renewed his country's insistent 
calls for an end to war in Iraq on Tuesday during a meeting in Moscow 
with his Peruvian, Brazilian and Costa Rican counterparts. "We expressed 
the following coinciding points of view: military operations must 
end as quickly as possible with the minimum number of human victims," 
Peru's Foreign Minister Alan Vagnar told journalists after the meeting. 
Russia has been one of the staunchest opponents of the US-led war 
in Iraq, and helped lead efforts in the UN Security Council to resolve 
the crisis through diplomacy. Peru and Brazil have also come out in 
opposition to the military offensive to oust Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein, while the small Central American nation of Costa Rica is 
listed as a member of the US-led "coalition of the willing," although 
like most other members of that group it is not taking part in the 
fighting. "Russia and the countries of Latin America support reinforcing 
the role of the United Nations, the principles of international rights 
on whose basis all contentious questions must be solved, including 
acute international conflicts," Ivanov said. Ivanov has called for 
reforming the United Nations since efforts to reach a consensus on 
action in Iraq failed in early March. He has proposed increasing the 
the number of permanent members on the UN Security Council from five 
to 10 to include countries from Africa, Asia and other regions on 
the permanent council. "Russia and the troika of the Rio Group are 
in favor of reforming the United Nations and its Security Council 
to increase its efficiency in the interest of reinforcing international 
security and the struggle against new challenges, such as international 
terrorism and organized crime," Vagner said. The three foreign ministers 
from the Rio Group, which comprises 19 countries in Latin America 
and the Carribean, also met Russian President Vladimir Putin. vvl/me/bb/ds

MONS, Belgium, April 1 (AFP) - NATO will undergo a sea change to meet 
the challenges of the 21st century, starting with the deployment of 
a rapid reaction force with global reach, US General James Jones, 
commander of NATO forces in Europe, said on Tuesday. "It's obvious 
we're seeing a military metamorphosis of this alliance," Jones told 
reporters at NATO military headquarters in the Belgian town of Mons. 
NATO leaders agreed last November to create a rapid reaction force 
(NRF) ready to be deployed quickly for combat missions wherever needed 
and to be fully operational by 2006. Jones confirmed on Tuesday that 
the first elements of this force would be operational by the end of 
the year, a full year earlier than the planned launch date of October 
2004. "No one has called me in and said you should develop a global 
capability per se, but it clearly is something that is being discussed," 
Jones told reporters. "The NRF will probably have the capability to 
do those things that the alliance wishes it to do and if it's going 
to be in different parts of the world so be it, we will build it that 
way." Several NATO members are pushing for a greater role for the 
Alliance on the world stage, with some arguing for NATO intervention 
in Afghanistan and even in Iraq. Jones said earlier this month that, 
if called upon, the alliance was ready to play a role in leading the 
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). Meanhile, 
it emerged last month that the United States was studying a radical 
overhaul of its military presence in Europe that would replace its 
large garrison force and big Cold War-era bases with rotating, expeditionary 
forces. lb/ec/gk NATO-future
