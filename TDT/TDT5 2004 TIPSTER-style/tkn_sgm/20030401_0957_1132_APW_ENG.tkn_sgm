Authorities have foiled two recent Iraqi terror plots, including one 
by Iraqi diplomats allegedly planning to contaminate water supplies 
to Jordanian and U.S. troops on Jordan's desert border with Iraq, 
diplomats said Tuesday. The second one _ in which four Iraqis were 
arrested last week _ allegedly involved a plot to bomb a luxury hotel 
frequented by Americans and other Westerners, including about 70 journalists, 
the diplomats said on condition of anonymity. Jordanian Information 
Minister Mohammad Affash Adwan indicated there had been Iraqi attempts 
to undermine Jordan's security but refused to elaborate. ``This is 
purely a security matter which is being investigated and I can't discuss 
it further,'' Adwan told The Associated Press. The plot to contaminate 
water supplies involved Iraqi diplomats expelled March 23 from Jordan, 
the sources said. They said the water is pumped from Zarqa, 27 kilometers 
(17 miles) northeast of the Jordanian capital Amman, but refused to 
provide other details. Zarqa water plants feed distant villages in 
Jordan's eastern desert, where there are several army and air bases, 
including one near the Iraqi border where hundreds of U.S. soldiers 
are manning anti-missile batteries. The hotel involved in the second 
plot was identified by sources as the Grand Hyatt, where a small fire 
in one of the hotel's upper floors last week was blamed on an electrical 
short circuit. Hyatt officials only said they were unaware of a terror 
plot. Iraqi Embassy spokesman Jawad al-Ali declined comment to the 
AP. But he told Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo that the allegations 
were ``completely untrue'' and that Iraq was keen to preserve Jordan's 
security. Jordan said when it expelled five Iraqi diplomats that they 
had carried out actions ``incompatible'' with their diplomatic duties. 
The government later said two could stay, but the Iraqi embassy said 
all five had already left the country. Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher 
said the expulsions were ordered on ``security'' grounds. He and other 
government officials declined to elaborate, saying it was inappropriate 
to incite a public spat with Iraq as regional tension rose over the 
U.S. and British bombardment of Jordan's eastern neighbor. Early last 
month, U.S. officials said they had asked about 60 countries to expel 
300 Iraqis said to be undercover agents possibly poised to attack 
American interests overseas. Some of the 300 were operating as diplomats 
out of Iraqi embassies, U.S. officials said. Several countries expelled 
Iraqi diplomats then, citing spying accusations or their involvement 
in activities ``incompatible with their diplomatic status.'' After 
launching the war, the United States asked all countries to expel 
Iraqi diplomats and close their embassies. Few countries responded 
positively. Jordan denied its expulsions were related to the U.S. 
request. But the actions fueled tension with Iraq, which already had 
been suspicious of Jordan for allowing U.S. troops to be stationed 
near its border, despite Jordanian assertions that the ``several hundred'' 
Americans were in the kingdom only for defensive purposes. One day 
after the deportations, Jordanian authorities also detained four Iraqi 
transport officials for questioning. No details emerged from the interrogation, 
but officials said those four _ two employees with Iraqi Airways and 
two with a joint Jordanian-Iraqi transport company _ had been released. 
Four others arrested in connection with the hotel plot remain in custody. 
The diplomats declined to say when those arrests were made. Aware 
of strong anti-war sentiments among Jordanians, the government has 
been striving to distance itself from the conflict on Iraq _ supplier 
of all its oil needs at cheap prices. Trade with Iraq amounted to 
US$700 million last year, making it the largest importer of Jordanian 
goods. Jordan announced last week that oil from Iraq ceased on the 
first day of the war on March 20. Iraq blamed Jordan for the halted 
oil flow and accused the kingdom of blocking overland shipments of 
food and medicine. Jordan denied it, saying local exporters were concerned 
over road safety. ^ (jjh-pfg) &lt;

The United Nations should send human rights monitors to Iraq as soon 
as the security situation allows such a move, a U.N. expert said Tuesday, 
urging both sides in the war to shield civilians from the conflict. 
``I would go tomorrow if the circumstances allowed it,'' Andreas Mavrommatis 
told a session of the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission. ``There 
is a lot to be gained by a U.N. presence in Iraq in the future in 
the field of human rights.'' The Cypriot specialist presented a 15-page 
report on the rights situation in Iraq to the commission, which is 
currently holding its annual six-week session. The report, prepared 
before the start of the U.S.-led war, makes no direct reference to 
the conflict. But in his speech, Mavrommatis urged both sides to ``scrupulously 
observe international humanitarian law and shield the civilian population 
from the consequences of war.'' The office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Human Rights has appealed for US$1.6 million to send observers 
to Iraq ``when conditions permit,'' spokesman Jose Diaz said Tuesday. 
Mavrommatis renewed calls on Iraq to adopt a moratorium on executions, 
reduce the number of crimes which carry the death penalty and improve 
prison conditions. He also criticized discrimination against Iraq's 
Kurds and Shiite Muslims under Saddam Hussein's rule. Cooperation 
with Iraq was ``a slow, painstaking process,'' Mavrommatis said. Baghdad's 
replies to his questions and recommendations ``are at times incomplete 
and unsatisfactory.'' Mavrommatis was appointed in 1999 and visited 
the country in February 2002 at the invitation of Iraqi authorities. 
He planned a further visit earlier this year but said that ``unfolding 
events in Iraq forced me to postpone second visit to the country.'' 
Instead, he met with diplomats from Iraq's mission to U.N. European 
offices in Geneva on three occasions. Iraqi Ambassador Samir al-Nima 
said the report was influenced by ``unwarranted and unjustified political 
considerations,'' and failed to address violations by coalition forces 
attacking Iraq. He said Baghdad had cooperated properly with the U.N. 
expert but Mavrommatis relied too heavily on ``information from sources 
hostile to Iraq.'' Even as war loomed, Mavrommatis ``should have visited 
Iraq, to ensure his report was credible,'' al-Nima said. He and other 
U.N. human rights officials now ``must visit Iraq immediately to see 
for themselves the human rights violations perpetrated by the bloody 
hands of the invaders of the 21st century,'' the ambassador said. 
Mavrommatis told reporters later that he was ``steering clear of politics,'' 
but noted he had deplored both civilian losses and suicide bombings 
aimed at coalition forces. He said his relatively conciliatory approach 
toward Iraq _ struck in an attempt to enlist the cooperation of the 
Iraqi authorities _ had achieved some results, such as a general amnesty 
last October that freed 25,000 inmates after he urged the step as 
a way to ease appalling prison conditions.

Indian states missed the deadline Tuesday to switch over to a new 
tax system as traders, fearing it will squeeze their profits and pinch 
consumers, shut their shops in protest for a second day. The government 
wanted to introduce a value added tax, or VAT, to replace varying 
sales tax systems across India's 38 states and federal territories 
from Tuesday. But only 12 states have passed legislation to implement 
the system, and none have published the laws, which means they cannot 
take effect. Announcing the deadline in the Feb. 28 budget, Finance 
Minister Jaswant Singh said the new system would bring India in line 
with developed countries' tax rules. Singh had said the federal government 
would offset revenue losses by some states during the transition phase. 
But state governments worry that the new tax will anger traders, who 
are an influential lobby group and an important source of donations 
for political parties. ``VAT will subject traders to more harassment 
by tax officials,'' said Sham Behave Misra, a lawmaker from Prime 
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, who also heads 
the All India Traders' Federation. Under the new tax system, traders 
would be required to routinely submit details of their sales and the 
tax they pay to authorities. They would also have to pay tax up front 
and later seek refunds of any portion that was overpaid. Misra said 
that will give tax officials the leverage to harass traders and seek 
bribes. Government officials deny this, arguing that the present system 
helps tax-evading traders, who sell products for cash and don't keep 
receipt books. A Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, said the traders' fears were unfounded and many had 
protested without looking at details of the new tax system, which 
many states have not yet made public. Later on Tuesday, the ministry 
called a meeting of state finance ministers next week to resolve the 
deadlock.

Roberto Petagine drove in two runs including a solo homer to power 
the Yomiuri Giants Tuesday to a 5-0 win over the Yokohama BayStars. 
Petagine, acquired from the Yakult Swallows in the offseason, drove 
in the winning run on a sacrifice fly with bases loaded in the first 
inning at Tokyo Dome. He also belted a solo shot in the seventh _ 
his third consecutive homer in three games _ for the 2002 Japan Series 
champions. Masumi Kuwata, who gave up only four hits and struck out 
six over seven innings, picked up his first win this season. At Nagoya 
Dome, Alex Ramirez scored three RBIs, including a pair of home runs, 
as the Yakult Swallows beat the Chunichi Dragons at 9-4. Ramirez, 
formerly of the Pittsburgh Pirates, hit a solo homer in the third 
inning and a two-run blast in the sixth _ his first and second homer 
of the season. In Hiroshima, Keiichi Yabu gave up only two runs on 
four hits over seven innings as the Hanshin Tigers beat the Hiroshima 
Carp at 10-5. Lou Pote, formerly with the Anaheim Angels, held the 
Carp scoreless for the last two innings to pick up his first save 
this season. In the Pacific League, Roosevelt Brown drove in the winning 
run with a solo homer in the eighth inning to lead the Orix BlueWave 
to a 3-2 win over Seibu Lions, snapping the team's losing streak at 
four. It was Brown's first home run this season. Brown formerly played 
for the Chicago Cubs. Satoshi Tokumoto allowed only two runs over 
eight innings and chalked up his first win. Jun Hagiwara, coming in 
the ninth inning, got his first save this seson. In Chiba, Itsuki 
Shoda went 5 1/3 innings scoreless to pick up his first win this year 
as the Nippon Ham Fighters defeated the the Lotte Marines at 5-2. 
Angel Echevarria, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, belted a two-run 
blast _ his first home run this season _ in the sixth inning for the 
Fighters. At Yahoo BB, near Osaka, Yuji Yoshioka blasted a three-run 
homer to ignite a four-run first inning rally as the Kintetsu Buffaloes 
cruised to a 5-3 win over the Daiei Hawks. With the win, the Buffaloes 
extended their winning streak at five since last Friday's season opener. 
It was Yoshioka's second homer of the season.

In trying to agree on how to spend the billions of dollars President 
George W. Bush promised for a global fight against AIDS, Congress 
can't get past the basic questions like whether it's more important 
to advise people to abstain from sex or to give them condoms. The 
House International Relations Committee, set to vote Wednesday on 
a five-year, $15 billion AIDS package that should win support from 
both parties, is at odds with the White House on where the money should 
go. The Senate was still searching for a consensus approach, and AIDS 
funding advocates were not optimistic for success. In his State of 
the Union address to Congress in January, Bush asked for $15 billion 
over five years, including $10 billion in new money, to fight AIDS, 
particularly the epidemic in Africa. ``Seldom has history offered 
a greater opportunity to do so much for so many,'' he said. White 
House differences with Congress, however, have resulted in postponed 
votes in both the House International Relations Committee and its 
Senate counterpart in recent weeks. The House, led by committee chairman 
Henry Hyde, is seeking $3 billion a year and would funnel up to $1 
billion of that in the 2004 budget year to the Swiss-based, U.N.-backed 
Global Fund to Combat AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The White House 
has questioned the efficiency of the fund, even though it recently 
picked Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson as its chairman, 
and wants to give it only $200 million a year. The Global Fund gives 
money to the U.N. Population Fund, mistrusted by conservative groups 
because it supports groups that carry out or advise women about abortion. 
Hyde, a leader of anti-abortion lawmakers, has avoided that controversy 
so far by not including language, appearing in other foreign aid bills, 
that restricts aid to health and family planning groups that promote 
abortion. Conservative groups are not happy with that and also are 
intent on changing language in the bill dealing with condoms. The 
bill endorses the ``ABC'' approach that has had some success in Uganda, 
which stresses abstinence, being faithful and, when appropriate, condoms. 
But Connie Mackey of the Family Research Council said it doesn't go 
far enough toward making abstinence a priority over condom distribution. 
The Uganda experience, Mackey said, is proof of what works. ``We're 
hoping the bill will better reflect that,'' she said. Negotiators 
reportedly are considering language to make sure religious organizations 
that promote abstinence and oppose condom distribution will be eligible 
for AIDS funding. The House bill also ensures closer monitoring of 
the Global Fund and recommends that 55 percent of the money go to 
treatment, 15 percent to hospice care and 20 percent to prevention, 
with the rest for other purposes. In the Senate, Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairman Dick Lugar also has tried to find a consensus that 
would satisfy the White House, the conservatives and the Democrats. 
``It's going to take a little longer,'' Lugar's spokesman, Andy Fisher, 
said.

The Italian coast guard rescued 207 immigrants including 24 Iraqi 
refugees in an overloaded wooden boat south of Sicily, officials said 
Tuesday. Coast guard ships and a helicopter accompanied the 40-foot 
(12-meter) boat late Monday to the tiny island of Lampedusa, 210 kilometers 
(130 miles) southwest of Sicily. Twenty-two children were on board, 
some as young as eight months, port officials said. All the migrants 
were taken to a holding center on the island, except for a Somali 
man who was flown to a Palermo hospital to receive treatment for a 
hernia. The immigrants came from numerous countries, including Sudan, 
Ghana, Somalia and Iraq. The ANSA news agency said the boat had come 
from Turkey, and that the migrants had spent five days aboard. Officials 
would not immediately confirm the report. Thousands of migrants reach 
Italy every year, with many landing on Lampedusa, a desolate speck 
of an island closer to Africa than to Italy. (ic/tr)

Italian police have arrested four people _ one Egyptian, one Somali 
and two Iraqi Kurds _ who are suspected of having links with Islamic 
terrorist groups, anti-terrorism police said Tuesday. The arrests 
were sought by Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who has been leading 
investigations into suspected Islamic cells in Italy. Bruno Megale 
of Milan's anti-terrorism police confirmed the arrests but refused 
to say where or when the arrests were made or give other details, 
saying the probe was in progress. Italian dailies Corriere della Sera 
and La Repubblica, reporting on the arrests that were apparently carried 
out Monday evening, said the men were suspected of belonging to an 
extremist Islamic group based in northern Iraq and called Ansar al-Islam. 
U.S. officials believe that Ansar al-Islam, a tiny Kurdish group, 
is linked to al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's terror network. In a speech 
before the U.N. Security Council in February, U.S. Secretary of State 
Colin Powell said that bin Laden's man in Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, 
has set up a camp in a corner of northern Iraq controlled by Ansar 
al-Islam. Powell also said that Zarqawi and his network have plotted 
terrorist actions against several countries, including Italy. Judge 
Guido Salvini, in his written approval for the arrest warrants, said 
the four were providing men for the training camp in northern Iraq, 
while also helping militants passing through Italy sneak into other 
European countries, such as Germany and Britain, Ap.Biscom, an Italian 
news agency reported. Two of the suspects were reportedly picked up 
in Milan and two in Parma, another northern Italian city. They were 
planning to leave the country, the reports said. The reports also 
said that at least seven other people were being investigated as part 
of the same probe. Corriere said that before the arrests, the suspects' 
telephone conversations had been tapped for months. The suspects were 
charged with subversive association aimed at international terrorism, 
as well as with forging documents and aiding illegal immigration, 
RAI state TV said. Dambruoso could not be reached for comment. The 
arrests were the latest in a series of raids that have brought dozens 
of suspected terrorists behind bars in Italy. Many of those suspects 
were later released for lack of evidence. Late last month, Dambruoso 
asked an Italian judge to indict 61 Egyptian on charges of criminal 
association. The international terrorism charge was introduced in 
Italy only after the Sept. 11 attacks, and therefore could not be 
used against the defendants in the case, which dates back to 1995. 
Dambruoso alleges that the suspects have provided logistic support 
to two terrorist organizations based in Egypt, al-Jihad and al-Gama'a 
al-Islamiyya. (ar-fd)

Sri Lanka's chief cricket selector Guy de Alwis resigned Tuesday, 
alleging the country's sports minister was interfering in the team 
selection process. ``From the time we took over, it has been a battle 
(with the minister) after every tournament,'' Alwis, a former test 
wicketkeeper, told The Associated Press. Sports Minister Johnston 
Fernando last week refused to ratify a squad for the upcoming Sharjah 
Cup tournament, beginning in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, 
selected by the two-member selection panel which de Alwis heads. International 
teams require ministerial approval in Sri Lanka. The squad excluded 
middle-order batsmen Russel Arnold, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara, 
medium fast bowler Pulasthi Gunaratne and ace offspinner Muttiah Muralitharan. 
Fernando later appointed three more members to the selection committee 
who brought back Muralitharan and Sangakkara and left out all-rounders 
Hasantha Fernando and Thilan Samaraweera. ``We had already selected 
a squad and later had to keep away two boys. It's very wrong,'' de 
Alwis said, adding the decision would likely have shattered the hopes 
of youngsters Fernando and Samaraweera. He said while many teams around 
the world were tying to bring younger players into international teams, 
the minister wanted to continue with the older players. The sports 
minister was unavailable for comment Tuesday. However, a new member 
of the selection committee Aravinda de Silva said Monday that its 
policy was to combine youth and experience. The Sharjah Cup tournament, 
involving Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Kenya, is scheduled to 
begin Thursday. De Alwis said he will continue to work as a member 
of the cricket board's interim committee.

An explosion Tuesday in a chemical plant owned by the Dutch company 
DSM killed three people and wounded two, Dutch television reported. 
The plant was in the town of Geleen, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) 
south of Amsterdam. The precise cause of the explosion was not immediately 
known, but a municipal spokeswoman said it had occurred at 12:15 p.m. 
(1015 GMT) during welding repairs to a gas-powered boiler. Police 
and ambulances were summoned quickly to the scene, but town officials 
were only informed two hours later, said Geleen spokeswoman Bertie 
Bischops. ``There was an explosion and there are victims. I don't 
know how many, but there is no threat to the surrounding area,'' she 
said. No further details were available. Although the Netherlands 
has a substantial number of industrial manufacturers and chemical 
companies, fatal accidents are rare. The worst industrial accident 
in recent years was in May 2000, when 22 people were killed by an 
explosion at a fireworks storage depot in the eastern town of Enschede. 
DSM, a blue chip company on the Amsterdam stock exchange, makes coatings, 
resins and chemicals used to make plastics. (ad/am)

Nigerian labor groups called off a general strike shortly before it 
was to begin Tuesday. The Nigerian Labor Congress's announcement on 
state radio overnight eased some pressure on international oil prices, 
which have risen during unrelated ethnic violence in the oil-rich 
Niger Delta since March 12. The fighting has forced multinational 
firms to cut 800,000 barrels a day, or 40 percent of the 2 million 
barrels Nigeria produces daily. Congress leaders said they were postponing 
their work stoppage until after Nigeria's legislative and presidential 
elections on April 12 and 19. Some civil servants and other workers 
did not show up on the job Tuesday because they were unaware the strike 
had been called off, the state radio station reported. The labor grouping, 
which includes many blue-collar oil workers, is demanding higher salary 
and other perks. (gam-esh)

The winners of this year's French Open will earn more money than last 
year, but women will still make less than men. Total prize money is 
going up 6 percent to 13,044,055 million euros (US$14,211,497 at the 
current exchange rate), the French Tennis Federation said Tuesday. 
The men's champion will earn 840,000 euros (US$915,180), and the women's 
champ will earn 819,000 euros (US$892,300). The overall men's increase 
is 7.7 percent, compared to a 7.6 percent rise for women. The French 
Open, like Wimbledon, pays more prize money to men. At the other two 
Grand Slams, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open, the pay is equal. 
This year is the third consecutive year that prize money has increased 
at the French Open, which runs May 26-June 8. The purse is up from 
12,294,705 euros in 2002. (parf-jg-eg)

the impact of falling stock markets on the company. The reason isn't 
so much in Munich Re's basic business of selling backup coverage to 
insurance companies, which analysts say is turning around. Much of 
the headache comes from the German tradition in which the country's 
big businesses own large chunks of each other. Munich Re, which is 
the world's largest reinsurer, has seen its shares slide rapidly since 
it announced last week that 5.7 billion euros (US$6.2 billion) in 
losses on stakes in other companies had sapped its earnings. That 
started a spiral of bad news, as ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors 
lowered Munich Re's financial-strength rating and investors sold off 
the stock. It traded at around 55 euros (US$59) Tuesday _ down more 
than 30 percent from just under 82 euros before last week's announcement, 
and down 86 percent from its peak of 387 euros in 2001. Munich Re 
owns 25 percent in struggling HVB bank, which lost 858 million euros 
(US$927 million) last year, and 20 percent in primary insurer Allianz, 
which lost 1.2 billion euros (US$1.4 billion) and owns Dresdner Bank. 
Dresdner Bank reported a 1.4 billion euro (US$1.6 billion) loss for 
2002. In addition, Munich Re owns 10.4 percent of lossmaking Commerzbank, 
the country's fourth largest. All invest heavily in stocks and have 
been victims of the current bear market on their own terms. But the 
crossed shareholdings makes trouble contagious, since when one stock 
falls, the other companies' shares _ and subsequently their earnings 
_ suffer along with it. ``The connection between Allianz, HVB and 
Munich is particularly bad,'' said analyst Ralf Dibbern at M.M. Warburg 
in Hamburg. ``Every time one goes down, the others follow, that's 
the problem.'' The bank's troubles and falling stock markets have 
proved bigger financial trouble for Munich Re than the Sept. 11, 2001 
terror attacks, which cost it 2.6 billion euros in damage claims spread 
over two years _ but only dented the stock price briefly. Munich Re 
says it will seek to replenish its finances with a bond issue, the 
size of which is still being decided as the company tests institutional 
investors' appetite this week with presentations in Paris, Amsterdam, 
London and Frankfurt. But some investors fear Munich Re may be forced 
to do what Allianz did last week _ announce it would increase its 
capital by issuing new shares. Shareholders hate that because it dilutes 
the value of their holdings. The company says it won't. ``There is 
no question of a capital increase,'' said spokesman Florian Woest. 
Ironically, the crash in the company's stock price comes as some think 
its basic business is turning around. After the huge losses of Sept. 
11, Munich Re and other reinsurers took steps to lessen their dependence 
on stock market gains by raising prices and capping coverage. ``I 
am positive on their underwriting business,'' said Warburg analyst 
Dibbern. Munich Re had net profit of 1.1 billion euros (US$1.3 billion) 
but would have shown a loss without one-time gains from 4.7 billion 
from selling part of its stake in Allianz and its subsidiaries. Reinsurers 
have in essence two businesses: collecting premiums and paying claims, 
and the potentially more lucrative _ but unpredictable _ investment 
of premium proceeds on stock markets. Further sudden drops in the 
stock market could mean trouble, Dibbern said: ``That's another matter 
_ if equity markets fall another 20 percent, then the situation is 
different.'' In addition, Munich Re and Allianz plan to cut their 
stakes in each other to 15 percent _ below the 20 percent threshold 
where they must show their share of the other's losses in their earnings, 
and lessening some of the vicious circle's effect. (dm-cb)

A 72-year-old man who fell ill after returning from the Far East is 
suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome, a hospital said 
Tuesday, confirming the fourth case in Germany so far. The patient 
has largely recovered and does not appear to have infected others, 
according to the clinic near the western city of Dortmund where he 
is being treated. The man was one of several patients put into isolation 
wards in Germany to guard against a spread of the mystery illness 
that has infected some 1,600 people worldwide, mostly in Asia, killing 
more than 60. Tests at a laboratory in Hamburg confirmed that the 
man, who was not identified, was suffering from the virus after returning 
from a trip to Singapore and Vietnam two weeks ago, the hospital said. 
Three patients from Singapore being treated for SARS at a Frankfurt 
clinic since March 15 also are expected to make a full recovery, doctors 
said last week. The three, including a doctor who had treated SARS 
patients in Singapore, were taken off a New York-Singapore flight 
in Frankfurt. Elsewhere, German authorities are carrying out tests 
on a 62-year-old man suspected of having contracted the illness on 
a trip to China and Hong Kong. The patient is under quarantine at 
a Munich hospital. Tests are expected to show Wednesday whether a 
man hospitalized in Mannheim has SARS, and officials said Tuesday 
that a woman from the western city of Neuss has been quarantined in 
her home with symptoms of the illness after a trip to Vietnam. Tests 
have shown several other suspected cases in Germany to be false alarms. 
On Tuesday, passengers were only allowed to leave a flight to Duesseldorf 
from Dubai after a doctor concluded that a 21-month-old child who 
developed a fever during the flight was not infected with the virus.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will visit Indian-controlled Kashmir 
this month to a get a firsthand feel of the situation in the insurgency-ridden 
state, a government official said Tuesday. Vajpayee will spend two 
days in Jammu-Kashmir state in the third week of April, the official 
said on condition of anonymity. Citing security concerns, the official 
did not give any specific dates. The prime minister will review security 
in the state, where more than a dozen Islamic militant groups have 
been fighting for its independence from India, or its merger with 
mostly Muslim Pakistan. Vajpayee was also expected to announce more 
financial aid to the state's newly elected government, which says 
it wants to fight militancy by offering jobs and economic incentives 
to people of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state. The 
visit comes two years after Vajpayee announced a special 62 billion-rupee 
(US$1.3 billion) long-term development package for Jammu-Kashmir. 
The prime minister is also expected to inaugurate the North-South 
Corridor _ an ambitious road project that will connect Srinagar, the 
state's summer capital, with Kanyakumari located on the southern tip 
of India, the official said.

Henry Racamier, who took charge of family-owned leather company Louis 
Vuitton at age 65 and transformed it into a luxury goods giant, has 
died. He was 90. Racamier died on Saturday of a heart attack while 
traveling in Sardinia, according to a statement by the National Opera 
of Paris, which Racamier backed for years. Racamier, born in 1912 
in Pont-de-Roide, France, had already made his fortune as founder 
and director of a stainless steel company when he took over at Louis 
Vuitton in 1977. The businessman's wife, Odile Vuitton, was a descendant 
of Louis Vuitton. The family-run business, founded in 1854, had only 
two exclusive shops in France when Racamier took over. Over the next 
13 years, Racamier modernized factories and made acquisitions that 
turned the company into one of the globe's leading luxury goods groups, 
with 140 shops worldwide. In 1987, he merged his company with French 
spirits, champagne and perfume group Moet Hennessy. Racamier, however, 
was forced out of the group in 1990 over heated disagreements over 
company control and other issues with financier Bernard Arnault. Racamier 
was well-known as a patron of the arts. In 1986, he founded the Louis 
Vuitton Foundation for the Opera, Music and the Arts. From 1995 to 
1999, he served as president of an association that raises funds for 
the National Opera of Paris. Racamier is survived by his wife and 
two twin daughters, Caroline Bentz and Laurence Fontaine. (jc-jg)

Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni on Tuesday confronted suspected members 
of a Greek terror group accused of murdering her husband and described 
them as ``cowardly killers.'' Bakoyianni is the latest Greek politician 
to testify against alleged members of the far-left group November 
17, who went on trial on March 3 for 23 murders, dozens of bombings 
and scores of armed robberies. The mayor's late husband, Pavlos Bakoyiannis, 
a journalist and ranking member of Greece's center-right New Democracy 
party, was shot dead in 1989 outside his Athens office. She remarried 
in 1998. Turning to the suspects in court Tuesday, Bakoyianni described 
them as ``unmanly and cowardly killers, low-quality human beings ... 
with no genuine political motives.'' November 17 is named after a 
student revolt in 1973 that helped topple a dictatorship the following 
year. The group is accused of killing four American officials, diplomats 
from Britain and Turkey, as well as Greek politicians, leading businessmen 
and senior judges. The group eluded police from 1975 until it was 
exposed last year by a bungled bomb attack. Nineteen suspects _ 18 
men and one woman _ are on trial. Nine defendants have so far been 
identified in witness testimony as participating in attacks. Bakoyianni, 
49, began her career in politics after her husband's murder. She was 
elected mayor in a landslide victory last year. (str/dg/pq)

The German government advised Tuesday against trips to parts of the 
Sahara Desert in Algeria after a fourth group of tourists went missing 
in the region. The six tourists from Bavaria who were traveling by 
car in southern Algeria were reported missing at the weekend, bringing 
the total number of missing Europeans to 17. In an update on its Web 
site, the Foreign Ministry said travelers should avoid ``at all costs'' 
the area around Tamanrasset, where the group was last seen, as well 
as a route between the towns of Illizi and Hadjadj. ``Criminal bands 
and smugglers present an increased security risk,'' near Algeria's 
porous borders with Niger and Mali, it said, urging travelers to use 
experienced travel firms if they decide to go ahead. A ministry spokesman 
said Algerian authorities also have found no trace of three groups 
who disappeared in the Algerian Sahara in February. Helicopters and 
four-wheel-drive vehicles were used to search for six Germans, one 
Dutch citizen and four Swiss travelers. The spokesman, speaking on 
customary condition of anomymity, said a German police liaison officer 
had arrived in Algeria Monday to boost efforts by the German Embassy 
in Algiers to find the missing tourists. Swiss authorities say their 
citizens last called relatives from Illizi on Feb. 20. (swg-gm)

The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein should make the sacrifice of stepping down if it would end 
the war. ``If the only thing remaining to resolve the situation in 
Iraq is a sacrifice from President Saddam Hussein and since he's asking 
all Iraqis to sacrifice their lives for their country, then the least 
that can be expected is that he would do the same and sacrifice for 
his country,'' Prince Saud said. Saud said he was not calling on or 
urging Saddam to step down. But asked whether it was too late for 
such a move from the Iraqi leader, who has pledged never to resign, 
said: ``Why should it be too late?'' Saud's remarks appeared to be 
a signal to Saddam that the exile option is still open. In a joint 
interview before the war started with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat 
daily newspaper and Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal satellite television, Saud 
was quoted as saying that the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved 
had Saddam accepted a proposal by the United Arab Emirates urging 
him to step down and go into exile. The prince's remarks then were 
the closest Saudi Arabia had come to endorsing the idea. Saud said 
a U.S. ``military occupation'' of Iraq would not resolve the Iraq 
conflict and called for a cease-fire to allow diplomacy to work. ``Conflict 
is not really the best way to resolve disputes,'' said Saud. ``Let 
us stop it now before hatred grips our hearts and our souls.'' He 
said one of the reasons the kingdom is against the war ``is because 
wars tend to spread and especially wars in areas that have chronic 
problems like the Middle East.'' ``We are afraid of the spread of 
war,'' said Saud. Saud also lashed out at unnamed U.S. ``prognosticators 
and advisers who have covered the wave lengths of all media stations'' 
for giving the impression that Washington intends to change the geopolitical 
map in the region, feeding Arab fears that Iraq is the first U.S. 
step toward controlling the area. Saud, a graduate of Princeton University, 
said it is ``not within the character of the United States, at least 
not the United States that I know,'' to do that, adding that U.S. 
President George W. Bush and his government are ``talking a different 
language.'' ``This is creating great confusion that exists in the 
Arab world about the motives of the United States,'' added Saud. ``I 
think and this country thinks, as a friend of the United States, that 
this image must change and the true nature of the American people 
should emerge from this fog that was created by these few individuals.'' 
Saud said his country will work hard to maintain the relations the 
kingdom has had with the United States for more than six decades, 
saying ``it's not something easy to dispense with this friendship.'' 
Saud said ``there was no permission asked and no permission given 
for overflying'' Tomahawk cruise missiles through Saudi airspace. 
Four of the missiles that have missed their targets on their flight 
paths to Iraq have landed in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. military has agreed 
to temporarily suspend Tomahawk launches from the eastern Mediterranean 
Sea and the Red Sea. Saudi Arabia, fearful of an internal, Muslim 
extremist backlash, has been quiet about its support for the U.S. 
military strikes on Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, the use of Saudi territory 
by U.S. troops as a launch pad against Iraq produced a cause for al-Qaida 
leader Osama bin Laden to rally militants. ^ da/db &lt;

Lambasted for scoring only two goals against soccer minnow Liechtenstein, 
England's stars will be thankful to get a lucky 1-0 victory over World 
Cup semifinalist Turkey on Wednesday. It might not be enough to get 
the critics off their backs. But it will mean moving to the top of 
the group standings and getting back on course for a place in next 
year's European Championship finals. Team captain David Beckham said 
facing Group 7 leader Turkey at Sunderland's Stadium of Light is England's 
biggest game since last year's World Cup in Japan. ``All the players 
know it is,'' he said. ``Obviously we've had some big games since 
then but none as big as this. ``It's the biggest game of the group 
now. They've been playing well, they're top of the group, they've 
got nothing to lose. It's up to us to beat them and get the three 
points. ``We've got to respond,'' the Manchester United star said. 
``There are critics out there and we want to show them we are capable 
of beating this team.'' If England produces a repeat of Saturday's 
tepid 2-0 performance against Liechtenstein it will be unlikely to 
defeat a high quality Turkish team that has virtually all its World 
Cup stars. The squad includes standout goalkeeper Rustu Recber of 
Fenerbahce, Galatasaray's attacking midfielder Hasan Sas, Inter Milan's 
Emre Belozoglu and English-based players Alpay Ozalan (Aston Villa), 
Tugay Kerimoglu and Hakan Sukur (both Blackburn Rovers). A Turkish 
victory would give the World Cup third-place team a five point advantage 
at the top of the group and leave England realistically looking at 
a place in the runners-up playoffs. Beckham knows the Turks are no 
longer the pushovers who have never beaten or even scored against 
England in eight meetings, including two 8-0 thrashings at Istanbul 
(1984) and Wembley ('87). Their last meeting was almost exactly 10 
years ago in a World Cup qualification game in Izmir. England won 
2-0. ``Football has changed,'' Beckham said. ``But we need not to 
concede any goals and hopefully score a lot of them.'' As well as 
needing the victory to keep alive its chances of an automatic berth 
in the finals, England's stars may be playing for Sven-Goran Eriksson's 
job. The England coach has been a target for major criticism from 
the media for England's poor performances since the World Cup. An 
unconvincing 2-1 win in Slovakia was followed by a 2-2 tie at home 
to modest Macedonia in another Euro 2004 qualifying game. Then came 
the embarrassment of a 3-1 loss at home to Australia at West Ham's 
Upton Park in a friendly in February. Eriksson has been blamed not 
only for the results but for taking the passion out of England's play. 
The papers say the Swede's low-key, detached personality appears to 
have been passed on to the players. ``If you want someone shouting 
you have to change because that's never been my style,'' Eriksson 
told reporters on Tuesday. ``At my age it's not easy and I have no 
intention to change my character. I couldn't do it.'' The papers have 
also given him plenty of advice on his best lineup and best tactical 
formation against the Turks. Eriksson has to decide whether to start 
17-year-old Everton striker Wayne Rooney for the first time, stick 
with the Liverpool combination of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey, move 
Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes forward to partner Owen 
or leave the Liverpool man on his own in a 4-5-1 formation. Whatever 
his selection, Eriksson, who has Arsenal centerback Sol Campbell back 
after an Achilles tendon injury, knows victory is vital. ``All of 
our players know this is a really big game. We can't fail if we want 
to win the group,'' he said. Eriksson said he was aware of the criticism 
aimed at him and the team after the drab performance in Liechtenstein. 
``I read some of the papers and it would have been better not to,'' 
he said. ``We took three points, a professional job done. I know we 
can play better football of course but let's try to do that tomorrow.'' 
Eriksson acknowledged that Turkey had made big advances in world soccer. 
``You can't compare them with the Turkey of 15 years ago, they are 
one of the countries making the most progress in the world,'' he said. 
Turkish coach Senol Gunes, whose team has maintained its World Cup 
form by winning all three Euro 2004 games so far, compared his team's 
rise with England's performances in major championships. ``We have 
improved a lot,'' he said. ``We were quarterfinalists at Euro 2000 
and we also came third in the World Cup in 2002. England couldn't 
qualify for the quarterfinals at Euro 2000 and lost to Brazil in the 
quarterfinals of the World Cup. ``But this doesn't guarantee that 
we will win this game. The success we have had in these two competitions 
does not matter, neither will the record of English teams against 
Turkey in the past guarantee that they will win. ``Previously we haven't 
scored against England and we have only one point,'' Gunes said. ``But 
we always look to the future.'' Police and security staff are expecting 
a tough night. English and Turkish fans are known for sparking violence 
and, of the 4,000 tickets sold to the Turkish contingent, some may 
have gone to Kurdish asylum seekers opposed to the Turkish government. 
Up to 4,000 police officers will be on duty at the ground and in the 
city center. Expected lineups: England _ David James, Gary Neville, 
Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Bridge, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, 
Steven Gerrard, Kieron Dyer, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey. Turkey _ 
Rustu Recber, Fatih Akyel, Alpay Ozalan, Bulent Korkmaz, Emre Belozoglu, 
Umit Davala, Okan Buruk, Tugay Kerimoglu, Hasan Sas, Nihat Kahveci, 
Ilhan Mansiz. (rjm)

Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday 
for the most eagerly awaited arguments of the session: two cases that 
could rewrite rules for affirmative action. The court was hearing 
back-to-back arguments asking how and whether race can be a factor 
when public colleges and universities choose their students. More 
broadly, the cases stemming from the University of Michigan's admissions 
policies ask wrenching legal and constitutional questions about equality, 
fairness, opportunity and U.S. history. The court's ruling, expected 
by July, could effectively end any state-sponsored affirmative action, 
or it could rewrite the rules for when race may be a factor in government 
decisions. The last time the court visited the issue was 25 years 
ago, in University of California v. Bakke. That fractured ruling struck 
down quota systems but left some room for race to be a factor in university 
admissions. Michigan and its law school give extra credit to minority 
applicants, making it more likely that a black, Hispanic or Native 
American will edge out a white applicant who has similar test scores, 
grades or other attributes. More than 100 friend of the court filings 
rolled in during the weeks preceding arguments. Lawyers could not 
remember another case that generated more. In another sign of the 
case's importance, the high court will release an audio tape immediately 
after the two-hour arguments. It is only the second time the court 
has done so. The first time was the presidential election cases in 
2000. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader, was among speakers 
outside the court Tuesday , where the large crowd was decidedly pro-affirmative 
action. ``There are more blacks in prison than in college. Young America, 
fight back,'' Jackson said. Many people bore signs and chanted slogans 
supporting affirmative action. ``They say Jim Crow, we say hell no,'' 
one group of demonstrators chanted. Jim Crow laws discriminate against 
blacks. The term comes from an 18th century Kentucky plantation song. 
Police barricaded the plaza and steps in front of the court, keeping 
protesters on the sidewalk. ``Affirmative action helped me, and I'm 
here to support students from all over the country,'' said Rosa Clemente 
of New York City. ``The Supreme Court needs to do the right thing 
and support affirmative action,'' added Clemente, who described herself 
as a ``black Puerto Rican'' with degrees from the State University 
of New York at Albany and Cornell University. The University of Michigan 
and its supporters contend that a diverse student body is a worthy 
goal that benefits all students. Government, in this case a public-funded 
university, has what the Supreme Court has called a compelling interest 
in furthering that goal, the school argues. Three white students who 
challenged the Michigan policies frame their argument in stark terms: 
It is not fair for a student to win a coveted place on campus just 
because he or she is a minority. ``I was treated unfairly because 
of my skin color,'' said Jennifer Gratz, a white student rejected 
by the university. ``Court records show that if I had been black, 
Hispanic or Native American, I would have had a nearly 100 percent 
chance of admission with my grades and record.'' The cases directly 
address only admissions at public, tax-supported institutions, but 
the court's rationale is expected to have a wide ripple through private 
colleges and universities, other government decision-making and the 
business world

Balinese Hindus ushered in their holiest day by torching a giant effigy 
of a key suspect in last year's deadly terrorist bombings _ along 
with dozens of other ``demons'' _ as part of a ceremony to banish 
evil from the island. Amrozi, who will soon go on trial for his alleged 
role in the attack that killed 202 people, was depicted carrying several 
sticks of dynamite attached to a timer. He was dressed in prison uniform. 
``He was under the influence of an evil spirit,'' said Ida Bagus, 
one of several people who spent months constructing the stunningly 
realistic seven-meter-high (seven-yard-high) model from bamboo and 
papier mache. The evil spirit ``Butakala'' is depicted standing on 
the shoulders of Amrozi, who like many Indonesians goes by a single 
name. On Tuesday evening, hundreds of people paraded through the crowded 
streets of Denpasar with hundreds of models known as ``ogok ogok'', 
some with contemporary figures like Amrozi and others representing 
traditional demons and monsters from Balinese mythology. The effigies 
then were burned in ceremonies meant to drive evil sprits from the 
island. Priests also make sacrifices and lead prayers at town squares 
and temples. Many burned the models in cemeteries and Amrozi's likeness 
went up in flames in the nearby village of Sanur to the cheers from 
a frenzied crowd. Bali is overwhelmingly Hindu, unlike the rest of 
Muslim-dominated Indonesia. On Wednesday, the island celebrates Nyepi, 
or Day of Silence, when most Balinese refrain from going out, making 
noise or using electricity, and spend the day mediating or praying. 
Tourists visiting the island are asked not to leave their hotels and 
the airport is closed until Thursday morning. International flights 
passing over Bali are rerouted for the day. Nyepi is a national holiday 
throughout Indonesia, which has a secular government and significant 
Christian and Buddhist minorities. The Oct. 12 bombings hit Bali's 
thriving tourist industry hard. Thousands of hotel workers have been 
laid off and most restaurants and souvenir shops are struggling to 
stay afloat. Tourist arrivals have picked up slightly over the past 
months, but are still way down on what they were before the attack. 
Amrozi was the first of 29 suspects arrested over the bombings, the 
worst terror attacks since the Sept. 11 strikes on the United States. 
Most of the victims were Western tourists. Police say Amrozi bought 
the minivan used in the attack and delivered the explosives. He has 
told reporters he carried out the attack to avenge the oppression 
of Muslims around the world.

identified in witness testimony as participating in attacks. Bakoyianni, 
49, began her career in politics after her husband's murder. She was 
elected mayor in a landslide victory last year. (str/dg/pq/tr)

Salman Khan, one of India's top movie stars, on Tuesday laughed over 
rival film actor Vivek Oberoi's allegation that Khan threatened his 
life. ``I have nothing to say about his allegations,'' Khan, 38, told 
The Associated Press, as he laughed uproariously over his cellphone 
about Oberoi's claim that Khan had repeatedly threatened to kill him. 
Oberoi said he had not filed any charges with police against Khan, 
known for his tough guy roles, but insisted he was threatened. ``He 
said he'd kill me. ... He called me 41 times in one night,'' Oberoi, 
27, said in a press conference broadcast on major Indian television 
channels Tuesday. Oberoi gave no motive for why Khan would threaten 
him, but said he would take legal action if Khan called again. Oberoi, 
a rising star in the Indian film industry, called Bollywood, has appeared 
in four Hindi language movies. He won rave reviews for his latest, 
``Dum'' or ``Strength,'' in which he played an average man who fights 
a corrupt police officer with mob links. Khan, a popular muscle-bound 
star, has appeared in some 20 blockbuster Hindi movies. His ratings 
took a beating after he was charged with culpable homicide, and drunken 
and reckless driving last October for the death of one man and injuries 
to three others when his car swerved onto a Bombay sidewalk. Khan 
has denied he was behind the wheel. If convicted he could be jailed 
up to 10 years.

NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. defense officials in Washington said Tuesday 
it is asking Fox News Channel to remove a reporter from a posting 
with U.S. troops in Iraq where he was accused of disclosing unauthorized 
information. The network agreed to remove former talk show host Geraldo 
Rivera, Lt. Col. Dave Lapan said. ``We have asked that he be removed 
and we are working with them to make that happen,'' he said. Fox News 
Channel executives did not immediately return calls seeking comment 
Tuesday. Earlier, Rivera had dismissed reports that he had been ejected 
from Iraq for revealing tactical information about the 101st Airborne 
Division. Also Tuesday, a British tabloid said it has hired Peter 
Arnett, who was dismissed by NBC television Monday for giving an unauthorized 
interview to Iraqi state television in which he said the American-led 
war effort initially failed because of Iraq's resistance. ``Fired 
by America for telling the truth,'' the Daily Mirror said in a Page 
1 headline. Lapan said Rivera reported details of troop operations 
by drawing a line in the sand showing where his unit was and where 
it was going next. Reporters who are ``embedded'' with U.S. troops 
are not supposed to disclose details that could help Iraqis figure 
out their location and plans. Rivera, Lapan said, was put with his 
unit as a ``short-term embed,'' meaning the military agreed he could 
go for a couple of days. Fox's rivals, CNN and MSNBC television, both 
reported Monday that Rivera had been kicked out of the country. Shortly 
thereafter, Rivera delivered a report via satellite phone saying he 
was 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Baghdad. Rivera labeled reports 
of his ouster ``a pack of lies.'' Arnett apologized Monday for his 
``misjudgment'' in talking to Iraqi TV. But he added: ``I said over 
the weekend what we all know about this war.'' Arnett, who won a Pulitzer 
Prize reporting in Vietnam for The Associated Press, gained much of 
his prominence from covering the 1991 Gulf War for CNN. NBC was angered 
because Arnett gave the interview Sunday without permission and presented 
opinion as fact. The network initially backed him, but reversed field 
after watching a tape of his appearance. The network said it got ``thousands'' 
of e-mails and phone calls protesting Arnett's remarks. In the interview, 
shown by Iraq's satellite television, Arnett said the United States 
was reappraising the battlefield and delaying the war, maybe for a 
week, ``and rewriting the war plan. The first war plan has failed 
because of Iraqi resistance. Now they are trying to write another 
war plan.'' Arnett said it was clear that, within the United States, 
opposition to the war was growing, along with a challenge to U.S. 
President George W. Bush about the war's conduct. The London newspaper 
that hired him, the Mirror, is vehemently opposed to the war. ``I 
am still in shock and awe at being fired,'' Arnett wrote for the newspaper.

An explosion Tuesday in a chemical plant owned by the Dutch company 
DSM killed three people and wounded two, a company official said. 
The plant in the town of Geleen, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) 
south of Amsterdam, produces melamine, a chemical component of plastics. 
A spokeswoman, who spoke on the condition on anonymity, could not 
confirm Dutch television reports that three others were missing. The 
precise cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but a municipal 
spokeswoman said it had occurred at 12:15 p.m. (1015 GMT) during repairs 
with a welder to a gas-powered boiler. Police and ambulances were 
summoned quickly to the scene, but town officials were only informed 
two hours later, said Geleen spokeswoman Bertie Bischops. ``There 
was an explosion and there are victims. I don't know how many, but 
there is no threat to the surrounding area,'' she said. No further 
details were available. Although the Netherlands has a substantial 
number of industrial manufacturers and chemical companies, fatal accidents 
are rare. The worst industrial accident in recent years was in May 
2000, when 22 people were killed by an explosion at a fireworks storage 
depot in the eastern town of Enschede. DSM, a blue chip company on 
the Amsterdam stock exchange, makes coatings, resins and chemicals 
used in plastics. It employs 20,000 people 40 countries, mainly in 
Europe and North America. Melamine is a fire-resistant, powdery substance 
used to make kitchen countertops, protective coatings on currency, 
car paint and dinner plates. (ad/am)

Sri Lanka's chief cricket selector Guy de Alwis resigned Tuesday, 
alleging the country's sports minister was interfering in the team 
selection process. ``From the time we took over, it has been a battle 
(with the minister) after every tournament,'' Alwis, a former test 
wicketkeeper, told The Associated Press. Sports Minister Johnston 
Fernando last week refused to ratify a squad for the upcoming Sharjah 
Cup tournament, beginning in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, 
selected by the two-member selection panel which de Alwis heads. International 
teams require ministerial approval in Sri Lanka. The squad excluded 
middle-order batsmen Russel Arnold, Mahela Jayawardena and Kumar Sangakkara, 
medium fast bowler Pulasthi Gunaratne and ace offspinner Muttiah Muralitharan. 
Fernando later appointed three more members to the selection committee 
who brought back Muralitharan and Sangakkara and left out all-rounders 
Hasantha Fernando and Thilan Samaraweera. ``We had already selected 
a squad and later had to keep away two boys. It's very wrong,'' de 
Alwis said, adding the decision would likely have shattered the hopes 
of youngsters Fernando and Samaraweera. He said while many teams around 
the world were tying to bring younger players into international teams, 
the minister wanted to continue with the older players. The sports 
minister was unavailable for comment Tuesday. However, a new member 
of the selection committee Aravinda de Silva said Monday that its 
policy was to combine youth and experience. The Sharjah Cup tournament, 
involving Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Kenya, is scheduled to 
begin Thursday. De Alwis said he will continue to work as a member 
of the cricket board's interim committee.

Two Iraqi soldiers who said they were sent on a suicide attack mission 
to the country's largest port have turned themselves in to British 
troops, the British commander said Tuesday. ``We had two suicide bombers 
turn themselves in yesterday because they didn't want to be suicide 
bombers any more,'' Col. Steve Cox, commander of the Royal Marine 
Commandos running Umm Qasr, told reporters. ``We are accommodating 
them.'' The pair had no explosives in their possession when they surrendered, 
Cox said, adding that they were turned over to British military intelligence 
for interrogation and would be treated as enemy prisoners of war. 
He did not give any details about the alleged plans for a suicide 
attack. Coalition forces have been on heightened alert for suicide 
attackers since one posing as a taxi driver detonated a bomb that 
killed four U.S. Army soldiers Saturday at a checkpoint farther north. 
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan pledged more suicide attacks 
would follow and called Saturday's ``just the beginning.'' Iraq has 
said thousands of Arab volunteers ready for martyrdom have come to 
Iraq since the start of the war. Umm Qasr is one of the few fully 
pacified towns inside Iraq and is vital to supplying the rest of the 
country with humanitarian aid because it is the only large seaport. 
Local Iraqis are increasingly informing British sources of the whereabouts 
of officials from Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party, Cox said. Thirty-five 
party officials are in custody, and three to four more remain at large, 
Cox said. The town of 30,000 people was plagued by pockets of resistance 
until several days ago, but is now safe enough for troops and ordinary 
civilians to walk around at night, Cox said. He added that there has 
been no recent guerrilla activity.

The once-powerful Gulf drug cartel has been nearly dismantled after 
the arrest of its leader, Osiel Cardenas, and the man believed to 
be his successor, Mexican prosecutors said. Victor Manuel Vazquez, 
who officials believe would have replaced Cardenas, was arrested Friday 
along with seven other people while drinking in the port city of Veracruz, 
anti-drug prosecutor Jose Luis Santiago said in a news conference 
Monday. Two weapons and four vehicles were seized by officials. Cardenas 
was arrested March 14 during a shootout with police in the border 
city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. The recent arrests 
assure that the Gulf cartel ``is practically dismantled,'' Santiago 
said, adding that recent intelligence reports by police indicate the 
Gulf cartel is having financial and leadership problems. Based in 
northeastern Mexico, the Gulf cartel was the strongest of the border-based 
drug organizations until 1996, when then-leader Juan Garcia Abrego 
was sentenced in Houston to 11 life terms for drug smuggling. Since 
taking office in December 2000, President Vicente Fox has focused 
on crippling the country's powerful drug trade, and police have responded 
by arresting or killing several high-profile drug lords. Among them 
were Ramon Arellano Felix, who was fatally shot by police a year ago 
in the Pacific resort of Mazatlan, and his brother Benjamin, who was 
arrested a few weeks later at his home in Puebla, 65 miles (105 kms) 
southeast of Mexico City.

Business at American factories pulled back in March for the first 
time in five months as the start of the war in Iraq caused new orders 
to manufacturers to plunge, according to a new survey. The Institute 
for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 46.2, slipping 
from February's 50.5 reading. A reading below 50 means manufacturing 
activity is contracting. Analysts had expected the war to cut into 
manufacturing, though not by this much. They had forecast that the 
index would fall to 49. The ISM, a private business group, said purchasing 
and supply executives focused on the war, soft demand and rising prices. 
The war appears to have slowed demand in a number of industries, including 
chemicals and industrial equipment, the survey said. ``March wasn't 
a good month for manufacturing, as the sector appears to have lost 
its momentum,'' said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the survey. New 
orders had been above the key 50 mark for six months, but dropped 
sharply in March to 46.2 percent. That's 6.1 percentage points lower 
than February's reading. Employment in the manufacturing sector failed 
again to recover in March, coming in below 50 for the 30th consecutive 
month. The index registered 42.1 percent last month. The ISM's production 
index fell 9.1 percentage points in March to 46.3 percent _ below 
the key 50 mark _ indicating a drop in business and ending 15 straight 
months of growth in production, the survey found. ``Supply managers 
continue to be challenged by business conditions,'' Ore said. ``The 
start of the war will begin to bring clarity to a difficult situation. 
In many ways, the threat of war was more intimidating than the actualization.'' 
The ISM's index is closely followed by economists and market watchers 
because it gives an early reading on the health of the manufacturing 
sector. Manufacturers continued to see higher prices cutting into 
their bottom line last month. The ISM's prices index was up for a 
13th month, with higher costs in energy, gasoline, paper and chemicals. 
Of the 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, only eight reported 
growth, including apparel, food, and wood and wood products. The index 
is based on a survey of managers who buy raw materials for manufacturing 
at companies across the country. ^ _ _ _ = On the Net: Manufacturing:

Searching for bargains after a four-day selloff, buyers returned to 
Wall Street Tuesday, giving the market a modest lift. A weaker-than 
expected report on manufacturing from the Institute Supply Management 
limited the market's gains, as did the ever-present anxiety about 
the war with Iraq. In the first hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial 
average was up 45.24, or 0.6 percent, at 8,037.37, having suffered 
a four-day loss of 288.10 and a first-quarter drop of 4.2 percent. 
The broader market was also higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 
7.69, or 0.6 percent, to 1,348.86. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index 
advanced 5.47, or 0.6 percent, to 853.65. Wall Street's advance was 
modest compared with the steep four-day declines and investors were 
tentative amid ongoing worries about war with Iraq. Wall Street is 
also on edge about first-quarter earnings that companies will report 
later this month. Tuesday's economic news also kept the market's gains 
in check. The Institute for Supply Management reported that business 
at U.S. factories decreased for the first time in five months. The 
institue blamed the war for a plunge in new orders to manufacturers. 
The group's index of business activity fell to 46.2 in March, slipping 
from February's 50.5 reading. The report was worrisome for two reasons: 
A reading below 50 means manufacturing activity is contracting, and 
it was weaker than the 49 level that economists predicted. Analysts 
said the market was able to shake off the disappointing economic news 
only because investors were interested in picking up bargain-priced 
stocks, not because of renewed confidence in the economy or the market. 
SBC Communications rose 56 cents to $20.62 after Legg Mason raised 
its recommendation on the stock to ``buy'' from ``hold.'' American 
Airlines parent AMR advanced 87 cents to $2.97 on upgrades from Goldman 
Sachs and JP Morgan. Best Buy fell 64 cents to $23.38 after the electronics 
retailer cut its first-quarter earnings outlook, although its fourth-quarter 
profits beat analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. Advancing 
issues outnumbered decliners more than 6 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange where trading was light as it has been for months due to 
war worries. Volume totaled 163.02 million shares, compared with 157.25 
million at the same point Monday. The Russell 2000 index, the barometer 
of smaller company stocks, rose 1.03, or 0.3 percent, to 365.57. ^

Finnair said Tuesday it doesn't expect to post a profit for 2003 because 
of travelers' heightened fear of flying as fighting in Iraq continues. 
The Helsinki-based airline also said it would start temporarily laying 
off workers in May, but didn't say how many. The guidance came a week 
after the airline began a 160 million euro (US$169.3 million) cost-cutting 
program to eliminate 1,200 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force of 
10,800 through 2005. Those cuts will be permanent. For 2002, the airline 
reported a profit of 36.8 million euros, up from 7.1 million euros 
in 2001. At the time, it warned that 2003 would be a difficult year. 
Last year, 7 million passengers flew Finnair, down from 7.5 million 
in 2001. Shares of Finnair were down 0.16 euros (17 cents), or 4.5 
percent, to close at 3.40 euros (US$3.71) in trading Tuesday on the 
Helsinki Stock Exchange. Founded in 1923, Finnair is one of the world's 
oldest airlines. The government owns 58 percent of Finnair which flies 
to 50 destinations worldwide with a fleet of 60 aircraft. Finnair 
is a member of the OneWorld alliance, which includes American Airlines 
and British Airways. _ _ _ On the Net: Finnair: http://www.finnair.com

Using ships, divers and even dolphins, Australian, British and American 
forces rushed to clear mines from the waters in southern Iraq and 
clear a path for humanitarian aid. The first boatload of supplies 
arrived last week at the strategic southern port of Umm Qasr, but 
a naval officer admitted Monday that navigating the surrounding waterways 
was still too dangerous to allow regular aid convoys. ``There's still 
a lot of work to do,'' said British Royal Navy Cmdr. Brian Mair, one 
of the officers heading up mine-clearing efforts. ``If you don't want 
mistakes and accidents to happen, you have to be slow and methodical.'' 
Clearing a safe path to Umm Qasr is key to securing southern Iraq 
and creating a foothold for the rest of country. It is Iraq's only 
deep-water port, and coalition forces hope to make it the center for 
distributing humanitarian relief. In prewar days, Umm Qasr was the 
main entry point for supplies bought through the U.N.-administered 
oil-for-food program. Annually an estimated 3 million tons of grain, 
1 million tons of dry foods, and 750,000 containers came through the 
port. War has disrupted that flow, and aid agencies have warned of 
a humanitarian crisis in Iraq, where a dozen years of economic sanctions 
have left some 60 percent of its 27 million people dependent on government 
rations. Before the shipments to Umm Qasr can resume, however, the 
treacherous channel leading to port must be completely swept of boat-sinking 
mines. British, American and Australian clearing teams have already 
been at it for more than a week. So far, they have largely cleared 
a 365-meter-wide path along the 65-kilometer-long (40-mile) channel 
from the Persian Gulf to Umm Qasr. The British supply ship RFA Sir 
Galahad docked there last Friday and unloaded the first military shipment 
of relief aid: 100 tons of water and 150 tons of rice, lentils, cooking 
oil, tomato paste, chick peas, sugar, powdered milk, and tea. But 
Mair said it would be ``some time'' before the port can be considered 
safe, stressing that it is probably impossible to ensure that all 
mines have been cleared. The coalition's aim is to achieve a clearance 
rate above 90 percent, he said. Mair wouldn't speculate about how 
many mines might be out there, saying only that coalition forces have 
destroyed ``quite a lot'' of them since clearing efforts started shortly 
after Iraqi forces were pushed from Umm Qasr. Mair helps oversee a 
variety of mine-clearing tactics from the USS Ponce, an amphibious 
support ship in the Persian Gulf. The first line of defense are the 
mine clearing ships _ six of them British, four American _ that blanket 
the seas with powerful sonar searching for unusual objects, what the 
mine hunters call ``contacts.'' Many mines use magnetic triggers, 
so the ships are made from nonmagnetic materials, like plastic, fiberglass 
and phosphor bronze. To cut down on the threat of mines set off by 
sounds or vibrations, the ships are designed to be extremely quiet. 
Once a contact is made, human divers or remote-controlled vehicles 
are sent down to check it out. If it appears to be a mine or unexploded 
ordnance _ which can also pose a threat to ships _ divers place an 
explosive on it and blow it up. Helicopters can also hunt for mines 
by dragging a ``sled'' through the water behind them. The sleds create 
a magnetic field and produce sounds and vibrations similar to those 
of a ship. The idea is to trigger mines planted on the seabed. And 
of course, there are the mine-hunting dolphins _ a total of nine in 
the region _ specially trained to use their natural sonar to root 
out the deadly underwater bombs. So far, the dolphins are getting 
rave reviews. ``The Lord God decided to give them the best sonar ever 
devised,'' Mair said. ``We can only aspire to their ability.''

Thousands of people gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday 
for the most eagerly awaited arguments of the session: two cases that 
could rewrite rules for affirmative action. The court was hearing 
back-to-back arguments asking how and whether race can be a factor 
when public colleges and universities choose their students. More 
broadly, the cases stemming from the University of Michigan's admissions 
policies ask wrenching legal and constitutional questions about equality, 
fairness, opportunity and U.S. history. The court's ruling, expected 
by July, could effectively end any state-sponsored affirmative action, 
or it could rewrite the rules for when race may be a factor in government 
decisions. The last time the court visited the issue was 25 years 
ago, in University of California v. Bakke. That fractured ruling struck 
down quota systems but left some room for race to be a factor in university 
admissions. Michigan and its law school give extra credit to minority 
applicants, making it more likely that a black, Hispanic or Native 
American will edge out a white applicant who has similar test scores, 
grades or other attributes. More than 100 friend of the court filings 
rolled in during the weeks preceding arguments. Lawyers could not 
remember another case that generated more. In another sign of the 
case's importance, the high court will release an audio tape immediately 
after the two-hour arguments. It is only the second time the court 
has done so. The first time was the presidential election cases in 
2000. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader, was among speakers 
outside the court Tuesday, where the crowd estimated by police at 
5,000 to 7,000 people was decidedly pro-affirmative action. ``There 
are more blacks in prison than in college. Young America, fight back,'' 
Jackson said. Many people bore signs and chanted slogans supporting 
affirmative action. ``They say Jim Crow, we say hell no,'' one group 
of demonstrators chanted. Jim Crow laws discriminate against blacks. 
The term comes from an 18th century Kentucky plantation song. Police 
barricaded the plaza and steps in front of the court, keeping protesters 
on the sidewalk. ``Affirmative action helped me, and I'm here to support 
students from all over the country,'' said Rosa Clemente of New York 
City. ``The Supreme Court needs to do the right thing and support 
affirmative action,'' added Clemente, who described herself as a ``black 
Puerto Rican'' with degrees from the State University of New York 
at Albany and Cornell University. The University of Michigan and its 
supporters contend that a diverse student body is a worthy goal that 
benefits all students. Government, in this case a public-funded university, 
has what the Supreme Court has called a compelling interest in furthering 
that goal, the school argues. Three white students who challenged 
the Michigan policies frame their argument in stark terms: It is not 
fair for a student to win a coveted place on campus just because he 
or she is a minority. ``I was treated unfairly because of my skin 
color,'' said Jennifer Gratz, a white student rejected by the university. 
``Court records show that if I had been black, Hispanic or Native 
American, I would have had a nearly 100 percent chance of admission 
with my grades and record.'' The cases directly address only admissions 
at public, tax-supported institutions, but the court's rationale is 
expected to have a wide ripple through private colleges and universities, 
other government decision-making and the business world.

Iraqi forces fired artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades 
at U.S. forces in and around Diwaniyah amid a fierce firefight with 
U.S. Marines Tuesday, according to field reports. At least 75 Iraqis 
were killed in fighting on Diwaniyah's outskirts and at least 44 soldiers, 
including some Republican Guard officers, were taken prisoner, according 
to Marine Lt. Col. B. P. McCoy. There were no report of American casualties. 
Northeast of Diwaniyah, there was heavy bombing Tuesday near Kut to 
clear the way for ground forces, a Marine intelligence analyst said. 
Marine ground forces also have secured an airbase at Qalat Sukkar, 
southeast of Kut, that is expected to serve as a staging ground. Around 
Diwaniyah, 120 kilometers (75 miles) southeast of Baghdad, U.S. Marines 
came under fire from artillery and mortars. Hundreds of Iraqi fighters 
with rocket-propelled grenades and rifles inside the town put up determined 
resistance during the 8-hour firefight, McCoy said. ``We hammered 
them pretty hard.'' ``They were shooting from buildings, from dugout 
positions, from holes from everything. They would jump out to shoot. 
They were behind buses. You name it they were there,'' said Cpl. Patrick 
Irish of the Marines' 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment. Marine 155 mm howitzers 
several kilometers (miles) away fired on Iraqi mortar positions, tanks 
and bunkers. At least three Iraqis were wounded: Two very thin Iraqi 
soldiers who had been shot in the legs were being treated with their 
hands bound behind their backs with silver duct tape; and an older 
man who had been shot in the back and leg. Overnight, warplanes struck 
at Iraqi positions around Karbala and Hindiyah, about 80 kilometers 
(50 miles) from Baghdad, in a U.S. effort to open the way for the 
invasion of Baghdad by American forces massing outside the city. The 
bombing was in support of the Army's V Corps and hit surface-to-air 
missile sites and a bridge across the Euphrates River, said Lt. j.g. 
Nicole Kratzer, a spokeswoman for the air wing of the aircraft carrier 
USS Kitty Hawk. In Baghdad, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf 
said 56 people were killed and 268 wounded overnight, including 24 
dead in Baghdad. He said nine children, including an infant, were 
killed Tuesday morning in the town of Hillah, about 80 kilometers 
(50 miles) south of the capital. ``They are racist. So they are indiscriminately 
killing people,'' al-Sahhaf said. ``Hillah is my hometown. It is a 
civilian place.'' ``Iraqis are resisting the mercenaries of the occupation 
by all means,'' he said, ``through Fedayeen action, martyrdom, ambushes 
and direct confrontation by all means possible.'' Arab-language satellite 
television Al Jazeera reported air attacks around the southern city 
of Basra and showed a white cloud and black smoke rising into the 
sky, according to live footage. The station said the Tannouma area 
of Basra was targeted as well as a government building in central 
Basra. Soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division rested Tuesday, cleaning 
their weapons, after pitched street battles with Republican Guards 
and other Iraqi loyalists in the Euphrates River town of Hindiyah 
the day before. Overhead, U.S. troops watched B-52 bombers circle 
and drop bombs near Karbala and six cruise missiles left contrails 
in the sky as they flew toward Baghdad and Karbala. ``We need to keep 
these guys from becoming complacent, thinking they can take anything 
the Iraqis throw at us,'' said Lt. Col. Philip DeCamp, commander of 
the 3rd Battalion. He warned that the defenders south of Baghdad will 
have more powerful weapons, capable of penetrating the armor on U.S. 
vehicles.

A high-profile effort by Japan to tighten surveillance of North Korea 
got off to a shaky start as Japanese officials contradicted each other 
and their allies over reports Tuesday that the communist nation had 
test-fired a missile. The confusion came just days after Japan put 
its first spy satellites into orbit as part of a billion-dollar program 
aimed at monitoring moves by North Korea to develop missiles or nuclear 
weapons. North Korea denounced the satellite launch as a hostile act 
and hinted it might test-fire a missile in response. That scenario 
appeared to play out early Tuesday, when Japanese military and government 
officials announced that North Korea had launched a shore-to-ship 
missile from its west coast into the Yellow Sea. The U.S. Defense 
Department confirmed the report, and officials in both countries described 
the missile as a short-range weapon that was not considered a threat. 
But South Korea said it had no evidence of a launch, and hours later 
officials in Tokyo weren't so sure themselves. A senior Defense Agency 
official issued a retraction Tuesday evening, telling reporters the 
government was ``still trying to confirm'' reports that a missile 
had been fired. 'We are still trying to confirm information including 
whether or not a launch took place,'' said the official, Shoei Yamanaka. 
``It is regrettable I must start by issuing this correction.'' Japanese 
officials were tightlipped about the source of their information. 
But the chief government spokesman did say the reports indicated North 
Korea had issued a keep-clear warning to maritime traffic similar 
to those that preceded previous test launches of anti-ship missiles. 
A military analyst said the information probably came from U.S. officials, 
since Japan's two new spy satellites were not expected to be fully 
operational for three months. But he added that the unexplained retraction 
reflected weaknesses in the nation's intelligence community that might 
not be rectified by its new eyes in the sky. ``This just proves that 
Japan's ability to verify data isn't reliable,'' said Tetsuya Ozeki, 
director of the private ATWI research institute. ``Someone in the 
Defense Agency may have jumped to the wrong conclusion based on a 
piece of unconfirmed information from Washington.'' In any case, Tuesday's 
embarrassing about-face was not the image Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi's government wanted to project to a nation worried about the 
threat posed by increasing sophisticated missiles under development 
by North Korea. That threat was illustrated in dramatic fashion in 
1998, when North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile that flew over 
Japan's main island before crashing into the ocean. The so-called 
``Taepodong shock'' showed that virtually all of Japan was within 
range of North Korean missiles and jolted a country used to relying 
on the United States for the bulk of its intelligence. The government's 
response was a 250 billion yen (US$2 billion) surveillance program 
that calls for putting at least four spy satellites into orbit. The 
first two were launched Friday from Japan's space center on the southern 
island of Tanegashima and are expected to be in use for about five 
years. North Korea has warned that the program might spark an arms 
race in Asia, language that has raised concerns the communist nation 
might carry out a tit-for-tat test launch of one of its missiles. 
Early Tuesday a Japanese Cabinet minister and a senior military official 
said it had done just that. Transport Minister Chigake Ogi told lawmakers 
Tuesday morning that North Korea had fired a missile into the Yellow 
Sea from a site along its western coast at about 10:15 a.m. local 
time. A similar announcement was made later by Koichi Furusho, chief 
of staff of Japan's navy. But the government appeared to waver Tuesday 
afternoon after South Korea dismissed the report. An official at the 
Defense Ministry in Seoul said South Korean and U.S. intelligence 
officials had concluded there was no missile launch. Japanese officials 
including Yamanaka and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda later 
distanced themselves from the earlier remarks by their colleagues, 
saying the launch reports had not been confirmed. It was unclear late 
Tuesday when the government would make a follow-up announcement. North 
Korea test-fired two short-range missiles in late February and early 
March as the crisis over its suspected nuclear weapons program deepened. 
That crisis started late last year, when U.S. officials said North 
Korea admitted secretly developing weapons in violation of a 1994 
agreement. Washington and its allies responded by suspending fuel 
shipments, and Pyongyang retaliated by expelling U.N. monitors, withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and restarting a nuclear 
reactor.

Israel's foreign minister confirmed Tuesday, after meetings in Washington, 
that the United States is determined to publish a Mideast peace plan 
soon, and said Israel would seek changes before accepting it. The 
Israeli opposition leader, Amram Mitzna, and Palestinian officials 
said Israel is effectively rejecting the plan, a three-stage ``road 
map'' to Palestinian statehood by 2005. The Americans are ``determined 
to publish the road map,'' the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, told 
Israel Army Radio on Tuesday, a day after meeting with U.S. President 
George W. Bush at the White House. Shalom laid down a number of conditions 
for the resumption talks with the Palestinians and said that ``the 
road map needs to be adapted.'' Israel has repeatedly said it accepts 
the ``Bush vision'' based on a broad-based policy speech delivered 
by the U.S. president on June 24, 2002, but has balked at embracing 
the road map _ drawn up by the ``Quartet'' of United States, the European 
Union, Russia and The United Nations _ outlining implementation of 
the Bush vision. A diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said that officials of the Quartet would meet in Brussels on Thursday 
to discuss the possible publication of the road map and how to monitor 
compliance by both sides. The source said the monitoring mechanism 
was expected to be a point of contention. ``We expect that after the 
road map is published the first things they (the Palestinians) must 
do is halt the terror and the incitement,'' Shalom said. If the conditions 
are met, Israel would be a ``true partner, exploring all roads to 
peace,'' Shalom said. The road map envisions a Palestinian state in 
provisional borders by the end of the year. After a cease-fire is 
in place, Palestinians would have to work hard to rein in militants, 
while Israel would have to withdraw from Palestinian cities and freeze 
settlement construction. The United States and Britain have said the 
road map would be unveiled after the new Palestinian prime minister, 
Mahmoud Abbas, and his new Cabinet are sworn in, probably sometime 
this month. Palestinian Cabinet Minister Saeb Erekat said Israel's 
demands for changes amount to a rejection of the plan. ``We had hoped 
that Mr. Shalom would have announced Israel's full commitment and 
acceptance of the road map. In reality he actually announced Israel's 
rejection,'' Erekat said. Israeli Labor Party Chairman Amram Mitzna 
said he suspected the Israeli government was playing for time. ``This 
is a recipe to say yes while in reality saying no,'' Mitzna told Army 
Radio. Also Tuesday, Israeli troops demolished the homes of five suspected 
Palestinian militants, including that of a suicide bomber who blew 
himself up in the coastal city of Netanya over the weekend. In the 
West Bank village of Deir Ghassoon near Tulkarem, forces destroyed 
the home of Rami Ghanem, 20 _ the Islamic Jihad bomber who blew up 
on Sunday at Cafe London in Netanya, wounding 49 people, the army 
said. Islamic Jihad said the bombing, the first since the U.S.-led 
war in Iraq began, was a ``gift'' to the Iraqi people and vowed to 
step up its attacks against Israel during the war. The group also 
said it had sent suicide bombers to Iraq to help fight American and 
British soldiers. In the Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah, troops 
demolished four homes belonging to four suspected militants from one 
family, the Najis, the army said. The four were members of the Al 
Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militia affiliated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah 
faction. The Naji family is accused of carrying out and plotting a 
series of attacks on Israelis, the army said. The Najis participated 
in a shooting attack in a Tel Aviv restaurant in March 2002 in which 
three people were killed and another in Jerusalem in February 2002 
in which a police officer was killed, the army said. ^ gr/kl/dp &lt;

The Saudi foreign minister said Tuesday that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein should make the sacrifice of stepping down if it would end 
the war. The remark provoked a sharp rebuke from Iraq. ``If the only 
thing remaining to resolve the situation in Iraq is a sacrifice from 
President Saddam Hussein and since he's asking all Iraqis to sacrifice 
their lives for their country, then the least that can be expected 
is that he would do the same and sacrifice for his country,'' Prince 
Saud said. At a news conference in Baghdad, Iraqi Vice President Taha 
Yassin Ramadan responded with a rebuke directed at the Saudi foreign 
minister: ``Go to hell.'' ``You are too much of a nothing to say a 
word addressed to a leader of Iraq,'' Ramadan added. Saud said he 
was not calling on or urging Saddam to step down. But asked whether 
it was too late for such a move from the Iraqi leader, who has pledged 
never to resign, said: ``Why should it be too late?'' Saud's remarks 
appeared to be a signal to Saddam that the exile option is still open. 
In a joint interview before the war started with the Saudi-owned Asharq 
al-Awsat daily newspaper and Lebanon's al-Mustaqbal satellite television, 
Saud was quoted as saying that the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved 
had Saddam accepted a proposal by the United Arab Emirates urging 
him to step down and go into exile. The prince's remarks then were 
the closest Saudi Arabia had come to endorsing the idea. Saud said 
a U.S. ``military occupation'' of Iraq would not resolve the Iraq 
conflict and called for a cease-fire to allow diplomacy to work. ``Conflict 
is not really the best way to resolve disputes,'' said Saud. ``Let 
us stop it now before hatred grips our hearts and our souls.'' He 
said one of the reasons the kingdom is against the war ``is because 
wars tend to spread and especially wars in areas that have chronic 
problems like the Middle East.'' ``We are afraid of the spread of 
war,'' said Saud. Saud also lashed out at unnamed U.S. ``prognosticators 
and advisers who have covered the wave lengths of all media stations'' 
for giving the impression that Washington intends to change the geopolitical 
map in the region, feeding Arab fears that Iraq is the first U.S. 
step toward controlling the area. Saud, a graduate of Princeton University, 
said it is ``not within the character of the United States, at least 
not the United States that I know,'' to do that, adding that U.S. 
President George W. Bush and his government are ``talking a different 
language.'' ``This is creating great confusion that exists in the 
Arab world about the motives of the United States,'' added Saud. ``I 
think and this country thinks, as a friend of the United States, that 
this image must change and the true nature of the American people 
should emerge from this fog that was created by these few individuals.'' 
Saud said his country will work hard to maintain the relations the 
kingdom has had with the United States for more than six decades, 
saying ``it's not something easy to dispense with this friendship.'' 
Saud said ``there was no permission asked and no permission given 
for overflying'' Tomahawk cruise missiles through Saudi airspace. 
Four of the missiles that have missed their targets on their flight 
paths to Iraq have landed in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. military has agreed 
to temporarily suspend Tomahawk launches from the eastern Mediterranean 
Sea and the Red Sea. Saudi Arabia, fearful of an internal, Muslim 
extremist backlash, has been quiet about its support for the U.S. 
military strikes on Iraq. In the 1991 Gulf War, the use of Saudi territory 
by U.S. troops as a launch pad against Iraq produced a cause for al-Qaida 
leader Osama bin Laden to rally militants. ^ da/db &lt;

A former senior government official being tried on charges that he 
plotted to kill a prominent Czech journalist will remain behind bars 
indefinitely, the suspect's lawyer said Tuesday. The judge hearing 
the case against Karel Srba, a former Foreign Ministry general secretary 
arrested last July, has refused to grant Srba provisional release 
on 3 million koruna (US$100,000) bail or on assurances that he poses 
no flight risk, defense attorney Miroslav Krizenecky said. ``He certainly 
is accused of a serious criminal activity, but it's still difficult 
for me to understand,'' said Krizenecky, a former prosecutor who was 
the Czech Communist Party's candidate for president in January elections. 
Srba and three other suspects are charged with plotting the slaying 
of Sabina Slonkova, an investigative reporter with the influential 
newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. He faces up to 15 years in prison if 
convicted. Slonkova had written a series of articles describing a 
deal in which the Foreign Ministry leased a building in Moscow, owned 
by the Czech government, to a private company under suspicious circumstances. 
The newspaper also published a list of properties owned by Srba which 
significantly surpassed his official income, prompting financial authorities 
to launch an investigation. Srba ran the finances at the ministry 
under former Finance Minister Jan Kavan, signing countless investment 
contracts before he was fired in 2001 amid allegations of corruption. 
In August, he was formally charged with corruption. Srba pleaded innocent 
at his trial, which opened last month at a regional court in Ceske 
Budejovice, 150 kilometers (90 miles) south of Prague before adjourning 
until April 16. Prosecutors say a police raid on Srba's home uncovered 
photographs of the targeted journalist, documents containing details 
of her life and about 30 million koruna (US$1 million) in cash. (kj/nr/bk)

Poland's Cabinet decided Tuesday to send troops trained for chemical 
warfare protection to Turkey as part of NATO's defenses against a 
possible Iraqi attack on its neighbor. The 60 soldiers' mission, which 
requires approval by President Aleksander Kwasniewski, is due to begin 
Friday and run through Sept. 30, government spokesman Michal Tober 
said. ``As a credible NATO member, we have a moral and political duty 
to extend such support,'' Tober said after the decision by Prime Minister 
Leszek Miller's Cabinet. NATO already has deployed anti-missile batteries 
and AWACS surveillance planes to defend Turkey in the event of attacks 
from neighboring Iraq. Poland, which joined NATO in 1999 together 
with Hungary and the Czech Republic, supports the U.S.-led war in 
Iraq and has contributed up to 200 troops _ including 56 members of 
the elite GROM commando unit. Poland's stand has put it at odds with 
leading European powers opposed to the war, notably France and Germany.

Police said the Bible's admonition against murder apparently convinced 
a man with a history of mental problems to confess to fatally shooting 
four immigrants, three of them out of anti-Arab anger. Larme Price 
told a detective that he shot three victims _ one Guyanese, one Indian 
and one Yemeni _ because he believed each was of Middle Eastern descent, 
a criminal complaint said. He said he shot a Russian-born man because 
he ``felt bad vibes'' about him, the complaint added. Price, 30, was 
ordered held without bail following his arraignment Monday on charges 
of first-degree murder, second-degree attempted murder and criminal 
possession of a weapon. He was placed on suicide watch at the request 
of his attorney, John Youngblood. The defendant's relatives refused 
to comment as they left the courthouse. Police said the gunman wanted 
to exact revenge for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The killings 
began on Feb. 8 with the shooting of John Freddy, 40, a Guyana native 
drinking coffee at a convenience store. A surveillance camera showed 
a man in a dark coat, baseball cap and hooded sweat shirt shooting 
Freddy behind the ear. About two hours later, Indian immigrant Sukhjit 
Khajala, 50, was fatally shot in the face with the same .40-caliber 
revolver used in Freddy's killing, authorities said. Russian-born 
laundry manager Albert Kotlyar, 32, was killed March 10. Ten days 
later, Mohammed Ali Nassir, 54, was shot and killed while sitting 
near the door of a food store. Another employee was wounded. Police 
said Price, who has two children and a pregnant girlfriend, apparently 
began having second thoughts about the shootings after reading the 
Sixth Commandment in the Bible: ``Thou shall not kill.'' ``He was 
reading the Bible and he wanted to help the police end this,'' said 
Deputy Inspector Vito Spano, who headed the police task force. ``He 
was not happy with what he was doing.'' Price walked into a police 
precinct Friday and offered to help track down the suspect, police 
said. Within a day, police said, they obtained Price's confession. 
Price's mother, Leatha Price, said her son struggled with drug abuse 
and had mental problems that were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. 
She said she tried unsuccessfully to have him admitted to a hospital.

The U.N. health agency said Tuesday it is considering whether to advise 
travelers against going to Hong Kong and other Asian countries hit 
by a mysterious and deadly disease. The rare move follows information 
from Hong Kong authorities that they have been unable to find a link 
between new cases there and patients previously infected with Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which has so far killed at least 
63 people and sickened more than 1,600. ``It appears that there is 
now some environmental factor, such as water or sewage, which is taking 
this disease from one human to another,'' said Dr. David Heymann, 
infectious diseases chief at the World Health Organization. He said 
the concerns center around an apartment block in Hong Kong where a 
large number of cases have been reported. Some patients do not remember 
being in contact with any other patient, leading doctors to wonder 
if the disease is being spread through the building without close 
human contact. WHO still insists that the disease is not airborne 
but says it can be passed through small droplets of breath or by touching 
something recently touched by a patient. Heymann said the WHO is hopeful 
that authorities will link all the cases by early Wednesday. If not, 
it will decide whether to advise against travel. Until now, WHO has 
issued advice only to governments, with the aim of preventing the 
spread of the disease. It hasn't advised against travel, but has said 
airports should screen passengers and refuse to board those who have 
symptoms or who have been in contact with SARS patients. Now it is 
considering updating its advice to travelers to take account of SARS. 
Until now, that list mostly consists of advice on whether travelers 
need vaccinations or antimalarial tablets. But there is no vaccination 
available against SARS ``so the advice might be to avoid the area 
altogether,'' Heymann said. With cases already found in a number of 
European countries from air passengers who have been in the affected 
regions, Denmark, Belgium and the Czech Republic are among European 
countries already have advised residents against traveling there unless 
their trip is absolutely essential. ^ (nk-agh) &lt;

Turkmenistan President Saparmurat Niyazov scolded top officials about 
the state of the country's decrepit armed forces, telling them to 
better train soldiers. ``You can't cram soldiers' heads full of studies 
and lectures. Soldiers should practice,'' Niyazov told Defense Minister 
Redzhepbai Arzov and border service chief Agadzhan Mametgeldyev during 
a Monday Cabinet meeting. ``Right now we have 600 tanks, 100 of them 
in non-working condition. Give the soldiers a screwdriver and let 
them figure out how to fix the motor,'' he said. He said soldiers 
should also be put to work on construction projects and farms, to 
teach them useful skills. Turkmenistan's military has fallen into 
disarray since the collapse of the Soviet Union and is one of the 
weakest in Central Asia. Niyazov, who has ruled the country since 
1985 when it was still a Soviet republic, maintains a tight grip on 
power and has fostered a vast cult of personality around himself. 
The country's remains mired in poverty despite its vast energy riches.

Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an 
ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect in the assassination 
of Serbia's prime minister. Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary 
commander and the leader of an underworld Belgrade clan, also is linked 
to other politically motivated killings during Milosevic's autocratic 
rule, investigators said in a statement. Lukovic and his gang ``killed 
political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, 
Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement 
said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic passport and 
a fake Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name. The discovery ``will 
speed up the arrest of that criminal,'' they said. Lukovic has been 
on the run since the March 12 sniper assassination of Prime Minister 
Zoran Djindjic in downtown Belgrade. Also Tuesday, two close Milosevic 
aides _ his former army chief, Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, and former 
customs chief, Mihalj Kertes _ were detained for questioning, said 
police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Kertes was considered 
a key figure in the secret financing of Serb rebels and paramilitaries 
fighting in Bosnia and Croatia, while Pavkovic commanded Milosevic's 
army units in Kosovo during the 1998-99 conflict there. A special 
police unit under Lukovic's command until 2001 is suspected of having 
carried out Djindjic's killing after slaying former Serbian President 
Ivan Stambolic in August 2000. The police statement came a day after 
authorities sought an international arrest warrant for Markovic, alleging 
she was involved in Stambolic's killing. She denounced the warrant 
in a message from Russia as a political ploy. The investigation of 
Djindjic's killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy led by war criminals 
and war profiteers ... all from the ranks of Milosevic's regime,'' 
police said in Tuesday's statement. As president, Milosevic allowed 
underworld figures to fight alongside notorious paramilitary units 
in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, he gave them a free hand 
to join regular police forces, such as the special police unit linked 
to crime and drug trafficking rings, authorities allege. Those ties 
continued even after the pro-democracy leadership took over in 2000. 
Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to the U.N. war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Later, Djindjic spearheaded efforts 
to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. The 
warrant sought for Markovic was part authorities' efforts to find 
those who ordered the killing of Stambolic. Markovic wielded considerable 
influence over Milosevic and his leftist Socialist Party. Stambolic, 
Serbia's president for a year in the late 1980s, was preparing to 
challenge Milosevic in national elections when he disappeared in August, 
2000, just two months before Milosevic was ousted. Serbian police 
last week discovered Stambolic's body during a crackdown on the paramilitary 
and underworld network accused of Djindjic's assassination. Markovic 
reportedly left for Russia in late February to join her son, Marko 
Milosevic, who fled Serbia following Milosevic's ouster. (pvs/kk/bk)

George Connor, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the first 
of the Chicago Bears' great linebackers, has died. He was 78. The 
first winner of the Outland Trophy, given to the nation's top college 
lineman, in 1946, Connor died Monday after a long illness. A star 
at offensive and defensive tackle, Connor became the first of the 
big, mobile linebackers when the Bears asked the 6-foot-3 (1.9-meter), 
240-pounder (108-kilogram) to stop Philadelphia's great running back, 
Steve Van Buren. Connor not only stayed at linebacker, he defined 
the position for future generations of Bears greats like Dick Butkus 
and Mike Singletary. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame in 1975. ``George typified what the Bears were back then _ tough 
and hard-nosed,'' former teammate Ed Sprinkle said. Connor was an 
All-American at Holy Cross before World War II interrupted his college 
career. When he returned, he made All-American twice on two undefeated 
Notre Dame teams. Connor is remembered for one devastating tackle 
of Green Bay's Veryl Switzer on a kick return in Wrigley Field in 
1955. Switzer's helmet flew one way, the ball another, and Bears linebacker 
Bill George recovered the fumble for a touchdown. ``After five minutes, 
there was a roar from the crowd,'' Connor once recalled. ``I asked 
Johnny Lujack what happened and he said, 'Switzer just got up.''' 
After a knee injury forced Connor to retire, he served as an assistant 
coach and later a broadcaster. He was a popular master of ceremonies 
for numerous charity events and a successful Chicago businessman. 
Survivors include his wife Suzanne; sons George Jr. and Albert; a 
sister, Mary Ellen Woodward; a brother, Jack; and several nieces and 
nephews.

Chanting anti-American slogans, hundreds filled the streets of this 
impoverished west African nation's capital on Tuesday to protest the 
U.S.-led war against Iraq. In Burkina Faso's first demonstration against 
the war, up to 1,000 people shouting ``Bush: Assassin'' marched to 
the United Nations' mission building to demand that U.S.-led forces 
leave Iraq. ``What is taking place in Iraq can happen to us and is 
even affecting us already,'' said march organizer Moise Sawadago _ 
who like many marchers blames the Iraq invasion for the country's 
recent 10 percent fuel-price hike. Many Muslims in the crowd cried 
``Allah Akhbar,'' or ``God is Great.'' About 40 percent of Burkina 
Faso's 12 million people are Muslim. Heavily armed riot police looked 
on, but the march ended peacefully. No arrests or injuries were reported. 
Burkina Faso has seen five military coups since independence from 
France in 1960, including the bloody 1987 takeover that gave President 
Blaise Compaore control of the landlocked, resource-poor country. 
Compaore has since kept power through elections. (bo-nd-esh)

Police said Tuesday they were closing in on an underworld boss _ an 
ally of Slobodan Milosevic _ who is the prime suspect in the assassination 
of Serbia's prime minister. Milorad Lukovic, a former paramilitary 
commander and the leader of an underworld Belgrade clan, also is linked 
to other politically motivated killings during Milosevic's autocratic 
rule, investigators said in a statement. Lukovic and his gang ``killed 
political opponents'' of the former Yugoslav president and his wife, 
Mirjana Markovic, and ``tortured and harassed their foes,'' the statement 
said. Police said they discovered a Yugoslav diplomatic passport and 
a fake Croatian passport issued in Lukovic's name. The discovery ``will 
speed up the arrest of that criminal,'' they said. Lukovic has been 
on the run since the March 12 sniper assassination of Prime Minister 
Zoran Djindjic in downtown Belgrade. Also Tuesday, two close Milosevic 
aides _ his former army chief, Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, and former 
customs chief Mihalj Kertes _ were detained for questioning, according 
to police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Kertes was 
considered a key figure in the secret financing of Serb rebels and 
paramilitaries fighting in Bosnia and Croatia, while Pavkovic commanded 
Milosevic's army units in Kosovo during the 1998-99 conflict there. 
A special police unit under Lukovic's command until 2001 is suspected 
of having carried out Djindjic's killing and of slaying former Serbian 
President Ivan Stambolic in August 2000. Tuesday's police statement 
came a day after authorities sought an international arrest warrant 
for Markovic, alleging she was involved in Stambolic's killing. She 
denounced the warrant in a message from Russia as a political ploy. 
The investigation of Djindjic's killing ``clearly points to a conspiracy 
led by war criminals and war profiteers ... all from the ranks of 
Milosevic's regime,'' the police statement said. As president, Milosevic 
allowed underworld figures to fight alongside notorious paramilitary 
units in the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Afterward, he gave them a free 
hand to join regular police forces, authorities allege. Those ties 
continued even after the pro-democracy leadership took over in 2000. 
Djindjic engineered Milosevic's extradition to the U.N. war crimes 
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Later, Djindjic spearheaded efforts 
to crack down on the underworld, which made him many enemies. Markovic 
wielded considerable influence over Milosevic and his leftist Socialist 
Party. Stambolic, Serbia's president for a year in the late 1980s, 
was preparing to challenge Milosevic in national elections when he 
disappeared in August, 2000, just two months before Milosevic was 
ousted. Serbian police last week discovered Stambolic's body during 
a crackdown on the paramilitary and underworld network accused of 
Djindjic's assassination. Markovic reportedly left for Russia in late 
February to join her son, Marko Milosevic, who fled Serbia following 
Milosevic's ouster.

Albania's human rights record remained poor last year despite improvements 
in some areas, according to a U.S. State Department report released 
Tuesday in the Albanian capital. ``The overall performance of law 
enforcement remained weak,'' the U.S. government's 2002 annual human 
rights on Albania said, citing high levels of violent crime and widespread 
distrust for law enforcers. Many killings resulted from gang warfare 
or traditional ``blood feud'' vendettas, the report said. It also 
noted that police officers in some cases had committed human rights 
abuses. In general, though, police remained poorly trained even though 
the country receives international aid earmarked for police reform. 
``Because of political pressure, intimidation, endemic corruption, 
bribery, and limited resources, the judiciary was unable to function 
independently and efficiently,'' the report said. Prison conditions 
also remained poor, and while new prisons have been opened in recent 
years, overcrowding remained a serious problem, the report said. Albanian 
police officers were also found to be involved in human trafficking, 
the report noted, calling this ``a serious problem.'' The government, 
which hopes to eventually join NATO and the European Union, has said 
it is trying to fight organized crime, trafficking and corruption. 
There was no immediate reaction on the report from the government.

A Norwegian court will hear the appeal of a teenager's acquittal on 
charges that he created and circulated online a program that cracks 
the security codes on DVDs, prosecutors said Tuesday. Erik Moestue 
of Norway's economic crimes unit told The Associated Press the trial 
was scheduled for early December in the capital, Oslo. Jon Lech Johansen, 
19, was acquitted of violating Norway's data break-in laws Jan. 7. 
The Oslo District Court said Johansen could not be convicted of breaking 
into DVD films he legally owned, or of providing a tool others might 
use to copy films illegally. The case was the first of its kind in 
the nation and a key test in determining how far existing laws protect 
copyright holders. Johansen was 15 when he developed the program, 
DeCSS, to watch movies on a Linux-based computer without DVD-viewing 
software. He also posted it on the Internet. The program is just one 
of many that can break the film industry's Content Scrambling System, 
which prevents illegal copying and blocks the use of legitimate copies 
on unauthorized equipment. Prosecutors filed charges against Johansen 
last year after a complaint from the Motion Picture Association of 
America and the DVD Copy Control Association, the group that licenses 
CSS. (ws-mpm)

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday dismissed a report that Ukrainian 
arms dealers sold anti-tank missiles to Iraq as an attempt to discredit 
the country's leadership. The U.S.-based magazine Newsweek cited unnamed 
Pentagon officials in its report this week that Ukrainian arms dealers 
sent about 500 Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles to Baghdad in 
January. The report said Iraqi forces used the missiles to destroy 
two U.S. Abrams tanks. ``This is nothing more than another attempt 
to undermine the authority of our state,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Markian Lybkivskyi said. ``Ukraine did nothing to violate U.N. sanctions 
... and sold no weapons to Iraq.'' The issue of illegal supplies to 
Iraq surfaced a week ago after reports that three Russian companies 
violated U.N. sanctions by selling military equipment to Baghdad. 
The Kremlin vigorously denied the U.S. claims. Analysts suggested 
that third countries could have transferred Russian-made equipment 
or arms to Iraq. The report of alleged missile sales was the third 
time Ukraine has been accused of violating sanctions on Iraq. Last 
year, Washington said it had verified the authenticity of a July 2000 
audio recording in which President Leonid Kuchma is allegedly heard 
approving the sale of four Kolchuha radar systems to Iraq. In January, 
Ukraine denied selling pontoon bridges to Iraq. Kuchma insisted last 
week that the U.S.-led war in Iraq would prove his country's innocence. 
Oksana Antonenko, a security expert at the London-based International 
Institute for Strategic Studies, said well-developed, ``multinational 
criminal networks'' in Russia and Ukraine are involved in ``open smuggling'' 
worth billions of dollars. Arms dealers ``actively target'' retired 
or downsized members of the post-Soviet military to get access to 
state-of-the-art equipment, she said. ``For them, the opportunity 
to earn high salaries is not just tempting ... but a matter of survival,'' 
Antoneko said. Despite its disagreement with Washington, Ukraine began 
deploying a 532-man anti-chemical weapons battalion to Kuwait last 
month to help neutralize any Iraqi attack. Ukraine's Defense Ministry 
announced Tuesday it is trimming the number of troops to 450 based 
on ``reduced technical needs.'' (tv/sk/jh)

The Soviet-made AN-24 biplane took off from Jose Marti International 
Airport about 10:45 a.m. (15:45 GMT) for an unknown destination, apparently 
with the hijacker still aboard. Earlier in the morning, two separate 
groups of as many as two dozen passengers, including a woman with 
a small child in her arms, jumped from the open back hatch of the 
plane into the arms of emergency workers below and were taken off 
the runway in buses. Shortly before the plane took off, two white 
cars drove onto the tarmac and a man aboard one handed three large 
plastic bags filled with unknown contents to someone inside the plane.

The Toronto Stock Exchange halted trading Tuesday in Air Canada shares 
ahead of an announcement by the nation's dominant airline expected 
to involve seeking protection from creditors. An Air Canada spokesman 
confirmed the halt in share trading and said an announcement was upcoming, 
but refused to divulge further details. The airline's stock hit a 
new 52-week low on Monday, closing at C$2.11 (US$1.45) a share, down 
15 percent on the day. Air Canada ended 2002 with a C$428-million 
(US$295 million) loss, bringing the total to more than C$1.7 billion 
(US$1.1 billion) since its last profitable year in 1999. The company 
also has C$12.9 billion (US$8.8 billion) in long-term debt and leases, 
which would likely be renegotiated if Air Canada goes through a court-monitored 
financial restructuring. Media reports speculate Air Canada will seek 
bankruptcy protection to restructure its business and get assistance 
from the Canadian government, perhaps in loan guarantees. The airline 
has been hurt by the global slump in air travel after the Sept. 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks, as well as reduced traffic amid the current 
war in Iraq and the outbreak in Toronto of a mystery flu-like illness 
from Asia. On Monday, two of Air Canada's biggest unions accepted 
major layoffs as part of restructuring the airline said it needs to 
survive. The Canadian Auto Workers and the union representing machinists 
and baggage handlers said they will lose more than 2,300 jobs as their 
share of 3,600 job cuts announced March 20. The autoworkers union, 
which represents ticket agents and other workers, said it will lift 
a no-layoff clause for 1,060 employees and has agreed to defer a 2.5 
percent salary increase that was supposed to come into effect Tuesday. 
The union are expected to save Air Canada up to C$40 million (US$27.5 
million) a year. Buzz Hargrove, president of the autoworkers union, 
said it recognizes a crisis exists and that everyone _ including the 
government _ must help keep the airline flying. ``It is not a permanent 
fix,'' Hargrove said after meeting with Transport Minister David Collenette. 
``It is an interim measure that will allow reductions in the work 
force to take place immediately. We see absolutely no alternative.'' 
Collenette said Monday the federal government is considering ways 
to help the airline, but has ruled out a cash bailout. The Toronto 
Star reported Monday the government was preparing a financial package 
for Air Canada, conditional on the airline seeking protection under 
the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Under the act, Air Canada 
would get court-protection from its creditors _ allowing it to continue 
operating while working out a plan acceptable to its various stakeholders, 
including lenders, suppliers and employees. The airline also said 
Monday it will reduce its flights between Hong Kong and Canada to 
nine per week, down from 14 per week now, because of the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome outbreak in Asia and Canada. Smaller reductions 
also will be made in flights to Beijing and Shanghai, said Air Canada 
spokeswoman Laura Cooke. Air Canada is by far the country's largest 
airline and the only scheduled Canadian carrier with an extensive 
route network to the United States and other foreign destinations.

As the trickle of governing Popular Party anti-war resignations continued 
Tuesday, Spanish opposition parties presented another motion in Parliament 
condemning the attacks while tens of thousands of students staged 
more protests across the country. The resignation of councilor Edith 
Bedin Oviedo from the small central town of Damiel was the 14th so 
far in the party in protest over the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and 
the Spanish ruling party's support for it. So far no parliamentary 
deputy has resigned, although more than one has begun to voice opposition 
to the war which started March 20. Until recently, support for Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar within his party had seemed airtight. Aznar 
is one of the firmest advocates of the U.S.-led drive to oust Saddam 
Hussein although the vast majority of Spaniards are opposed to the 
war. ``What's strange is not that there should be discrepancies within 
the PP over its involvement in the war but rather that they should 
take so long in coming out,'' the leading daily El Pais said in an 
editorial. But Popular Party parliamentary spokesman Luis de Grandes 
said the dissension showed that the party was pluralist. Other party 
leaders put the resignations down to the fact that the outgoing deputies 
were not included in upcoming municipal election lists. Also Tuesday, 
tens of thousands of university students took to streets again in 
at least 10 cities to protest the war and demand Aznar's resignation. 
In Parliament, the leading opposition Socialist party was to put to 
vote a motion calling on Aznar to change tack and launch a call to 
stop the war. ``One step backward (for Aznar) would be one step forward 
for peace,'' party Parliamentary spokesman Jesus Caldera told reporters. 
The motion is expected to be backed by the opposition parties and 
rejected by the majority-ruling 183 Popular Party members. (cg/dw-jg)

A powerful explosion Tuesday in a chemical plant owned by the Dutch 
company DSM killed three people and wounded two, company officials 
said. The plant in the town of Geleen, around 200 kilometers (125 
miles) south of Amsterdam, produces melamine, a chemical component 
of plastics. The explosion occurred at 12:15 p.m. (1015 GMT) during 
repairs with a welder to a gas-powered boiler, DSM said. Two employees 
were treated on site for minor injuries and sent home, according to 
company spokesman Gerard van der Zanden. Police and ambulances were 
summoned quickly to the scene, but town officials were only informed 
two hours later, said Geleen spokeswoman Bertie Bischops. ``There 
was an explosion and there are victims ... there is no threat to the 
surrounding area,'' she said. No further details were available. Although 
the Netherlands has a substantial number of industrial manufacturers 
and chemical companies, fatal accidents are rare. The worst industrial 
accident in recent years was in May 2000, when 22 people were killed 
by an explosion at a fireworks storage depot in the eastern town of 
Enschede. DSM, a blue chip company on the Amsterdam stock exchange, 
makes coatings, resins and chemicals used in plastics. It employs 
20,000 people 40 countries, mainly in Europe and North America. Melamine 
is a fire-resistant, powdery substance used to make kitchen countertops, 
protective coatings on currency, car paint and dinner plates. (ad/am)

A day after Syria came out firmly behind Iraq, a German newspaper 
printed an interview Tuesday quoting Syrian President Bashar Assad 
as saying differences with the United States were nothing new and 
that perhaps the two countries one day would again find common ground. 
While maintaining Syria's opposition to the Iraq war, Assad did not 
echo comments by the Syrian Foreign Ministry Monday calling the U.S. 
invasion illegitimate and unjustified _ and he pointed out his country's 
backing of the U.S.-led war against terrorism launched after the Sept. 
11, 2001 terror attacks. ``The relationship between Syria and the 
United States has long been full of contradictions, the latest is 
just the most recent facet. We agree with the United States on the 
topic of terrorism, but we disagree completely on the Iraq war,'' 
Assad was quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung as saying. ``Perhaps 
one day there will be again a topic that we agree on, and then the 
relationship will look good again.'' Tensions between the United States 
and Syria have escalated this week, with Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld accusing Syria of supplying Iraq with military equipment. 
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Syria to cease 
its support for terrorism, suggesting it would otherwise face grave 
consequences. ``Syria now faces a critical choice'' of whether to 
``continue its direct support for terrorism in the dying days'' of 
President Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq, Powell said in a strongly 
worded speech Sunday to a pro-Israeli lobby. Assad blamed an aggressive 
U.S. posture for current rifts, suggesting Washington was squandering 
its stature as a superpower. ``Perhaps the United States, as a great 
power, is used to foisting its opinions on others. But every country 
has its own opinions and interests.'' He said the United States has 
failed to present evidence proving Iraq possesses weapons of mass 
destruction or tying Iraq to terrorism. The one bright spot in the 
current crisis, he said, was anti-war demonstrations in Europe and 
the Middle East, which made it more difficult for extremists to see 
the current conflict as a clash of civilizations. ``That is the only 
positive point. It is an historic opportunity that we must grab. You 
have no idea the impact of the demonstrations in Europe and the Middle 
East,'' Assad said. The Syrian president refused to comment on whether 
he believed the United States might target other countries, including 
Syria, after Iraq, saying the suggestion has been made by people he 
described as ``extreme.'' ``But the problem is that the reality is 
not very comforting _ that the only world power has lost contact with 
the world. The greatest military superpower is not helping he world, 
rather it is beginning a war. If a small country makes a mistake, 
the neighbors suffer. But when a world power makes a mistake the whole 
world suffers.'' (cb-gm)

A warplane veered off the USS Constellation's flight deck and into 
the Persian Gulf after landing early Tuesday. The two pilots ejected 
into the water and were rescued by helicopter, U.S. military officials 
said. The S-3B Viking airplane, generally used for anti-submarine 
warfare, malfunctioned while taxiing on the aircraft carrier's flight 
deck and slid off the left side into the water, said U.S. Navy Rear 
Admiral Barry Costello, commander of the Constellation's battle group 
deployed in the Gulf. Both pilots were rescued and then transported 
to the Constellation. One collapsed and was taken on a stretcher. 
The plane sank in 60 meters (200 feet) of water and was considered 
lost, said Capt. Mark Fox, commander of the Constellation's air wing. 
No cause was immediately given for the accident. In addition to anti-submarine 
warfare, S-3B Vikings are used for surveillance and precision targeting 
and for refueling other planes. _ _ _ On The Net: USS Constellation:

Cuban authorities originally had reported there were six children 
among the 46 people on the craft. It was not immediately clear what 
had happened aboard the plane that led to the release of the passengers 
after the hijacking drama that began almost 12 hours before when a 
man claiming to be armed with grenades demanded to be flown to Florida. 
The Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on a flight from 
Cuba's small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced to land in the 
capital because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it to the United 
States, Cuban authorities said. The plane spent the night on a tarmac 
at the Havana airport and shortly after daybreak, a tank with a hose 
was rolled out onto the tarmac and appeared to be refueling the craft. 
The plane for a time was surrounded by several dozen uniformed police 
officers, and two fire trucks and numerous ambulances were parked 
nearby. It would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to 
get access to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are 
heavily guarded by the military. It was also unclear how anyone would 
be able to get a pair of grenades through the heavy security checks 
at Cuba's airports, especially less than two weeks after a successful 
hijacking on the same route of a passenger plane to the United States. 
All incoming and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose Marti International 
Airport was suspended during the negotiations. A government statement 
released early Tuesday said the Soviet-made Cuban Airlines plane was 
on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of 
Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked 
to the United States by a man armed with grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, 
for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution 
that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' 
said the statement. The statement blamed the hijacking attempt on 
what Havana says is the lax treatment that six other suspected hijackers 
received last month after successfully forcing another passenger plane 
from Cuba to Key West, Florida, at knifepoint. The suspects in the 
earlier successful hijack were charged with conspiracy to seize an 
aircraft by force and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years 
in federal prison. They were granted bond, but remain behind bars 
because they have been unable to come up with the money. Cuban authorities 
were pleased that American officials decided to charge the six but 
were enraged last week when a federal judge decided to set bond over 
the objections of prosecutors. ``The entire responsibility of what 
could happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government 
of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. 
In the successful hijacking, six crew members and 25 passengers were 
on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route on March 19 when knife-wielding 
hijackers took control of the plane as it descended toward Havana 
after a trip from the Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key 
West. The earlier hijack occurred as the U.S.-led war on Iraq was 
being launched. American fighter jets scrambled from Homestead Air 
Force Reserve Base and a U.S. Customs Black Hawk helicopter joined 
them to escort the blue and white plane to Key West. Sixteen of those 
aboard later opted to return to Cuba and the only non-Cuban on the 
flight, an Italian, was released in the United States. The rest of 
the passengers and crew members on that earlier flight opted to stay 
in the United States under a U.S. immigration policy that allows Cubans 
who reach American soil to stay and seek legal residency after a year.

Doctors examining Maurice Papon to verify he is too ill to return 
to prison for complicity in crimes against humanity will announce 
their findings April 14, judicial official said Tuesday. The medical 
experts examined the 92-year-old earlier this month and had been expected 
to release their decision on Tuesday. The sources did specify a reason 
for the delay. Papon was convicted in 1998 of complicity in crimes 
against humanity for playing a role in deporting Jews from southwest 
France during World War II. He began serving a 10-year sentence in 
1999. He was released in September under a French law allowing early 
release for the ill and aging. Papon, who had heart bypass surgery 
and wears a pacemaker, had served only three years of his sentence. 
As part of his release, Papon must be periodically examined by experts 
to verify that he still qualifies for the plan. Papon was convicted 
for helping deport 1,690 Jews in the Bordeaux area to Nazi death camps. 
He fled to Switzerland after his conviction but was arrested and began 
serving his sentence in October 1999. During World War II, about 76,000 
Jews, including 12,000 children, were deported from France, many to 
Auschwitz. Only 2,500 survived. (parf-jc-jg)

Even Mickey Mouse is feeling the Iraqi war's pinch. Abdullah Walid's 
7-year-old camel _ named after the American cartoon character _ hasn't 
taken a tourist on a ride around Cairo's Giza pyramids for days now. 
``The war is killing tourism here,'' the 28-year-old father of four 
Walid told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Egyptian authorities paint 
an equally bleak picture, saying that because of the war, 1.5 million 
fewer visitors are expected this year compared to last in a country 
that depends on tourism for much of its hard currency earnings. Tourism 
Minister Mamdouh El-Beltagui predicted Monday that as a result of 
the U.S.-led war, 2003 tourism revenues are expected to fall 38 percent 
to US$2.25 billion. El-Beltagui said in a statement that hotel occupancy 
rates were at 40 percent in the first week of the U.S.-led invasion 
of Iraq, compared to 59 percent this time last year. Late March is 
typically a peak time for Egypt's tourism industry, with thousands 
enjoying the country's warm spring weather, pharaonic sites and Nile 
cruises. This year, the war in Iraq, on top of more than two years 
of Israeli-Palestinian violence and the aftershocks of the Sept. 11 
attacks, has scared most foreign holiday-makers away. Adel Aziz, group 
general manager of top Egyptian tour operator Travco, expected worse 
for his company, predicting a 50 percent drop in business this year. 
He said employees had been asked to take unpaid leaves. Travco has 
received more than 2,000 cancellations from one company alone _ leading 
German tour operator TUI AG _ for March and April, he said. Losses 
of some 20 million Egyptian pounds (US$3.5 million) are expected during 
the same time compared to last year. ``Many clients are seeing Egypt 
as being close to Iraq and think they may be attacked'' because they 
are Western, Aziz told the AP. ``It is a terrible situation because 
nothing is clear.'' Two of the few tourists to visit the pyramids 
Tuesday, British couple Anne and Julian French, said they had no such 
concerns. ``We've had no problem at all, there is so much security 
here it is unbelievable. I feel safer than in Britain,'' said Anne 
French, from the County Kent town of Maidstone, while taking photos 
of the ancient Sphinx. Across town, Cairo's Khan al-Khalili bazaar 
is normally bustling with coach loads of tourists and noisy hawkers. 
But nowadays it resembles a ghost town. ``You just have to see for 
yourself, the streets are still and the shops are empty,'' said Haithem 
Magdi, whose family has run a gift store in the famous souk for 30 
years. ``It hasn't been this way since the (1997) attack in Luxor'' 
by Islamic militants that killed 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians, 
he said. (pg/db)

In statements aimed at smoothing relations with the United States, 
French leaders on Thursday warned against anti-Americanism and said 
they were on the ``side of the democracies'' in the war in Iraq. The 
comments to lawmakers by Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Foreign 
Minister Dominique de Villepin reflected the unease in Paris that 
the French stand against the war could damage ties with Washington. 
``It is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, 
which would be unacceptable,'' spokesman Jean-Francois Cope quoted 
Raffarin as telling representatives of Parliament at a meeting Tuesday 
at the prime minister's office. Villepin, who last week refused to 
answer a reporter's question about whom he wanted to win the war, 
declared on Tuesday in Parliament that France was firmly behind its 
allies. The foreign minister called Saddam Hussein the leader of a 
``cruel and dictatorial regime,'' and said it was France's responsibility 
to back the side of law and peace. ``In the war, this responsibility 
naturally leads France to stand at the side of its allies, on the 
side of the democracies,'' he said, apparently referring to the United 
States and Britain. Villepin's office last week issued a terse statement 
declaring his hope for the victory of the U.S.-led forces in the war 
after media reports suggested that the French diplomat's stand was 
ambiguous. Raffarin and other French officials have made similar statements 
this week. On Monday, the prime minister said France's opposition 
to the war did not mean it considered the United States an enemy. 
Though the government is insisting it wants to see the U.S. coalition 
win, the public appears to be much more ambivalent. A poll by Le Monde 
newspaper and TF1 television station published on Monday said that 
only 34 percent of respondents considered themselves ``on the side'' 
of the U.S.-led forces, while 25 percent said they supported Iraq. 
The telephone poll of 948 people conducted March 28 and 29 said that 
31 percent supported neither side. The survey did not provide a margin 
of error, but polls of that size usually have margins of error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points. The French government has been 
on the defensive recently, clearly concerned that its strident anti-war 
stance is being seen by many on the other side of the Atlantic as 
a betrayal of Washington. ``France does not turn on its friends,'' 
declared Christian Poncelet, the president of the French Senate. ``They 
have taken a position that is not ours, but that in no way dents our 
good relations.'' Lawmaker Jacques Barrot, who leads President Jacques 
Chirac's Union for a Popular Movement in the National Assembly, said 
Paris' opposition to the war should not be read as support for Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein. ``We should not mistake who the enemy is,'' 
Barrot said. ``We cannot allow the glorification of Saddam Hussein.'' 
Portraits of the Iraqi leader are held aloft at anti-war marches in 
France, along with Iraqi flags. The government is also worried about 
the frequent protests against the war becoming a forum for anti-Semitism. 
Raffarin also warned on Tuesday that signs of racism, anti-Semitism 
or xenophobia should not be tolerated. Angry demonstrators attacked 
two young French Jews at a recent demonstration, and a human rights 
group posted monitors along a subsequent anti-war march route to guard 
against displays of anti-Semitism. (parf-jc-eg-jg)

European countries stepped up security at airports and an exhibition 
Tuesday as more cases of a deadly mystery illness from Asia were reported 
in Germany and Spain. Medical experts are looking for travelers _ 
both arriving and departing _ with symptoms of Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome at airports in countries from Russia to Spain. SARS has so 
far killed at least 63 people and sickened more than 1,600 worldwide. 
Early symptoms include fever, dry cough and breathing difficulties. 
A fourth case of the disease was confirmed by authorities in Germany 
on Tuesday, while Spain reported the first suspected case there since 
a false alarm last month. There are already three suspected cases 
in Britain, three in Italy, two in Belgium and one in Slovenia. Switzerland 
records three ``probable'' and four ``suspected'' cases. Most of the 
victims are on the road to recovery, but WHO says the disease is fatal 
in about 4 percent of cases. Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor working 
for the World Health Organization who was the first to identify the 
disease in Vietnam, died himself from SARS last Saturday in Thailand. 
So far all the cases in Europe have been among people who recently 
traveled to Asia, and authorities are keen to keep it that way. Before 
the disease was identified, travelers returning from Asia passed it 
to family members in Canada. There are now 129 suspected cases in 
the country, and a health emergency has been declared in Toronto, 
Canada's largest city. The Swiss cabinet Tuesday banned exhibitors 
from affected countries _ about 350 people, or a sixth of the total 
_ from the Basel World Watch and Jewelry Fair, which opens Thursday. 
German health authorities have drawn up information for distribution 
to travelers before they board a plane bound for Frankfurt airport, 
the biggest air hub in continental Europe, and passengers arriving 
in France from the affected areas, including Toronto, are required 
to fill out forms with their contact details before leaving their 
flights. Governments also are stepping up their advice to citizens 
planning to travel to the affected region, with Belgium and Denmark 
on Tuesday becoming the latest countries to advise their citizens 
against travel. ``If the trip is not essential, it is better to postpone 
it,'' said Belgian Health Minister Jef Tavernier. Belgium's Prince 
Philippe has put off his trade mission to Vietnam, and British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair has postponed a trip to China, though Chinese 
authorities insist that is not linked to SARS. The Geneva-based WHO 
said Tuesday it is considering the unusual move of advising against 
travel to the most heavily affected areas _ Hong Kong and China as 
well as possibly Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan. That follows information 
from Hong Kong authorities that they have been unable to find a link 
between new cases there and patients previously infected. Hong Kong 
invoked a colonial-era law Tuesday to quarantine more than 240 people 
in countryside vacation camps in an attempt to halt the spread of 
the disease. ``It appears that there is now some environmental factor, 
such as water or sewage, which is taking this disease from one human 
to another,'' said Dr. David Heymann, WHO's infectious diseases chief. 
Some sporting events in the region have been canceled, including the 
women's world ice hockey championships scheduled to open this week 
in the Chinese capital, Beijing. World soccer body FIFA said it is 
still studying whether to make schedule changes, including an April 
12 match between Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. The World Economic Forum 
said Tuesday it has postponed until fall a Beijing meeting of business 
and government leaders, and two major United Nations meetings planned 
for Beijing this month also are under threat. ^ _ _ _ _ _ &lt; On

Lambasted for scoring only two goals against soccer minnow Liechtenstein, 
England's stars will be thankful to get a lucky 1-0 victory over World 
Cup semifinalist Turkey on Wednesday. It might not be enough to get 
the critics off their backs. But it will mean moving to the top of 
the group standings and getting back on course for a place in next 
year's European Championship finals. Team captain David Beckham admitted 
that the team had to perform better than in Saturday's 2-0 victory 
over Leichtenstein, one of Europe's weakest teams, if it is to beat 
Turkey. ``We've got to respond,'' the Manchester United star said. 
``There are critics out there and we want to show them we are capable 
of beating this team.'' If England produces a repeat of Saturday's 
tepid 2-0 performance against Liechtenstein it will be unlikely to 
defeat a high quality Turkish team that has virtually all its World 
Cup stars. The squad includes standout goalkeeper Rustu Recber of 
Fenerbahce, Galatasaray's attacking midfielder Hasan Sas, Inter Milan's 
Emre Belozoglu and English-based players Alpay Ozalan (Aston Villa), 
Tugay Kerimoglu and Hakan Sukur (both Blackburn Rovers). A Turkish 
victory would give the World Cup third-place team a five point advantage 
at the top of the group and leave England realistically looking at 
a place in the runners-up playoffs. Beckham knows the Turks are no 
longer the pushovers who have never beaten or even scored against 
England in eight meetings, including two 8-0 thrashings at Istanbul 
(1984) and Wembley ('87). Their last meeting was almost exactly 10 
years ago in a World Cup qualification game in Izmir. England won 
2-0. As well as needing the victory to keep alive its chances of an 
automatic berth in the finals, England's stars may be playing for 
Sven-Goran Eriksson's job. The England coach has been a target for 
major criticism from the media for England's poor performances since 
the World Cup. An unconvincing 2-1 win in Slovakia was followed by 
a 2-2 tie at home to modest Macedonia in another Euro 2004 qualifying 
game. Then came the embarrassment of a 3-1 loss at home to Australia 
at West Ham's Upton Park in a friendly in February. Eriksson has been 
blamed not only for the results but for taking the passion out of 
England's play. The papers say the Swede's low-key, detached personality 
appears to have been passed on to the players. While Ericksson said 
he wouldn't change, Beckham denied the team lacked is usual vigor 
on the field. ``I am England captain and I am personally insulted 
when people suggest I have not got the passion,'' the Manchester United 
captain said. ``It doesn't affect me but it annoys me. ``I also think 
it is a mistake to say the team lack passion. I've not seen any indication 
that the team is lacking that quality and I am the captain and have 
been training with these players day in and day out for the last week.'' 
Eriksson told reporters it was not his character to loose his cool. 
``If you want someone shouting you have to change because that's never 
been my style,'' he said. ``At my age it's not easy and I have no 
intention to change my character. I couldn't do it.'' Eriksson has 
to decide whether to start 17-year-old Everton striker Wayne Rooney 
for the first time, stick with the Liverpool combination of Michael 
Owen and Emile Heskey, move Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes 
forward to partner Owen or leave the Liverpool man on his own in a 
4-5-1 formation. Whatever his selection, Eriksson, who has Arsenal 
centerback Sol Campbell back after an Achilles tendon injury, knows 
victory is vital. ``All of our players know this is a really big game. 
We can't fail if we want to win the group,'' he said. Eriksson said 
he was aware of the criticism aimed at him and the team after the 
drab performance in Liechtenstein. ``I read some of the papers and 
it would have been better not to,'' he said. ``We took three points, 
a professional job done. I know we can play better football of course 
but let's try to do that tomorrow.'' Turkish coach Senol Gunes, whose 
team has maintained its World Cup form by winning all three Euro 2004 
games so far, compared his team's rise with England's performances 
in major championships. ``We have improved a lot,'' he said. ``We 
were quarterfinalists at Euro 2000 and we also came third in the World 
Cup in 2002. England couldn't qualify for the quarterfinals at Euro 
2000 and lost to Brazil in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. ``But 
this doesn't guarantee that we will win this game. The success we 
have had in these two competitions does not matter, neither will the 
record of English teams against Turkey in the past guarantee that 
they will win. ``Previously we haven't scored against England and 
we have only one point,'' Gunes said. ``But we always look to the 
future.'' Police and security staff are expecting a tough night. English 
and Turkish fans are known for sparking violence and, of the 4,000 
tickets sold to the Turkish contingent, some may have gone to Kurdish 
asylum seekers opposed to the Turkish government. Up to 4,000 police 
officers will be on duty at the ground and in the city center. Expected 
lineups: England _ David James, Gary Neville, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, 
Wayne Bridge, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Steven Gerrard, Kieron 
Dyer, Michael Owen, Emile Heskey. Turkey _ Rustu Recber, Fatih Akyel, 
Alpay Ozalan, Bulent Korkmaz, Emre Belozoglu, Umit Davala, Okan Buruk, 
Tugay Kerimoglu, Hasan Sas, Nihat Kahveci, Ilhan Mansiz. (rjm)

The German government has decided against taking part in a new NATO 
naval deployment in the western Mediterranean meant as a precaution 
against terrorist attacks, Defense Minister Peter Struck said Tuesday. 
Struck told reporters that offers from ``enough other NATO states'' 
to provide six speedboats for the mission made German participation 
unnecessary. He did not elaborate. Germany strongly opposes the U.S.-led 
war in Iraq and has refused to contribute troops there, but the government 
insisted that the Mediterranean mission was separate. A German frigate 
is already participating in NATO's Active Endeavor operation to patrol 
the eastern Mediterranean, set up following the Sept. 11 attacks on 
the United States. The alliance finalized plans a month ago to extend 
the naval patrols to the whole Mediterranean Sea up to the Strait 
of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Morocco. Norway already has 
said it was asked to supply torpedo boats for the patrols. Despite 
its opposition to the Iraq war, Germany has a unit trained in detect 
biological and chemical agents stationed in Kuwait as part of Operation 
Enduring Freedom, the U.S.-led anti-terror campaign launched after 
the Sept. 11 attacks. German frigates are also patrolling shipping 
lanes off the Horn of Africa. Close to Iraq, German crew members are 
taking part in flights by NATO surveillance planes over Turkey to 
guard against a possible Iraqi attack. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 
says the AWACS flights _ politically controversial in Germany _ are 
covered by Berlin's obligation to defend a NATO ally and would not 
be used to support the war. An opposition party has unsuccessfully 
asked Germany's supreme court to order a parliamentary vote on the 
AWACS deployment _ something that would test the slim majority of 
Schroeder's center-left coalition. ^ (gm-tc) &lt;

Thrashers defenseman Chris Tamer was suspended indefinitely by the 
NHL for cross-checking Vladimir Orszagh of the Nashville Predators. 
Tamer had a hearing in New York on Monday and missed that night's 
game against the Rangers. A ruling will be made before Wednesday's 
game at Buffalo. Tamer drew a game misconduct on Saturday for intent 
to injure in the second period of the Thrashers' 3-2 victory at Nashville. 
He hit Orszagh in apparent retaliation for a hit on Dany Heatley by 
Nashville's Rem Murray. Orszagh left the game with a shoulder injury. 
With Tamer out, Kurtis Foster was recalled from Chicago of the AHL 
and made his NHL debut Monday night against the Rangers.

Ukraine has lifted its 15-month-old ban on imports of U.S. poultry, 
the country's top veterinary official said Tuesday. Petro Verbytskyi, 
head of the Veterinary Department in the Agriculture Ministry, announced 
the decision after returning from Washington where an agreement to 
clear the way for imports was signed. During their four-day visit, 
Ukrainian veterinary officials certified that U.S. chicken could be 
imported ``if no antibiotics or chemicals were used,'' Verbytskyi 
said. In this case, ``no barriers exist to import poultry from the 
United States,'' he added. Prior to the ban's imposition in January 
2002, U.S. producers supplied some 90 percent of all chicken imports 
to Ukraine. Ukraine imposed the ban because the American poultry industry 
widely uses antibiotics and chemicals to stimulate chicken growth, 
as well as preservatives and disinfecting substances to keep meat 
fresh. Such chemicals are banned in Ukraine, although U.S. officials 
insist such chicken is safe to eat. Verbytskyi said Ukraine's legislation 
banning chemical additives and growth stimulants is a holdover from 
Soviet times that is ripe for change. Ukraine imported 69,000 metric 
tons (76,060 tons) of chicken in 2001. (am/tv/jh)

House Republicans on Tuesday proposed giving President George W. Bush 
the entire $74.7 billion he wants to begin paying for the war with 
Iraq and anti-terrorism costs, but clamping down on the flexibility 
he sought in deciding how to spend the money. The Republican-run House 
Appropriations Committee began debating the measure on Tuesday in 
hopes of approving the legislation quickly, as Bush has requested. 
Committee Chairman Bill Youn called the bill ``a message to our troops 
that we believe in them, that we support them and that we encourage 
them.'' The Senate Appropriations Committee, also led by Republicans, 
planned to vote on a similar package later in the day that would also 
put tighter congressional controls on spending the money. When Bush 
sent his request to Congress last week, he asked lawmakers to rush 
the funds to him by April 11. For the most part, the House plan followed 
the broad outlines that Bush requested. It would provide $62.5 billion 
of the $62.6 billion he proposed for the Pentagon and classified activities; 
$200 million more than the $7.8 billion he requested for foreign aid; 
and $69 million less than the nearly $4.3 billion he proposed for 
tightening security at home. But the House measure would greatly restrict 
Bush's proposal for large pools of money that the administration could 
spend with little control by lawmakers. That reflects a long-standing 
desire by lawmakers of both parties to protect Congress's power to 
control spending. As Bush proposed, the House bill would provide $1 
billion for Israel, $1 billion for Turkey, at least $700 million for 
Jordan, and more funds for other allies. An extra $250 million was 
added for food aid.

Widespread abuse by police in Romania's overcrowded prisons resulted 
in three deaths from 2001-2002, according to a U.S. State Department 
report released Tuesday by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. In the report, 
the State Department concluded that Romania's human rights record 
has been improving in recent years as the former communist country 
moves toward a market economy and democracy. But there was still room 
for improvement, it added. ``The government generally respected the 
human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some 
areas,'' the report said. ``Police use of excessive force resulted 
in three deaths.'' In March 2002, a prisoner identified as Mihai Iorga 
died after police officers beat him over the head with a hammer. He 
lapsed into a coma, but received no medical treatment. In another 
case, police beat to death an 18-year-old Roma, or Gypsy, man in a 
prison in the town of Jilava, just south of Bucharest. The two police 
officers who had carried out the beatings were subsequently demoted. 
While in some cases police officers suspected of abuse lost their 
jobs or faced criminal charges, all too often the system failed to 
punish those responsible for abuses, the report said. ``Investigations 
of police abuses generally were lengthy and inconclusive and rarely 
resulted in prosecution or punishment,'' the report said. The interior 
and justice ministries refused comment, saying they had not yet received 
the report. The report said that while some progress had resulted 
from efforts to reform the police system, ``at times authorities violated 
the prohibition against arbitrary arrest and detention.'' ``Prison 
conditions remained harsh and overcrowding remained a serious problem,'' 
the report also said. (am/vg)

European Union officials plan to tell U.S. Secretary of State Colin 
Powell when they meet Thursday that the United Nations must play the 
central role in rebuilding postwar Iraq. EU spokeswoman Emma Udwin 
said Tuesday that senior diplomats from the 15-nation union would 
stress that it was their ``primary concern to have the U.N. center 
stage.'' ``We believe the U.N. system has a unique capacity and experience 
in post-conflict states,'' she said, adding, ``The U.N. should play 
a central role during and after the crisis.'' Powell is scheduled 
to be in Brussels on Thursday for talks with EU and NATO officials 
as well as Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. For security reasons, 
Powell plans to meet an EU delegation led by Greek Foreign Minister 
George Papandreou at NATO headquarters. Officials said the decision 
not to let Powell visit the EU head office, only 3 kilometers (2 miles) 
away, was not connected to the recent discovery of listening devices 
in meeting rooms at the EU complex. ``We expect (Powell) to discuss 
the war in Iraq and ... whatever will happen postwar,'' Udwin said. 
But she said the EU was not ready to discuss postwar specifics because 
the war itself still appeared to be in its early days. ``This meeting 
comes too early for us to discuss detailed plans,'' she said. ``It 
is important that we carry on discussions during the conflict.'' Given 
the souring of transatlantic relations in recent months, she said 
it was ``encouraging'' that Powell was coming to Brussels. In Athens, 
Greek government spokesman Christos Protopapas said he wished Powell 
had come to the EU in the runup to the war. ``Nevertheless, if he 
wants to talk on these issues, it is never too late,'' Protopapas 
said. The Iraq war has divided the EU nations and 13 mostly East European 
nations seeking admission. Germany and France lead a no-war camp. 
Britain, Spain, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal and several 
East European candidate nations have sided with the United States. 
Greece, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, has been 
unable to bridge the rift. Instead it has focused discussions on matters 
of agreement, such as Iraq's eventual reconstruction and the likely 
U.N. role in that work. French President Jacques Chirac emerged from 
an EU summit March 21 warning that neither Britain nor the United 
States should lead any postwar administration in Iraq. He said allowing 
this would legitimize the invasion of Iraq. The leaders of the EU 
delegation meeting Powell will be Papandreou, EU External Relations 
Commissioner Chris Patten, and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and 
security affairs chief. Patten said recently that unless the United 
Nations gets a lead role in rebuilding Iraq, it will be difficult 
for EU governments to provide significant reconstruction funding. 
Before Powell left for his trip to Turkey and Brussels, U.S. State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he wanted to discuss the 
possible European contribution to a postwar peacekeeping force in 
Iraq. ``We have allies with different views. We will be talking about 
that,'' Boucher said. ``The issue at this moment for us and the Europeans 
on the diplomatic track is to look at what is going on in Iraq, not 
in terms of the past, but in terms of what we can do to give the Iraqis 
a better future.'' (rw-rac/sp)

The federal government on Tuesday ordered all airports in India to 
screen passengers coming from countries hit by a deadly mystery disease, 
a news report said. Airline officials have been directed to keep a 
lookout for passengers who display symptoms of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome, or SARS, the Press Trust of India news agency said. Scientists 
have yet to identify the disease that has killed at least 63 people, 
mostly in Asia, and sickened more than 1,600 globally. Airline staff 
have been told to inform authorities if they find people with symptoms 
associated with the illness, such as a dry cough and fever, and airport 
doctors have been ordered to be on duty round the clock, Press Trust 
of India said. ``Authorities have been asked to keep a close watch 
on passengers coming from 15 countries where the risk of the disease 
is high,'' PTI quoted civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain as 
saying. He did not list the countries. China, Hong Kong, Singapore, 
and Vietnam have been among the hardest hit countries. Officials were 
not immediately available to comment on the report. Meanwhile, in 
the southern port town of Madras, passengers and crew of a Canadian 
cruise ship were screened by port authorities for the disease, a port 
official said Tuesday. The ``Seawing,'' which arrived in Madras on 
Sunday from Canada via Singapore, had 900 people on board, including 
637 passengers, the official said on condition of anonymity. At least 
four people have died in Canada from SARS. All passengers and crew 
were cleared and the ship was allowed to dock. The vessel then sailed 
for Colombo, Sri Lanka, later Sunday.

One soldier's trash is a Kurdish boy's treasure. A landfill near a 
U.S.-occupied air strip in Iraq's Kurdish region draws a swarm of 
local kids rummaging for leftovers from the paratroopers' rations. 
It's a crash course in American military cuisine. One boy grimaced 
as he licked some instant coffee mix. They gawked at the miniature 
bottles of Tabasco hot pepper sauce included in the MREs, or ``meals 
ready to eat,'' from the airfield near Bashur, where paratroopers 
from the 173rd U.S. Airborne Brigade arrived last week. The gum and 
candy are big hits. But the boys can't seem to fathom dishes such 
as tortellini or beef stroganoff in the vacuum-sealed pouches. ``No, 
don't!'' cried one of the boys as his friend tried to taste some chewing 
tobacco. A prize find is peanut butter or grape jelly. The boys have 
learned they go well on crackers, which apparently get thrown away 
in abundance by the soldiers. ``I have lots of crackers, but not much 
to put on them,'' said one boy. Then a trade was struck: one packet 
of grape jelly for three pre-moistened towelettes. Both boys seemed 
happy. ^ _ _ _ &lt; What price war? Iraqi Kurds can tell you exactly. 
Costs for food and many consumer items have skyrocketed in the Western-protected 
Kurdish enclave since the fighting started. The landlocked region 
depends on goods coming over the border from neighbors such as Iran 
and Turkey. Prewar commerce even flowed between Baghdad-controlled 
Iraq and the Kurds, who are among Saddam Hussein's strongest opponents. 
Tomatoes used to sell for one dinar (about 14 U.S. cents) for a kilogram 
(2.2 pounds) at the current exchange rate in the Kurdish zone. Now 
they cost 15 dinars (about US$2). A kilo of oranges has shot from 
four dinars (56 U.S. cents) to 10 dinars (US$1.40). The price for 
a kilo of cucumbers has more than doubled to seven dinars (nearly 
US$1). And the pinch extends from the market to the kitchen. A large 
canister of cooking propane _ used in many Kurdish kitchens _ has 
gone from about 25 dinars (about US$3.50) to 90 dinars (close to US$13), 
which is several days' pay for many Kurds. Gas prices spiked last 
week at more than four times prewar levels _ reaching above 100 dinars 
(about US$14) for a 20-liter (about 5 gallons) can sold by curbside 
peddlers. Prices have fallen a bit since the fighting has been contained 
mostly to southern Iraq. ``I tell them the prices and they laugh and 
then they cry,'' said greengrocer Ziad Massoud. ^ _ _ _ &lt; The boom 
rattled the windows. Was it a U.S. air strike at frontline Iraqi positions? 
Were the Iraqis shelling the Kurdish town of Kalak just over the river 
from their outposts? Foreign journalists raced outside into a downpour. 
``What was it?'' they asked a Kurdish man. He struggled to explain 
in English. Then came a loud thunder clap. The man smiled and pointed 
to the sky. ``No bomb,'' he said. ``Allah boom boom.'' ^ _ _ _ &lt; 
Internet cafes have already declared victory in the war. The many 
Internet sites in the Kurdish zone are continually mobbed by journalists 
filing stories and Kurds keeping up on war developments. Many owners 
have extended their hours to meet the demand. A popular screensaver 
image is Saddam Hussein trying to dodge U.S. missiles until finally 
disappearing after a direct hit. ^ _ _ _ &lt; The world can follow 
the battlefield on television. Some Kurds can see it live from the 
safety of their own homes. In the front line town of Kalak, Kurds 
watch U.S. warplanes strike the Iraqi positions on a ridge less than 
a kilometer (about half a mile) away. Some families sipped their morning 
tea as they gathered on roofs with a view: bombs sending up towering 
columns of deep gray smoke. Shepherds left their sheep to graze as 
they clambered to hilltops. Children paused their games for a moment 
after a particularly gut-shaking blast. Then they went back to play. 
Markets were open. Police directed traffic. The Zab River was like 
a line separating war's spectacle and its horror. On the western bank, 
Iraqi soldiers ran for the lives from the relentless onslaught. Across 
the river in Kalak people just watched.

A Cuban Airlines plane hijacked by a man claiming to have two grenades 
and demanding to go to Florida took off Tuesday after a group of passengers 
safely left the craft. The Soviet-made AN-24 plane took off from Jose 
Marti International Airport about 10:45 a.m. (1525 GMT) for an unknown 
destination. It also was unknown whether the hijacker was still aboard. 
The plane has a listed range of about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) with 
a full load of fuel, but aircraft in energy-conscious Cuba often fly 
only with enough fuel necessary for a safe trip to their scheduled 
destination. Miami, a common destination for people leaving Cuba, 
is about 220 miles (350 km) from Havana. Earlier Tuesday, two separate 
groups of as many as two dozen passengers, including a woman holding 
a small child, jumped from the open back hatch of the plane into the 
arms of emergency workers. The passengers then boarded buses and were 
driven off the runway. Later, two white cars drove onto the airport 
tarmac and a man aboard one car handed three large, stuffed plastic 
bags to someone inside the plane. It was unknown what was inside the 
bags. Cuban authorities originally reported six children among the 
46 people aboard the hijacked craft. It was not immediately clear 
what led to the passengers' release almost 12 hours after the man 
seized control of the plane and demanded to be flown to Florida. The 
Cuban Airlines AN-24 was hijacked late Monday on a flight from Cuba's 
small Isle of Youth to Havana but was forced to land in the capital 
because it lacked sufficient fuel to make it to the United States, 
Cuban authorities said. Shortly after daybreak, a tank with a hose 
was rolled out onto the tarmac and appeared to be refueling the craft. 
The plane was surrounded by several dozen uniformed police officers, 
and two fire trucks and numerous ambulances were parked nearby. It 
would be extremely difficult for an average citizen to get access 
to grenades in communist-run Cuba, where such weapons are heavily 
guarded by the military. It was also unclear how anyone would get 
a pair of grenades through the heavy security checks at Cuba's airports, 
especially less than two weeks after a successful hijacking on the 
same route of a passenger plane to the United States. All incoming 
and outgoing air traffic at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport 
appeared suspended during the negotiations. An Iberia Airlines flight 
to Madrid was grounded and photographers and cameramen at the scene 
said that they had seen no takeoffs or landings for several hours. 
A government statement said the Soviet-made Cuban Airlines plane was 
on a regular passenger flight from the Isle of Youth's main city of 
Nueva Gerona when the pilot reported that the craft was being hijacked 
to the United States by a man armed with grenades. ``The Cuban authorities, 
for their part, will undertake the maximum effort to find a solution 
that preserves the safety and lives of passengers and crew members,'' 
said the statement. The statement blamed the hijacking attempt on 
what Havana says is the lax treatment that six other suspected hijackers 
received last month after successfully forcing another plane from 
Cuba to Key West, Fla., at knifepoint. The suspects in the earlier 
successful hijack were charged with conspiracy to seize an aircraft 
by force and violence and face a minimum of up to 20 years in federal 
prison. They were granted bond, but remain behind bars because they 
have been unable to come up with the money. Cuban authorities were 
pleased that American officials decided to charge the six but were 
enraged last week when a federal judge decided to set bond over the 
objections of prosecutors. ``The entire responsibility of what could 
happen (in the latest hijack attempt) will fall on the government 
of that country,'' the Cuban statement said of the United States. 
In the March 19 hijacking, six crew members and 25 passengers were 
on a twin-engine Douglas DC-3 on the same route when knife-wielding 
hijackers took control of the plane as it descended toward Havana 
after a trip from the Isle of Youth. They diverted the plane to Key 
West. Sixteen of those aboard later opted to return to Cuba and the 
only non-Cuban on the flight, an Italian, was released in the United 
States. The rest of the passengers and crew members on that earlier 
flight opted to stay in the United States under a U.S. immigration 
policy that allows Cubans who reach American soil to stay and seek 
legal residency after a year.

an EU summit March 21 warning that neither Britain nor the United 
States should lead any postwar administration in Iraq. He said allowing 
this would legitimize the invasion of Iraq. The leaders of the EU 
delegation meeting Powell will be Papandreou, EU External Relations 
Commissioner Chris Patten, and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign and 
security affairs chief. Patten said recently that unless the United 
Nations gets a lead role in rebuilding Iraq, it will be difficult 
for EU governments to provide significant reconstruction funding. 
Before Powell left for his trip to Turkey and Brussels, U.S. State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he wanted to discuss the 
possible European contribution to a postwar peacekeeping force in 
Iraq. ``We have allies with different views. We will be talking about 
that,'' Boucher said. ``The issue at this moment for us and the Europeans 
on the diplomatic track is to look at what is going on in Iraq, not 
in terms of the past, but in terms of what we can do to give the Iraqis 
a better future.'' (rw-rac/sp)
