Yoshiyuki Kamei became Japan's new farm minister Tuesday, replacing 
Tadamori Oshima who resigned a day earlier over a money scandal involving 
a former aide. Kamei, a former transport minister, immediately pledged 
cooperation with the European Union in liberalising farm trade, one 
day after the passing of a deadline for establishing a framework for 
talks on the issue. "By continuing to closely cooperate with the European 
Union and other parties, we will strive to seek a realistic and balanced 
agreement," he said at a press conference. Kamei, 66, is a seasoned 
member of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party and has been elected 
to the House of Representatives seven times since 1979. He served 
as transport minister in 1996 under then prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. 
Kamei's predecessor, Oshima, took the post in a cabinet reshuffle 
last September but refused to leave the job after the scandal came 
to light. In February, Oshima admitted that a building owner from 
his constituency in Hachinohe city in northern Japan gave an aide 
six million yen (50,000 dollars) for election campaigning in June 
2000. The aide frittered away the money without keeping records and 
hiding the matter from Oshima. He was later dismissed. sps/rcw Japan-politics-scandal-Kamei

US claims victory against alleged al-Qaeda linked group in northern 
Iraq by Stefan Smith = (PICTURES) = HALABJA, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - 
A US Special Forces team asserted Tuesday that a joint operation with 
local Kurds against an alleged al-Qaeda-linked group in northern Iraq 
had been a resounding success, with initial investigations turning 
up evidence of chemical weapons production. Speaking during a rare 
appearance before the press, seven special forces officers said Ansar 
al-Islam (Supporters of Islam) was now "neutralised", even though 
many of the group's fighters may have escaped over the border to neighbouring 
Iran. "It was pretty damn succesful. In a period of one-and-a-half 
days, a terrorist organisation that has had a grip on this region 
was rooted out and neutralised," said one of the officers during the 
briefing in Halabja, a town in the southeast of the Iraqi Kurd autonomous 
zone. "There was a lot of fighting. The Ansar al-Islam and al-Qaeda 
were not a pushover," the officer said. None of the team, decked out 
in battle fatigues, gave their names. Citing "anecdotal evidence", 
the team said there were "several hundred" Ansar casualties. The group 
had an estimated 700 members, of which 75-100 were believed to be 
al-Qaeda veterans from Afghanistan. Scores of US Special Forces were 
flown into the Kurdish north to help a pro-US Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
(PUK) defeat Ansar, a Taliban-style group which emerged in late 2001 
and has been blamed for a spate of suicide bombings and assassinations. 
Ansar's presence in mountainous terrain between Halabja and the Iranian 
border was one of the many reasons given by Washington as justification 
for an invasion of Iraq. The group featured in a presentation to the 
United Nations Security Council in February by US Secretary of State 
Colin Powell, who said it could potentially channel weapons of mass 
destruction allegedly held by Saddam Hussein to Osama bin Laden's 
al-Qaeda network. The attack on Ansar included some 8-10,000 PUK peshmerga 
fighters, and the special forces contribution was "less than one percent 
of that number", the US officers said. They said initial finds in 
Ansar areas, captured last week after a six-pronged assault backed 
up by AC-130 gunships and B-52 bombers on an area totalling some 400 
square kilometers (180 square miles), had yielded valuable evidence. 
"There were things found on the site that to my mind confirmed chemical 
or biological weapons activity. Much of the evidence is under the 
rubble and the exploitation of the site is ongoing," one of the team 
said, adding that soil samples and material evidence had been sent 
to the US for analysis. PUK military sources said they had also found 
a number of foreign passports and lists of contact numbers and addresses 
in the United States and Europe -- which they assert backs up their 
claims that Ansar is an international menace and not just a local 
irritation. Despite the upbeat presentation, the US team was cautious 
when asked to respond to reports that scores of Ansar fighters -- 
as well as some leaders of the group -- had escaped to Iran. "We know 
some of them were able to escape over the border to Iran," one of 
the officers said, but diplomatically emphasised that the frontier 
-- a long ridge of snow-capped mountain peaks -- was "very porous 
and difficult to control". Iran denies allegations that it supports 
Al-Ansar. The ousting of the group from its territory will also enable 
the PUK and US special forces here to focus their attentions on the 
northern front against Baghdad. However,the Special Forces team refused 
to discuss future operations. sas/mb Iraq-war-Kurds-US-Ansar

The provisional results of a parliamentary election in the small west 
African state of Benin will be released by Wednesday, the chairman 
of the national electoral commission, Ibrahima Adam Soule, has announced. 
People in Benin went to the polls on Sunday to elect a new national 
assembly, where President Mathieu Kerekou's supporters have said they 
were keen to win an uncontested and "clear majority". "The centralisation 
(of ballot results) is already complete," Soule told AFP on Tuesday. 
"In any event the results will be released tomorrow at the latest. 
That's the final date." "Some trends will be made public on Tuesday 
evening," he added. A national polling institute on Monday released 
estimates indicating that opponents of Kerekou had won a large majority 
in the two main towns, Cotonou, the seat of government, and the capital 
Porto Novo, both in the south. Kerekou, a former military ruler who 
stepped down after the country's first multi-party elections in 1991 
but was re-elected a decade later, has traditionally seen most of 
his support in the north of the country. Around 3.1 million people 
were registered to vote to pick the 83 members of the new national 
assembly from 1,162 candidates from 14 parties and political alliances, 
but apathy reportedly prevailed and voter turnout was low. The outgoing 
parliament is divided, with the ruling coalition holding 41 seats 
against 38 for the opposition. Both groups are in a heated race to 
garner a clear majority in the one-chamber assembly. Kerekou on Sunday 
urged the electorate to turn up in hordes. "I am appealing to all 
my compatriots who hold voters' cards to come out massively to choose 
their candidate," he said after casting his ballot in Cotonou. "In 
principle, nobody should abstain from voting. It is a duty for everyone 
to come out once in four or five years to vote." But an AFP correspondent 
at one Cotonou polling station reported that four hours after voting 
began, only 20 of the 408 registered voters there had cast their ballots. 
A local election official said: "This situation does not suprise me. 
"The Beninese are not used to this tempo to vote three times in about 
three months," he said, referring to local and municipal elections 
staged in December and January. "What is important is peace and discipline 
and these were observed during polling." Some voters gave other reasons. 
"Some people wanted to vote but they lost their voters' cards. I know 
many such cases in my area," a man said. Among the political groups 
fielding candidates were the ruling coalition, the Union for the Benin 
of the Future (UBF); the main opposition Renaissance of Benin (RB) 
led by former president Nicephore Soglo; and the Party for Democratic 
Renewal (PRD) headed by Adrien Houngbedji, the mayor of Benin's capital 
Porto Novo. Soglo, a former World Bank official, won Benin's first 
multi-party polls in 1991 and served as president until 1996, when 
he lost elections to Kerekou. ek-eg/nb/kdz Benin-vote

A senior US commander in the war on Iraq said here Tuesday he was 
unable to confirm reports that a US warplane attacked a bus in weswtern 
Iraq carrying international volunteers acting as human shields. "I 
am not aware of any reports of human shields, I cannot confirm that 
and have no information at all," Brigadier General Vincent Brooks 
told reporters here at US Central Command's forward planning base. 
Earlier Tuesday Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf 
said in Baghdad that several people were wounded when a US warplane 
attacked two Iraqi buses carrying international volunteers, some of 
them American, who had been operating as human shields. He said the 
attack took place Monday in the western town of Rutba between Baghdad 
and neighbouring Jordan. nh/mb Iraq-war-US-shields-comment

Israel and the United States locked horns Tuesday over the implementation 
of a US-backed peace plan, with Washington reportedly saying it will 
publish the "roadmap" despite Israeli demands that further changes 
be made. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stressed after a meeting 
with US President George W. Bush that the Palestinians had to fight 
"terrorism" before any implementation of the peace plan. But Bush, 
facing a tougher than expected campaign in Iraq and with mounting 
tension in the Arab world, insisted he was "serious" about pushing 
ahead with the step-by-step plan to forge a Palestinian state, Israeli 
public radio said. "I said clearly there cannot be two parallel paths: 
the war against terrorism in the day and negotiations at night," Shalom 
told the radio in Washington. "The end of terrorism constitutes the 
central question for a return to negotiations with the Palestinians," 
he said. Shalom, who was making his first visit to Washington since 
being named foreign minister last month, met Bush late Monday when 
the US leader dropped in on talks he was holding with US national 
security advisor Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
He also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. The roadmap is 
a plan setting out the steps to Palestinian statehood by the year 
2005. Based on a Bush speech on the Middle East last June, it was 
drafted by US, UN, EU and Russian diplomats, but Israel has raised 
a number of objections. Foremost among its complaints is the fear 
that the plan might progress from one phase to the next without really 
tackling the problem of powerful militant groups attacking Israel. 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's advisor Dov Weisglass has said he would 
like a US mechanism to judge when the conditions have been met to 
move from phase to phase, sidelining the United Nations and European 
Union, with which Israel has cool relations. Israel has reportedly 
proposed 100 changes to the roadmap as drafted, and convinced the 
United States to delay its publication, despite European objections, 
until after its January 28 elections. It has since been further delayed 
as the moderate new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmud Abbas, forms 
his own cabinet, in a move meant to sideline veteran Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat, seen by Israel and Washington as an obstacle to peace. 
But Israeli public radio quoted sources in Washington as saying that 
the US administration did not intend to make any changes to the roadmap 
and that it would be published "as it was". Palestinian officials 
have complained at the repeated delays in finalising the much-debated 
plan, unfavourably comparing the speed with which the United States 
and Britain went to war with Iraq and the apparent foot-dragging on 
the peace plan. Chief negotiator Saeb Erakat accused Israel of stalling 
the roadmap. "The statement by Shalom in the White House is an Israeli 
rejection of the roadmap," he told AFP. "Israel is working to thwart 
any efforts to try to bring the peace process back on track. Shalom 
is challenging the White House and creating the basis for a continuing 
rejection of the roadmap," he said. Meanwhile, Washington chided both 
Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) over human rights abuses, 
noting "problems" with Israel's treatment of Israeli Arabs while accusing 
the Palestinian administration of having a "poor" human rights record 
and continuing "to commit numerous, serious abuses." The State Department's 
annual rights report said members of the Palestinian security forces 
and Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO) took part in anti-Israel violence and terrorist attacks. It 
said that while there was no proof of official approval of such acts, 
some endorsed the use of violence in principle in a violation of commitments 
to halt attacks on Israelis. "The PLO and PA have not complied with 
most of their commitments, notably those relating to the renunciation 
of violence and terrorism, taking responsibility for all PLO elements, 
and disciplining violators," it said. Israeli forces occupying almost 
the entire West Bank also destroyed the houses of two Palestinian 
militants, including the family home of an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber 
who injured some 30 people on Sunday in a seaside resort. Israel has 
demolished more than 200 homes belonging to militants to deter future 
suicide attacks, but critics have slammed the policy as collective 
punishment. bur-jh/mb Mideast

A man suspected of setting off bombs at two prestigious Beijing universities, 
injuring nine people, has been formally charged and is being tried 
in court, state media said Tuesday. Huang Minxiang, a 27-year-old 
who was arrested last month, was tried in the Beijing Number One Intermediate 
People's Court Tuesday, the Xinhua news agency said. The report said 
Huang confessed to setting off the two explosions, which struck the 
Beijing University and Tsinghua University campuses within 90 minutes 
of each other on February 25. The blasts happened days before the 
start of the National People's Congress session which endorsed China's 
most profound leadership changes in a decade. Prosecutors alleged 
in court that Huang came up to Beijing by train on February 21 with 
the intent of carrying out the explosions. He brought with him gunpowder 
and other devices and went to the campuses to choose a location to 
place the bombs. He made the bombs, with timers, at his room at a 
Beijing hostel and from 11am to 1pm on February 25, placed the explosive 
devices at Tsinghua University's Heyuan cantine and Peking University's 
Nongyuan cantine and set off the bombs, the report said. None of the 
nine injured were seriously hurt. The blasts causes damages of 220,000 
yuan (26,500 US dollars) to the cantines. Huang fled, but was later 
captured in Fuzhou, capital of the southeastern province of Fujian, 
where he lived. Students at the time said they believed the blasts 
were carried out by someone with a grudge against the government, 
not the students or faculty. The first branch of the Beijing People's 
Procuratorate charged Huang with premeditated bombing "to create influence." 
Xinhua had previously said Huang told police he carried out the attacks 
to "achieve fame." The exact reasons why Huang carried out the blasts 
was not revealed. Chinese authorities have a habit of making no reference 
to crime suspects' gripes against the government. The court will set 
a later date for announcing the verdict and sentence. Huang worked 
at the Hongshan Hongfeng Agricultural Development Company in Haikou 
city in south China's Hainan province, Xinhua said. cs/rcw China-blast-trial

Oman on Tuesday introduced an exit toll for vehicles crossing its 
borders in a bid to boost non-oil revenues in the face of reduced 
crude output. Cars, taxis and minibuses will have to pay two rials 
(six dollars) on leaving the sultanate, while vehicles weighing 7 
tonnes and more will be charged eight rials. Trucks transporting agricultural, 
livestock and fish products for marketing outside Oman will pay an 
annual fee of 20 rials and stone quarry lorries operating near the 
border 100 rials. The toll will be automated from July 1. Citizens 
in border areas who travel daily and buses hired by the education 
ministry to carry students have been exempted from the fee. Oman, 
which is not an OPEC member, is currently producing about 763,000 
barrels a day, down from 850,000 in 2001. str/lp/bp/mb Oman-oil-travel-toll

The Dutch airline KLM announced on Tuesday that it expects to cut 
thousands of jobs because of the adverse effects on air transport 
of the War in Iraq and the spreading of the SARS virus. "Based on 
an interim inventory of longer-term initiatives, KLM expects to cut 
several thousand jobs," the statement said. According to a KLM spokesman 
the company was already planning to restructure. "Due to the war in 
Iraq and the outbreak of the SARS epidemic we are forced to speed 
up our restructuring plans", he told AFP. KLM announced a general 
recruitment stop effective immediately, contracts of temporary workers 
will not be renewed and the hiring of external personnel will be almost 
completely suspended. In spite of these measures KLM warns that forced 
lay-offs will also be required. "Part of the job cuts will be effective 
before March 31, 2004," the spokesman said. sb/hd Netherlands-air-company-jobs-KLM

Civilian losses are regrettable but unavoidable in war, a senior US 
commander said here Tuesday a day after US troops killed seven women 
and children in a van at a military checkpoint. "Our efforts may result 
in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result in the 
loss of Iraqi military lives," Brigadier General Vincent Brooks told 
a press briefing here at the US Central Command's forward planning 
base. "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they remain 
unavoidable as they have been throughout history." Brooks had been 
asked if the checkpoint shooting, which took place near Najaf in southern 
Iraq, would affect the coalition's efforts to win "the hearts and 
minds" of the people of Iraq. US military officials said US troops 
opened fire on the vehicle after it ignored two warnings to stop. 
Four civilians were injured in the attack, according to US officials. 
Iraqi officials claim more than 600 civilians have been killed in 
air bombardments on Baghdad and other attacks across the country since 
the start of the US-led war against President Saddam Hussein on March 
20. nh/mb Iraq-war-US-civilians

The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Tuesday it -- and not 
the United States -- was responsible for checking that Iraq did not 
possess any atomic weapons, after a report that Washington wanted 
to set up unilateral weapons inspections. "The IAEA is the sole body 
with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear disarmament," the head 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, 
said in a statement. "The world has learned over three decades that 
only through impartial, international inspections can credibility 
be generated. Iraq is no exception to that requirement." ElBaradei's 
comments came after the Washington Post Sunday said the US administration 
had set up special military units to seek out the weapons of mass 
destruction it accuses Iraq of developing. Hans Blix, the head of 
the UN inspection team responsible for verifying whether Iraq possesses 
any banned chemical and biological arms, said on Saturday that the 
US and London were trying to recruit his inspectors to work on a unilateral 
weapons search programme. "They have turned to some people who currently 
work for us and asked them to come down and help. These are our people 
who come from countries that are engaged in the conflict down there," 
Blix said. The inspection teams led by ElBaradei and Blix were evacuated 
from Iraq two days before the US-British invasion of Iraq, less than 
four months into the verification mission the United Nations Security 
Council had asked them to undertake. ElBaradei -- who on March 7 said 
UN experts had found no sign of any prohibited nuclear activity at 
any inspected site in Iraq -- said on Tuesday the weapons teams hoped 
to continue their work once the war was over. "The IAEA mandate in 
Iraq is still valid and has not changed," he said. "Our operation 
is interrupted because of hostilities. "We expect to go back with 
full authority after the cessation of hostilities, to resume our inspection 
activities in Iraq pursuant to the mandate given to us both by the 
Security Council and by the fact that Iraq is a party to the NPT (nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty) . "Impartial and independent verification 
is at the core of international efforts over the last 30 years to 
underpin the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," he continued. 
"We had made good progress since resuming inspections in Iraq in November 
and we stand ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume 
our work after the war and to provide the ongoing assurances sought 
by the Security Council that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme."

Deutsche Boerse, the company which operates the German stock exchange, 
said Tuesday a total 6.7 million transactions were executed on its 
electronic trading platform, Xetra, in March, 36.7 percent more than 
in February. The previous record was 6.6 million transactions in October 
2002. The strong rise in the number of transactions was attributable 
to investor nervousness in face of the Iraq crisis. In addition, March 
had three more trading days than February, a spokeswoman for Deutsche 
Boerse said. The value of the transactions amounted to 266.8 billion 
euros (291 billion dollars) in March, compared with 223.3 billion 
euros in February and 324.6 billion euros in March 2002. The Frankfurt 
stock exchange accounts for 99 percent of all stock transactions in 
Germany, with the rest executed by smaller regional exchanges. The 
futures exchange, Eurex, in which Deutsche Boerse holds a 50-percent 
stake, also reported a record 106 million transactions in March, 69 
percent more than in March 2002. The previous record of 86.6 million 
transactions was set in October 2002. spm/hd Germany-stocks-finance-services-company-DeutscheBoerse

Polish Health Minister Marek Balicki resigned Tuesday in a further 
blow to the leftist government of Prime Minister Leszek Miller. The 
resignation, announced officially by the government press service, 
came on the same day that a program reforming the central European 
country's health care services took effect. Public radio said Balicki 
had resigned to protest Miller's nomination of a former deputy health 
minister Aleksander Nauman to head a central agency that will manage 
a health fund. Balicki has opposed Nauman's nomination. Miller accepted 
the resignation and asked Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski 
to nominate Ewa Kralkowska of the socialist Democratic Labour Union, 
a coalition member, to replace Balicki. Balicki's resignation further 
adds to the woes of Miller's government, which has been in a minority 
since dropping the Polish Peasant Party from its coalition in early 
March. A poll by the OBOP agency published on Tuesday and conducted 
between March 8-10 showed 75 percent of the population disapprove 
of the government, while only 17 percent approved. The government's 
ratings have slipped steadily this year, with 60 percent disappoving 
of its performance in January and 70 percent disapproving of it in 
February, according to polls. mrm/jmy/yad Poland-politics

US troops kill seven women, children in setback to hearts and minds 
campaign by Lachlan Carmichael ATTENTION - ADDS US press, ICRC comments/// 
NEAR NAJAF, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and 
children when they opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military 
checkpoint, in a severe blow for coalition efforts to win the trust 
of the Iraqi people. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned 
by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, US spokesman 
Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims 
were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite hand signals and repeated 
warning shots fired by US troops, who then fired at the passenger 
compartment as a last resort. Citing officers on the scene, he said 
the civilians were killed by 25mm gunfire, with one man -- apparently 
the driver -- so badly injured he was not expected to live. US forces 
in Iraq have been on a heightened state of alert and are approaching 
Iraqi civilians with much greater caution following a suicide car 
bombing near Najaf on Saturday that killed four soldiers. Well before 
Saturday's car bomb, US officers had been making no secret of their 
outrage at the guerrilla tactics they said had been practiced by Iraqi 
forces -- firing from civilian vehicles, faking surrenders only to 
open fire, fighting behind human shields. Troops on the ground have 
also been frustrated -- and surprised -- by Iraqi forces they say 
don civilian clothes and then melt into the general population, making 
it near impossible to distinguish friend from foe. Reacting to Monday's 
shooting, Major General Buford Blount, commander of Third Infantry 
Division, said Tuesday his troops were "very concerned about it and 
very sorry that it happened." But he stressed that with US soldiers 
on edge after the suicide car bomb attack, the unit that opened fire 
on the minibus had respected its rules of engagement. A written statement 
issued by US Central Command here early Tuesday said initial reports 
of the checkpoint shooting "indicate the soldiers responded in accordance 
with the rules of engagement to protect themselves". "In light of 
recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers exercised 
considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of life." Central 
Command spokesman James Wilkinson later described the shooting as 
an "unfortunate tragedy" and acknowledged that young US soldiers could 
well be "a little jumpy" in the aftermath of the suicide bombing. 
"While it is a tragedy and we certainly grieve for the loss of the 
innocent," he told a BBC interviewer, "it does point out the tactics 
that this regime is going to use. "In instances like this, the fault 
lies with the regime." US Brigadier General Vincent Brooks told a 
press briefing Tuesday at Central Command's forward planning base 
in Qatar, "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they remain 
unavoidable as they have been throughout history." "Our efforts may 
result in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result 
in the loss of Iraqi military lives," he also said when asked if the 
checkpoint shooting would affect the coalition's efforts to win "the 
hearts and minds" of the people of Iraq. As civilian casualties mount 
in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day and night 
air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was a further blow to a US public 
relations campaign that seeks to portray coalition troops as liberators 
and providers rather than invaders and occupiers. US newspapers warned 
of the negative fallout from the killings on public opinion in Iraq 
as well as the Middle East at large, and said such incidents play 
into the hands of President Saddam Hussein's regime. The balancing 
act for military commanders to minimize civilian casualties while 
putting down Iraqi resistance is "clearly growing harder," the Washington 
Post said. "Even if accidental, such events, like the deaths of civilians 
in Baghdad attributed to errant US bombs, can incur large political 
costs both in and outside Iraq," the Post said. The New York Times 
said that "billions around the globe are seeing and hearing reports 
that women and children were gunned down yesterday ... "This is just 
what the Iraqi commanders have in mind when they send soldiers disguised 
as non-combatants to fire on unsuspecting American troops," the paper 
said. "If such scenes become routine ... , the political war for Iraq 
could be lost even before the military one is won," warned the Times. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), meanwhile, said 
it regretted the shooting and hoped US troops made sure that the driver 
of the minibus, had been adequately warned. "We hope that they took 
all the necessary measures to warn the people, to clearly alert them," 
Antonella Notari, an ICRC spokeswoman in Geneva, told reporters. "Checkpoints 
have, of course, the right to try and defend their own security and 
the security of their personnel so they may search vans, they may 
stop vehicles, there are certain rules on how you proceed in that," 
she said. "I can't comment on what exactly happened on the spot, I 
can only deeply regret that again they were civilians who were hit," 
she added. nh-lc/bur/hc/mb Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

ROME, April 1 (AFP) - AC Milan's veteran Brazilian midfielder Leonardo 
said Tuesday he is retiring from football early so that he concentrate 
on his duties as the Italian club's assistant vice-president. The 
33-year-old, who played in the 1998 World Cup final defeat by France, 
returned to Milan last October having left them in the summer of 2001 
to play back home in Brazil. Originally he said he was going to quit 
at the end of the current season when his player contract expires, 
but has decided to hang up his boots now so he can focus on boardroom 
duties. "I have chosen to stop my football career before the end of 
the season because I have so many things to look after apart from 
playing that it becomes impossible to combine training with all my 
other engagements," he said. "I am looking forward to working for 
the club which has shown great respect and love towards me." Leonardo 
last played for Milan on December 22 against Brescia. sb/ak Fbl-BRA-ITA-Leonardo

The Iraqi military has brought up reinforcements to bolster depleted 
Republican Guard units south of Baghdad ahead of a major push on the 
capital by US-British forces, US officers said Tuesday. They said 
mixed and matched elements of five Republican Guard divisions, elite 
troops backed by heavy armor, manned a southern arc in front of the 
capital bracing for a decisive drive to oust President Saddam Hussein. 
There was no immediate estimate how many troops this would represent 
but it could run into the tens of thousands. Iraqi divisions normally 
comprise 12,000-15,000 troops. The US army's 20,000-strong 3rd Infantry 
Division, supported by the 101st Airborne Division and its Apache 
attack helicopters, is south of Baghdad, geared for an attack with 
two formations of US marines to its east. Major John Altman, intelligence 
officer for the 3rd Infantry Division's First Brigade, said the Iraqis 
were reinforcing the Republican Guard after days of punishing air 
strikes and probing ground attacks by US-led forces. "What's happening 
is that you reinforce the unit you expect to be in contact and you 
fill a unit that is attrited," Altman told AFP near Najaf, about 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad. He said the Republican Guard's 
armored Medina Division had been heavily battered by days of air strikes, 
artillery attacks and assaults by the tank-busting Apaches. The Iraqis 
brought down from north of Baghdad elements of the armored Hammurabi 
and mechanized Nebuchadnezzar divisions, Altman said. Troops of the 
Al Nida armored and Adnan divisions were also in place south of the 
capital. The intelligence officer said that fighting had been heavy 
around a bridge that crosses the Euphrates River southwest of the 
Shiite Muslim city of Karbala 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Baghdad. 
"We made great headway," Altman said. "We can easily own the ground 
there and use the bridge." lc/pm/mb Iraq-war-battle-troops

The appeals court in Ndjamena on Tuesday freed two Chadian journalists 
who were jailed in February for libelling a top civil servant. The 
managing editor of the independent weekly Notre Temps, Nadji Kimo, 
and a senior staffer on the paper, Mbainaye Betoubam, were freed conditionally, 
pending the hearing of their case on April 22. The two had been sentenced 
in early February to six months in prison and had their newspaper 
shut down for three months, after an article in Notre Temps accused 
the director of social affairs in the ministry of social action and 
women, Billy Douga, of avenging the theft of some jewellery by torturing 
the alleged thieves. One of the suspects allegedly died of his wounds. 
Police, who arrested three people in connection with the theft, said 
that the man allegedly tortured to death had died in Ndjamena of an 
incurable disease, without ever having been detained. The arrest of 
the two newsmen sparked a protest from the Central African Media Organisation 
(OMAC) and the Union of Press Editors of Central Africa (UEPAC), which 
said it was "a serious blow to press freedom". "UEPAC and OMAC denounce 
and condemn with their utmost vigour this verdict from another age," 
the two organisations said then in a joint statement released to AFP. 
The suspension of Notre Temps was a "serious setback to the economic 
survival of the company and a noteworthy step backwards in the democratic 
process in Chad," added the statement. aak/mcl/kdz/nb Chad-media-justice

Saddam palace battered in Baghdad blitz, civilian death toll climbs 
by Nayla Razzouk and Jacques Charmelot = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - 
ADDS latest tolls, new raids /// BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - President 
Saddam Hussein's biggest palace took a fresh hit Tuesday, as the battering 
of Baghdad intensifies and the civilian death toll rises ever higher 
with US-led forces pummeling the defiant Iraqi regime. Heavy bombing 
boomed out from the city's southern rim and the ack-ack of anti-aircraft 
batteries could be heard sporadically on the 13th day of the war. 
Information Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf said that 18 more people 
had been killed and more than 100 wounded in strikes on Baghdad since 
Monday evening. Five of them died and 25 were wounded in Tuesday morning's 
raids. He added that more than 30 other Iraqis were killed and more 
than 130 others wounded in various other parts of Iraq, including 
the provinces of Qadissiyah, Babylon and Salahaddin. An AFP reporter 
saw a missile or smart bomb explode in the heart of the Republican 
Palace complex around 09:00 (0600 GMT) after a dozen missiles crashed 
into the Iraqi capital overnight. A huge plume of smoke rose into 
the air over the sprawling palace grounds, a potent symbol of Saddam's 
grip on power which has been a frequent target of the bombardments. 
At US Central Command in Qatar, a military spokesman admitted that 
US troops, fearful of a fresh suicide attack, opened fire on a civilian 
vehicle killing seven women and children. The shooting occurred at 
a checkpoint manned by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry 
Division at Najaf, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on 
Monday afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. The 
admission came after villagers on the edge of the capital reported 
20 more civilians dead, 11 of them children, from the blitz. Sahhaf 
also said several people were wounded when a US warplane attacked 
two Iraqi buses carrying international volunteers, some of them American, 
who were operating as "human shields". He said the attack took place 
Monday in the western town of Rutba on the road from Baghdad to Jordan. 
Intense bombardments also resumed Tuesday after a night of relative 
calm on the outskirts of the city, where four divisions of Saddam's 
elite Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any 
ground attack. AFP reporters said the raids were getting worse after 
Monday saw the heaviest bombardment since the war began on March 20. 
Overnight, the ominous whistle of the missiles was heard in the sky 
before a series of explosions shook the city, appearing to knock out 
electricity in entire neighbourhoods. Balls of smoke slowly merged 
into a single cloud overhead. Official sites of the regime were targeted. 
Two missiles were seen smashing into the Republican Palace compound 
along the banks of the Tigris River, which had already been pounded 
earlier in the day. The eerie silence in the aftermath of the raid 
was broken only by the wail of ambulance sirens, their flashing red 
lights criss-crossing the main avenue along the river. US Central 
Command said coalition forces had targeted Monday night an office 
complex serving regime leaders and housing Iraq's National Olympic 
Committee and the Ministry of Youth. "The strike was executed to erode 
the command and control capabilities of regime leaders," it said, 
adding that battle assessment was ongoing. Coalition forces say thousands 
of attack sorties have been carried out since the war began with 1,000 
on Sunday alone. The information ministry was hit earlier Monday, 
and domestic television was knocked out for several hours. Meanwhile, 
an AFP journalist was accompanied to Janabiyah village on the southeastern 
edge of Baghdad, where residents said 11 children were among 20 people 
killed when missiles hit five sleeping families on a farm Saturday 
night. The victims had already been buried according to Muslim tradition 
but the stench of death still hung over the farm. One building had 
been flattened, and the carcasses of dead animals were black with 
swarms of flies. Schoolbooks soaked in blood testified to the carnage. 
The United States and Britain say the war will not be finished until 
Saddam's 24-year grip on power is ended. However state television 
underscored Saddam was still in control of the country. It showed 
him chairing a meeting of top aides including Uday, his elder son, 
who was being shown on television for the first time since the war 
began. It said the footage had been recorded Monday. Uday heads the 
Saddam's Fedayeen militia, intensely loyal fighters who have joined 
regular Iraqi forces in mounting fierce resistance to US and British 
ground troops in the south aiming to push their way to Baghdad. An 
Iraqi military spokesman said Monday at least 54 US and British soldiers 
had been killed in the previous 24 hours, most in the south of the 
country. bur/bp/lp/hc Iraq-war-Baghdad

Vandals have defaced one of the biggest British war cemeteries in 
northern France with graffiti condemning the US-British invasion of 
Iraq, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said Monday. Insults 
aimed at British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George 
W. Bush were sprayed in red paint over a monument to Britain's dead 
from World War I and discovered by a gardener last Thursday. "It was 
removed by the afternoon but not before a couple of coach loads (of 
visitors) had been through and seen it. We are pretty hacked off and 
I am pleased to say the French authorities are too," said Tim Reeves, 
the CWGC's representative in France. The words "Rosbifs (British) 
go home! Saddam Hussein will win and spill your blood" were painted 
in French over the base of the cemetery's main monument -- an obelisk 
topped by a cross. On one side was a swastika and the words "Death 
to the yankees." Some 11,000 British dead are buried at Etaples, which 
lies on the Channel coast around 15 miles (24 kilometres) south of 
Boulogne. It was the site of several hospitals during the 1914-1918 
war. A judicial enquiry has been opened. "This violation of a burial 
place -- scandalous in itself -- is an attack on the memory of the 
sacrifice made by the British and American soldiers who contributed 
to the liberation of our soil," said the local member of parliament, 
former Socialist arts minister Jack Lang. "Our disagreement with the 
British and American governments (on Iraq) can in no way justify any 
assault on the memory of men who sacrificed themselves for our country," 
he said. hs/yad Iraq-war-France-Britain

Britain Prime Minister Tony Blair said he "genuinely believes" the 
US-led war against Iraq will be "a blessing for all the Iraqi people," 
in an article for the Jordan Times published Tuesday. He said the 
decision to forcefully disarm Iraq's President Saddam Hussein of his 
alleged weapons of mass destruction was "the right choice," stressing 
it is not "a war of conquest but of liberation." He said the coalition 
was "doing all that is humanly possible to minimize civilian casualties 
and finish this campaign quickly," adding that Britain "was working 
hard to bring immediate humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people," and 
would later assist in the country's reconstruction. Brushing off anti-war 
groups' criticism that the coalition's decision to go to war was mainly 
motivated by Iraqi oil, Blair wrote that he, US President George W. 
Bush and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar "have pledged Iraq's oil 
will be placed in a UN trust fund to benefit the people of Iraq." 
"We will work towards lifting UN sanctions as soon as Iraq meets its 
obligations," he said in reference to the embargo on Saddam's regime 
in force since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. "British military 
forces will withdraw from Iraq as soon as practicable. We hope to 
see the early establishment of a transitional civilian administration," 
Blair also wrote without further elaborating. He expressed hope that 
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process would be positively affected 
by the war in Iraq. And he reiterated his commitment "to a fair, lasting 
and negotiated settlement by 2005 to provide a viable state of the 
Palestinian people and security for Israel." sc/mb Iraq-war-Britain-Blair-Jordan

The British government admitted for the first time Iraqi civilians 
may see US-British forces as villains not liberators, only hours before 
reports early Tuesday that American troops had fired on a civilian 
vehicles killing seven women and children. "We know that for the moment 
we will be seen as the villains. We knew that from the reaction before 
the conflict started," Home Secretary David Blunkett told BBC television. 
He was speaking late Monday shortly before reports that US troops 
had shot dead seven women and children after firing on a civilian 
vehicle at a military checkpoint in central Iraq. The incident was 
thought likely to fuel vocal international opposition to the 13-day-old 
war and undermine US efforts to win support from the Iraqi people. 
But Britain's secretary of state for the armed forces Adam Ingram 
told Sky News the civilian shooting was "a tragedy that happened due 
to the heat of war." US media Tuesday also warned of the negative 
impact that incidents like the checkpoint shooting will have on public 
opinion in Iraq and the Middle East, with the New York Times saying 
it is just what the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants. 
Analysts have said US military planners erred in calculating that 
the Iraqi population would greet the invaders as liberators, with 
US and British troops instead facing dogged resistance. Blunkett, 
however, took the long view, saying once the war is over "and there 
is a free Iraq ... the population as a whole will say that we want 
a free country, we want a state to live in where we can use our talent 
to the full rather (than) as with the Iraqi regime they have been 
dependent, 60 percent dependent, on food for oil." "What we want from 
the region is an answer to the question not only whose side are you 
on ... but what sort of society in the future do you want to see," 
he said. "Do you want to see functioning states that allow their people 
to flourish, to produce, to provide scientific endeavour, to feed 
their own people, do you want states that are actually free enough 
to be able to speak their minds rather than seek asylum in our country?" 
"If that is what you want, if you want a free enterprising region 
where people can speak and act freely, then you are on our side not 
on theirs," Blunkett said. Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said 
Tuesday that it has become apparent "that obviously after two-and-a-half 
decades of (Iraqi President) Saddam (Hussein), fear has been a major 
factor in the response of the local population. "But where the local 
population in those areas we control have begun to see we are serious 
and are going to stay, the fear factor is receding day by day," he 
said. Officers in southern Iraq said Tuesday that British forces in 
the region were swapping their helmets for berets as markets and schools 
reopened in secure areas. They said the berets were a symbolic gesture 
to the local people. "You can see the guys' faces, so it indicates 
openness and friendliness," according to a British spokeswoman. British 
forces spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon admitted in a BBC Radio 4 Today 
program that incidents like the checkpoint shooting undermined efforts 
to win the support of the Iraqi people. "If you were a civilian watching 
that, of course you would interpret it in that way," he said. But 
he said junior officers had the "full backing" of their superiors 
to make snap decisions about a situation "whichever way it goes". 
"If the decision is made that the threat against our soldiers is sufficient, 
that they have to use self defence, then they will be fully supported. 
"They will be backed fully whichever way it goes," Vernon said. US 
officials have said the victims of the checkpoint shooting were in 
a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at the military post despite 
repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle 
escaped unharmed. msa/heg/yad/jkb Iraq-war-Britain-perception

The Council of Europe Secretary General Walter Schwimmer Tuesday praised 
the Qatari television station Al-Jazeera and said its freedom of expression 
should be respected. Al-Jazeera "is an independent channel which makes 
use of its freedom of expression. The freedom of expression and independence 
of al-Jazeera must be respected by players in the international community," 
he said. Schwimmer criticised a decision taken by the New York Stock 
Exchange last week to suspend the accreditation of two journalists 
with the Qatari channel. An official confirmed on condition of anonymity 
that the decision was made because of the war against Iraq. US officials 
have criticised the television station -- increasingly popular in 
the Middle East -- for representing a one-sided version of the Iraqi 
war and for broadcasting pictures of coalition dead and prisoners 
of war. The Council of Europe was set up after World War II to promote 
democracy and human rights and now comprises 44 member nations. bur/hs/yad

A leading ally of a Nigerian state governor was shot dead after returning 
from a day's campaigning, a state official said Tuesday, the latest 
in a series of murders in the run-up to key general elections. Gbenga 
Ogunremi, spokesman for Governor Adeniyi Adebayo of the southwestern 
state of Ekiti, said that businessman Yemi Oni was shot dead in his 
home late on Saturday by unidentified gunmen. "On Saturday he went 
for a rally in his home town with the governor," he said. "Afterwards 
he visited some friends before returning home. Fifteen minutes later 
they came in and shot him." No-one else was hurt in the attack and 
nothing was stolen from the house, he said. "I've just met with the 
police, they are still investigating," he added. "Yemi Oni was not 
really a politician, he was more of a businessman and a friend of 
the governor," he said. Nigeria's first elections since the end of 
military rule four years ago are due to begin on April 12 with legislative 
elections. Presidential and state gubernatorial polls are to be held 
a week later. As campaigning heats up a wave of political violence 
has gripped the country, with ethnic unrest in the Niger Delta hitting 
oil exports and the murders of a series of leading politicians. Ogunremi 
said that Ekiti, where Adebayo is campaigning for re-election under 
the banner of the opposition party Alliance for Democracy (AD), has 
so far been spared the worst of the trouble, except for one other 
attack. "In December last year there was a women's leader of the AD 
who was splashed with acid. She died a few weeks ago and by coincidence 
will be buried on Saturday on the same day as Oni," he said. More 
than 10,000 Nigerians have been killed in mob violence since President 
Olusegun Obasanjo's 1999 election heralded the end of 15 years of 
increasingly brutal military rule. That poll was organised and tightly 
controlled by the the military regime and this month's elections have 
been billed as the first key test for the young democracy in Africa's 
most populous country. Already observers have raised fears that the 
violence and instability in the country could prevent many voters 
from getting to the polls. dc/nb Nigeria-vote-unrest-killing

Some 20 young Russians stripped off naked in a smart Moscow shopping 
street Tuesday to win a free mobile phone in a promotion to mark the 
first day of spring. The Euroset chain had posted a large sign outside 
its shop-window promising: "Anyone who comes naked between 9.50 am 
and 10.15 am will get a Motorola phone." Hoardes of people descended 
on the store, located a stone's throw from the Kremlin, from seven 
in the morning, hoping it was their lucky day. "A crowd of curious 
onlookers and girls and young men hungry for freebies created chaos 
outside our shop, glued to the windows and trying to force their way 
through the closed doors," spokeswoman Tatyana Gulyaeva said. But 
with the number of free handsets restricted, only the first 20 visitors 
willing to bare their bodies for the photographers' flashlights got 
their prized possession. "When we opened, the 20 telephones were snatched 
up in 15 minutes. There turned out to be more volunteers than phones. 
Happy spring!" said Gulyaeva. via/hm/jkb Russia-offbeat

Iraq brought up reinforcements for Republican Guard units defending 
the approaches to Baghdad, US officers said Tuesday, as US forces 
pressed their operations ahead of an expected major push on the capital. 
The US army's elite 101st Airborne Division stepped up its campaign 
around the city of Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) from Baghdad, 
flying in Apache and Kiowa attack helicopters to support infantry 
troops, officers said. US commanders have said their troops were within 
100 kilometers (60 miles) of the capital in their drive to remove 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Some have signaled a major tank battle 
could be shaping up in the next week. The US army's 20,000-strong 
3rd Infantry Division, supported by the 101st Airborne, was south 
of Baghdad and geared for an attack. Two formations of US marines 
were to its east. Officers said mixed and matched elements of five 
Republican Guard divisions, elite troops backed by heavy armor, manned 
a southern arc in front of Baghdad, bracing for a decisive drive in 
the nearly two-week-old campaign. There was no immediate estimate 
how many troops this would represent but it could run into the tens 
of thousands. Iraqi divisions normally comprise 12,000-15,000 troops. 
Major John Altman, intelligence officer for the 3rd Infantry Division's 
First Brigade, said the Iraqis were reinforcing the Republican Guard 
after days of punishing air strikes and probing ground attacks by 
US-led forces. "What's happening is that you reinforce the unit you 
expect to be in contact and you fill a unit that is attrited," Altman 
told AFP near Najaf, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad. 
He said the Republican Guard's armored Medina Division had been heavily 
battered by days of air strikes, artillery attacks and assaults by 
the tank-busting Apaches. The Iraqis brought down from north of Baghdad 
elements of the armored Hammurabi and mechanized Nebuchadnazzar divisions, 
Altman said. Troops of the Al-Nida armored and Adnan divisions were 
also in place south of the capital. "Elements of five Republican Guard 
divisions are oriented along the southeast and southwest of Baghdad," 
Altman said. The intelligence officer said that fighting had been 
heavy around a key bridge that crosses the Euphrates River southwest 
of the Shiite Muslim city of Karbala, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from 
Baghdad. "We made great headway," Altman said. "We can easily own 
the ground there and use the bridge." Colonel Greg Gass, the 101st's 
aviation brigade commander, described the fighting Monday as the heaviest 
his forces had been involved in since the start of the war on March 
20. "They fought pretty hard from first light (into the afternoon)," 
Gass said of the Iraqis, adding eight Apaches sustained hits "from 
just a hole in the rotor to significant tail damage." US officials 
also said the Army 3rd Infantry Division attacked Iraqi positions 
Monday in quarries below Karbala, which like Najaf is a Shiite holy 
city. They said elements of the 3rd Infantry Division also hit out 
northward at what they called pockets of Iraqi resistance in the area. 
Two air defense artillery systems, two armored personnel carriers, 
one artillery piece and nine technical vehicles were destroyed, they 
said. Several Iraqis were killed and about 30 taken prisoner. US-British 
forces kept up their bombardment of Baghdad Tuesday, hitting the main 
presidential palace complex for the second consecutive day. Iraqi 
officials said 18 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded 
in British and US air strikes on the capital since Monday evening. 
But the Americans also took another public relations hit Tuesday when 
troops fearful of a fresh suicide attack opened fire on a civilian 
vehicle at a military checkpoint at Najaf, killing seven women and 
children. The incident occurred three days after a suicide bombing 
killed four US soldiers and left other troops jittery. Officials said 
the victims Tuesday were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite 
warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the minibus escaped 
unharmed. US marines were busy securing supply routes and mopping 
up areas of southern Iraq. Officials said they seized Sunday a huge 
ammunition supply depot with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars 
and other weapons. British forces in southern Iraq swapped their helmets 
for berets as markets and schools reopened, but the battle for the 
key regional port of Basra still lie ahead. The British units besieging 
Basra said they were waiting for more manpower before trying to take 
the southern metropolis. They kept up their siege after taking the 
neighboring town of Abu al-Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Tuesday it was "increasingly 
probable" that Iraq was behind the attack on a civilian target in 
Baghdad last month. "It's increasingly probable that this was the 
result of Iraqi, not coalition action," Straw said in a speech to 
newspaper editors in London. He was apparently referring to an attack 
on March 26 in Baghdad in which 14 civilians were killed and around 
30 wounded as two missiles fell in a working-class market district. 
British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon has said the attack may have 
been caused by the Iraqi military. "Although investigations continue 
into this tragic incident, it could clearly have been caused by fallout 
from the regime's anti-aircraft fire or the failure of one of the 
regime's own missiles," Hoon said. Baghdad has said allied fire was 
responsible. The United States acknowledged it might have killed some 
civilians with air strikes. A statement by the US Central Command 
said coalition warplanes used precision-guided weapons to attack nine 
Iraqi surface-to-surface missiles and launchers that were placed in 
a residential neighborhood of Baghdad. "Most of the missiles were 
positioned less than 300 feet (90 meters) from homes," said the statement. 
It made no direct mention of deaths in the text, but the headline 
read: "Civilian damage possible." msa/heg/yad Iraqi-war-Britain-bombing-Straw

Some 20 young Russians stripped off naked in a shop on a smart Moscow 
shopping street Tuesday to win a free mobile phone in a promotion 
to mark the first day of spring. The Euroset chain had posted a large 
sign outside its shop-window promising: "Anyone who comes naked between 
9.50 am and 10.15 am will get a Motorola phone." Hoardes of people 
descended on the store, located a stone's throw from the Kremlin, 
from seven in the morning, hoping it was their lucky day. "A crowd 
of curious onlookers and girls and young men hungry for freebies created 
chaos outside our shop, glued to the windows and trying to force their 
way through the closed doors," spokeswoman Tatyana Gulyaeva said. 
But with the number of free handsets restricted, only the first 20 
visitors willing to bare their bodies for the photographers' flashlights 
got their prized possession. "When we opened, the 20 telephones were 
snatched up in 15 minutes. There turned out to be more volunteers 
than phones. Happy spring!" said Gulyaeva. via/hm/jkb Russia-offbeat

Singapore on Tuesday reported another three new cases of the killer 
respiratory virus including a sixth imported infection, raising the 
city-state's reported cases to 95. The latest Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) index case involved a 56-year-old Chinese national 
who arrived from China's Fujian province near Guangdong on March 16 
to visit her daughter, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. 
"She became unwell on March 28 and was admitted to TTSH (Tan Tong 
Seng Hospital) as a suspect SARS case on March 29," the statement 
said. The woman was "diagnosed as a SARS case," it said, adding home 
quarantine orders are being issued. Four people in Singapore have 
died from SARS in Singapore out of the 95 cases reported so far. The 
city-state is among the worst hit in Asia and authorities have taken 
tough measures to contain the spread of the virus by closing schools 
up to the pre-universty level until April 6 and serving mandatory 
quarantine orders. Of the 95 cases, 13 of them are still in serious 
condition, the ministry said. There is no known cure for SARS which 
has now killed more than 60 people and infected over 1,900 globally.

Nigeria's main labour movement said Tuesday that two weeks before 
the start of key national elections it had reached an agreement with 
government to halt a threatened public sector pay strike. A three-day 
warning strike was to have begun on Tuesday, but an overnight meeting 
with government officials led to its suspension until after polling 
day, labour and government officials said. But the last minute decision 
to call off the action did not filter down to all government employees, 
AFP found, and some staff in federal offices in Lagos failed to turn 
up to work. Nigeria has been gripped by fuel shortages and a rising 
tide of ethnic and political violence in the run up to the elections, 
and the Nigeria Labour Congress's (NLC) decision will come as a relief 
to government. The news will also be welcomed on the world oil markets, 
which are already nervously eyeing ethnic unrest in the south of the 
country which has seen Nigeria's crude exports slashed by 40 percent. 
"We held a fruitful meeting with President Olusegun Obasanjo ... and 
the labour minister, and we agreed to suspend the strike pending the 
resolution of the dispute," NLC spokesman Owei Lakemfa told AFP. "The 
government has agreed to set up an implementation committee on the 
issue of the 12.5 percent pay rise for workers. We believe they will 
honour the agreement this time," he added. The deal would directly 
affect Nigeria's legions of federal government workers, including 
those in state oil production, telecoms and power firms, but will 
also be seen as a benchmark for state governments and the private 
sector. A statement released by the presidency signed by President 
Olusegun Obasanjo and NLC president Adams Oshiomhole confirmed that 
an interim agreement had been reached. "At the instance of the federal 
government, the leadership of the NLC met leadership of the federal 
government to deliberate on the issue of a 12.5 percent salary increase 
for workers," it said. "It was agreed that both sides shall work out 
the modalities for implementing the salary increase as it affects 
all grade levels. A joint committee to work out this has already been 
set up," it said. It said a supplementary budget on the pay hike will 
be sent to parliament for approval, and called on workers to show 
patience. But at the Federal Office of Statistics in Lagos a security 
guard turned an AFP reporter back at the gate. "You cannot find anybody. 
Aren't you are aware that we are on strike?" he said. He said the 
decision to stage the walkout passed to them by officials of the Trade 
Union Congress, a sister union of the NLC. On March 12, the NLC had 
threatened to call an indefinite national strike from April 1 because 
of the government's failure to honour a pay agreement, but by Sunday 
it was scaling back its threat. "We have limited the strike to three 
days in order to ensure that the forthcoming elections are conducted 
peacefully," Oshiomhole told reporters. Lakemfa said Tuesday that 
the impending poll had influenced the union's decision. "We do not 
want to heat up the system ahead of the general and presidential polls 
in April," he said. "There are lots of bad things going on such as 
political assassinations, long queues for petrol, that it will be 
unreasonable to add to the sufferings of the masses." Nigeria is to 
hold legislative, governorship and presidential elections this month, 
in the first test of the troubled west African nation's experiment 
with democracy since the 1999 return of civilian rule. A series of 
assassinations, riots and protests has raised fears that -- in a country 
which has seen more than 10,000 people killed in less than four years 
-- the polls could be marred by violence. In the Niger Delta region 
of the south, a violent uprising by ethnic Ijaw militants has forced 
oil multinationals to evacuate facilities producing more than 800,000 
barrels per day, more than a third of normal output. joa-ola/nb Nigeria-social-strike

After marathon struggle, warring DR Congo sides agree on peace govt 
by Jean-Jacques Cornish = (PICTURES) = ATTENTION - ADDS quotes, details 
/// SUN CITY, South Africa, April 1 (AFP) - All sides in talks aimed 
at restoring peace in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Tuesday 
wrapped up 29 months of intense negotiations, agreeing to shape a 
government to lead to the first democratic elections in the former 
Zaire in 40 years. The approximately 360 delegates attending the final 
session of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (ICD), which began 14 months 
ago, went into the talks' final plenary session on Tuesday morning. 
Within ten minutes they had adopted agreements reached in Pretoria 
on December 17 last year, that provide for a two-year transition government 
to take the DRC through to democratic elections -- the first since 
those on independence from Belgium in 1960. They also adopted a constitution, 
which was agreed on March 6. "You are making history," the chairman 
of the talks, Sir Ketumile Masire, told delegates at the luxury South 
African casino resort of Sun City, some 150 kilometres (90 miles) 
northwest of Pretoria. "I would like to thank and congratulate you 
for the work you have done in South Africa," the former Botswanan 
president told the ICD, which he has chaired since the talks first 
moved to South Africa in February 2002. The resolutions agreed Tuesday 
will, together with 34 other resolutions adopted during the previous 
session of the ICD at Sun City last year, constitute the so-called 
Final Act in the DRC peace process, to be signed on Wednesday in the 
presence some 10 African leaders. South African President Thabo Mbeki 
has invited no fewer than nine African heads of state to witness the 
proceedings. It remained unclear whether President Joseph Kabila, 
who has insisted that the climax of the peace process take place in 
Kinshasa, will attend Wednesday's signing ceremony. His ambassador 
to South Africa, Bene M'Poko told AFP: "He doesn't need to come. We 
will have our celebrations back home." Sources close to the mediation 
insisted however that Kabila was being urged to make an appearance 
on Wednesday. "It would be a serious miscalculation for him not to 
come," said a source who asked not to be named. "The delegates are 
saying: 'We have made him our president and he will not even see the 
process through'. It would be a disaster if he does not arrive." Senegalese 
politician Moustapha Niasse, who was appointed as the UN special envoy 
to the DRC talks after the dialogue appeared to founder last year, 
told AFP he was not at all surprised at the speed and smoothness of 
Tuesday's proceedings. "We did our job," said Niasse, who presided 
over the December and March agreements in Pretoria with South African 
Provincial Affairs Minister Sydney Mufamadi. "After they had all signed 
those agreements, they could not contest anything contained in them. 
"All that remains now is a matter that cannot be resolved by the mediation," 
said Niasse referring to the military agreement struck in Pretoria 
last week but which so far had been signed only by the rebel Congolese 
Rally for Democracy (RCD). Added Niasse: "The Congolese have to start 
doing something for themselves. The main problem in that (military) 
agreement is deciding who should become head of the army, which comprises 
98 percent of the military." The five other belligerents have contested 
the attribution of the post of army chief to the RCD, which already 
has the ministry of defence in the transitional government. "The Congolese 
must talk on their own and solve this problem themselves," said Niasse. 
"The mediation cannot deal with it." Preparing for Wednesday's closing 
ceremony, delegates from the unarmed opposition and civil society 
still have to decide on their candidates for the vice presidency and 
the follow-up committee that will run the DRC until the transitional 
government comes into force, between two weeks and two months from 
Thursday. War broke out in DRC in 1998, and has since then killed 
some 2.5 million people, either directly through the fighting or indirectly 
through famine and illness, according to United Nations estimates

Iraqi forces prevented British forces from landing near the strategic 
city of Mosul in northern Iraq, and killed many of the troops, Information 
Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahhaf said here Tuesday. "The British force 
which had been dropped there has been eliminated mostly. Only a few 
managed to flee by helicopter," Sahhaf said in his daily briefing 
to reporters on the war. The minister also said 18 people were killed 
and more than 100 wounded in British and US air strikes on Baghdad 
since Monday evening, but painted a very different picture from US 
officials on battles raging in the south. He said the British landing 
took place in the Baaj district west of Mosul. He did not say when 
it happened, and there has been no confirmation from British sources. 
Mosul, some 450 kilometres (280 miles) north of Baghdad, has been 
the target of repeated coalition air strikes as Britain and the United 
States attempt to soften its defences ahead of the long-awaited opening 
of a second front in the north. He said the Iraqi fighters, included 
the paramilitary Saddam's Fedayeen militia, which attacked the British 
landing captured "most of their equipment, their weapons, their armoured 
cars and vehicles." "It is a complete defeat for the first military 
drop in the north. And amazingly, the Americans had pushed the British 
to do that, as if it was an experiment to be implemented on the British 
to see what are the results. "The results were very tragic for the 
British," he said, without saying exactly how many British soldiers 
were killed. The Arabic satellite news channel Al-Jazeera for its 
part reported the landing took place overnight Sunday. On Tuesday, 
it broadcast images of locals parading weapons and ammunition, as 
well as military vehicles, apparently belonging to British forces. 
Some 1,000 troops from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade have parachuted 
into Kurdish-held territory in the northern Iraq, while another 1,000 
special forces have been deployed in the region. Sahhaf also said 
that "fierce battles" had taekn place between British troops and Iraqi 
forces in the southern town of Abu al-Khasib, near the country's second 
city of Basra. "They inflicted high casualties on the British troops 
there and the corpses of the enemy are still there on the battleground," 
he said. However, reports from the scene said the last Iraqi resistance 
had been wiped out in Abu al-Khasib and that the British troops were 
being welcomed by some residents. The British attacked outlying areas 
of Basra on Monday but were awaiting reinforcements before any drive 
into the town centre, which has been defended by paramilitary forces 
fiercely loyal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The minster also 
said that Iraqi forces had downed a US helicopter on the outskirts 
of Basra. US troops were "confronted by a mechanized Iraqi unit, then 
the American column retreated. Then the Iraqi side shot down one helicopter," 
he said. He said there was more heavy fighting in the southern city 
of Nasiriyah. "In Nasiriyah, again a very fierce battle is taking 
place up until this moment when I'm talking to you. (US forces) have 
approached the city again, they are thrusting toward the city, and 
fierce battles are taking place," he said. ma/dab/mb Iraq-war-US-Britain-Mosul

The war in Iraq has caused an unexpectedly steep slump in the number 
of passengers travelling with state-owned Turkish Airlines (THY), 
the new company president Abdurrahman Gundogdu said on Tuesday. "The 
fall is bigger than we had expected," he told the Anatolia news agency, 
while denying press reports that the number of passengers had fallen 
by half. "It is not around 50 percent, I don't have the exact figures," 
he said. But Gundogdu said that the airline had increased the number 
of flights to China, from three to five flights a week. The airline 
has had to suspend some domestic and international flights because 
of the war in Iraq. Several towns in southeastern Turkey are no longer 
served. On March 21, Turkey, which shares a border with Iraq, opened 
its air space to US and British military aircraft involved in the 
war. A suspension of THY flights to Bahrain and Kuwait, planned until 
April 10, has been extended until April 30. ba/hd/vs Iraq-war-Turkey-air-company-TurkishAirlines

Four Russian soldiers were killed and another wounded when a landmine 
exploded in the southern republic of Ingushetia, bordering war-torn 
Chechnya, on Tuesday, the defence ministry said. "A mine was found 
near the village of Ali-Yurt during an inspection mission prior to 
the passage of a military convoy. The mine exploded as the sappers 
were approaching," spokesman Nikolai Deryabin said, as quoted by the 
Interfax news agency. "As a result of this terrorist act, four soldiers 
were killed and another was wounded," he said. Russian officials routinely 
describe actions by Chechen separatists, whom they have been fighting 
since Moscow sent troops into the republic in October 1999, as "terrorists."

Swedes, who flock south en masse each winter in search of sunnier 
climes, were taken for a ride on Tuesday when a leading daily ran 
an April Fool's story saying that that their bracing capital Stockholm 
was to get a city-centre beach, complete with desert sand from the 
Gulf state of Dubai. The newspaper Dagens Nyheter said Stockholm city 
officials had asked construction group Skanska to transform a portion 
of the waterfront at the foot of the Royal Palace into a sandy beach 
in time for summer. The report sounded like music to the ears of sun-craving 
northerners who live in near-darkness for almost eight months of the 
year and dream of holidays consisting of white sand, beach totes and 
a roaring surf. Dagens Nyheter said the idea was based on the success 
of a similar project in Paris called "Paris Plage". However, contrary 
to the polluted waters of the Seine, beach-goers in the Swedish capital 
would be able to take a dip in the clean ,if rather frosty, waters 
of the Baltic Sea. It said the beach would most likely be called Playa 
Royal. "The beach will be 150 metres (500 feet) long, which corresponds 
to the length required by the European Union for a beach to be called 
Playa," it said, taking a swipe at EU bureaucracy. No expense would 
be spared in making Swedes' biggest wish come true, the paper said, 
noting that city officials had insisted that the sandy beach match 
the colour scheme of the Royal Palace. "We have searched the world 
over to find the right quality and colour, and now we think we have 
found it. We are soon going to sign a contract with a sand supplier 
from the Dubai desert," Skanska director Mats Williamson was quoted 
as saying. Skanska later issued a press release dashing the hopes 
of any Swedes who may have believed the story. liu/po/jh/ds Sweden-offbeat-AprilFool

Many analysts predict a protracted bloodbath when coalition forces 
finally take on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's most loyal fighters 
in the streets of Baghdad. But in the country's second city of Basra, 
British troops are slowly claiming success in their bid to root out 
Saddam's forces while sparing themselves and local civilians a savage 
street-fight. The battle for Basra, a port and vital gateway for humanitarian 
supplies, provides an insight into how the coalition may be planning 
to take Baghdad and bring about the "implosion" of Saddam's regime. 
Having secured their supply lines to Kuwait in the south and surrounded 
the city with troops from the 7th Armoured Brigade, in recent days 
the British have begun surgical ground and air strikes against key 
symbols of the Iraqi leader's power. "The targeting and eradication 
of the Baath party within Basra province is now our primary focus 
and military main effort," British spokesman Colonel Chris Vernon 
told reporters in Kuwait City on Saturday. In one attack, British 
tanks made an incursion to destroy a statue of Saddam and disable 
the local television station, which was being used by the ruling Baath 
party to spread propaganda. "We are conducting aggressive patrols 
specifically targeting Baath party personnel to drive a wedge between 
the regime and the people," said Marcus Deville, a civilian spokesman 
for the British forces. At the same time as they attack Saddam's power 
structures in the city, British troops have also been using humanitarian 
relief and radio broadcasts to try to win over the terrified population. 
In one example on Monday, the strategies intersected. A Baath party 
headquarters five kilometres (three miles) southeast of the city was 
captured and British soldiers said they allowed civilians to loot 
vast stocks of food. Meanwhile the British have began broadcasting 
propaganda of their own into the homes of Basra's 1.2 million people. 
Between Western pop hits and traditional Arab music, an announcer 
says the days of the regime are numbered. Coalition commanders initially 
hoped to ignite a popular rebellion in Basra. The city has a mainly 
Shiite population which has been brutally supressed by the largely 
Sunni Muslim regime in Baghdad. "The planning assumption had always 
been that the advancing coalition forces would simply sweep past Basra 
and it would implode by itself," said Brigadier Jim Dutton, commander 
of 3 Commando Brigade. But the rebellion has failed to materialise 
and the Iraqi troops are putting up a determined defence. Some residents 
say they dare not rise up against Saddam's Baath party fighters until 
they can be sure the foreign troops are serious about finishing the 
job. The US government urged Iraq's Shiites to rebel after the last 
Gulf War in 1991, but failed to back the uprising with military support. 
Thousands were murdered in the ensuing crackdown. Fleeing civilians 
have told reporters the Saddam loyalists are killing men who refuse 
to fight. Several have said they were leaving to make it easier for 
the British to take the city. On a larger scale, a similar modus operandi 
is unfolding as US troops close on Baghdad. Whether or not it succeeds 
remains to be seen, but the Americans insist that despite the tenacious 
resistance they have encountered in the south, the people of Iraq 
share their desire for regime change. "We remain convinced of what 
we're seeing across the country, as we're having more and more success, 
that the Iraqi people are welcoming the departure of the regime and 
its destruction," US General Vincent Brooks said at Central Command 
base Monday. The most spectacular attempt to kill those around Saddam 
was the March 20 bombing of a bunker where the CIA had located the 
Iraqi leader and his sons Qusay and Uday, a day before the military 
was to begin the bombing of Baghdad. On Monday alone, air strikes 
targeted a Baath party headquarters in the central town of Al Hillah, 
a military headquarters building in the west, an intelligence centre 
in Karbala, also in the centre, and Saddam's cherished Republican 
Palace in Baghdad. But Vincent stressed that air strikes were only 
the most visible part of the strategy. Also at work were squads of 
special forces agents, he said. "Coalition special operations forces 
continue their operations and actions throughout Iraq. They're facilitating 
attacks against regime targets and death squads within urban areas," 
he said. "These attacks are enabled by information provided by the 
local populations." smc/rm/tm Iraq-war-Basra-Baghdad

Once no more than a tiny town in a tiny country, As-Saliyah has suddenly 
been thrust into the world spotlight to the mixed reaction of locals, 
who seem to care more about the noise than the US military coordinating 
the Iraq war from here. This patch of scrub desert 15 kilometers (10 
miles) outside Qatar's capital Doha has only 1,500 residents, close 
to the number of military personnel who have come here as part of 
the US Central Command. "The base is relatively far from the residential 
area, and we don't see them," said Ali Jaber al-Merri. But his son, 
with him at the local mosque, said the worst part was the constant 
landings, takeoff and overflights of warplanes -- particularly at 
night, when many of the attacks on Iraq take place. The war plane 
issue has become an issue in local politics. Abdullah Ahmed al-Zyara, 
campaigning in the As-Saliyah constituency for April 7 municipal elections, 
said: "The residents I've been talking to are complaining about the 
noise of the planes." "My campaign platform includes the issue of 
environmental protection, because noise is a form of pollution," he 
said. But Hamad bin Nura al-Merri, a member of the outgoing municipal 
council, has come to the opposite conclusion. "No one is complaining 
about it," he said. As-Saliyah residents "have gotten used to military 
maneuvers, which have traditionally taken place in the region." Some 
of the noises are more disturbing than others. Mohammed al-Merri, 
25, recalled the explosion near the base on March 23. No one was hurt 
in the blast, which Qatari authorities said was triggered by gas in 
the tank of a car being crushed at a demolition site a little more 
than a kilometer (three-quarters of a mile) away. But the mere presence 
of the US military behemoth here is enough to keep many Qataris at 
a distance. While As-Saliyah has become the venue for daily briefings 
by Central Command carried live by television networks the world over, 
more immediate neighbors are staying away. "My business has fallen 
by 70 percent," complained Ali Masood al-Hababi, a car salesman at 
As-Saliyah. "My debts are growing and I don't have enough to pay the 
salaries of my employees," he said. Qatar, a small kingdom grown wealthy 
on oil and gas revenues, is considered one of the most pragmatic players 
in the Middle East. While Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani gave 
the United States a key venue for the war on Iraq, Qatar also hosts 
Al-Jazeera television, the all-news Arabic channel that has irritated 
Washington by its attention to Iraqi casualties and footage of US 
war dead. Thousands of other US troops are based elsewhere in Qatar 
at the Al-Udeid air base. For their own interests, many residents 
of As-Saliyah just hope the war is short. "I didn't get paid for months 
because customers have hesitated to come here since they started talking 
about installing an American base" last year, said Saleh Abu Futuh, 
an Egyptian employee at Hababi's car dealership. "I hope that this 
war doesn't last for long." fb/tm/sct/mc/rm Iraq-war-Qatar

Everybody who works with Ali Kadi aboard this US Navy aircraft carrier 
knows he is a Muslim but none of them seem to care. "I don't think 
borders exist, as far as this guy's Muslim, this guy's Catholic," 
Kadi, 38, told AFP. Born the son of Yemeni immigrants in the industrial 
town of Youngstown, Ohio, Kadi says he has been a practising Muslim 
all his life, including his almost 20 years spent in the US Navy. 
Kadi is a chief petty officer who supervises about 30 other sailors 
who control the flow of spare parts for the carrier's warplanes. He 
says he is one of about 10 followers of Islam among the Kitty Hawk's 
multicultural crew of more than 5,000. Kitty Hawk's attack fighters 
are bombing Iraq as part of the US-led war which has drawn strong 
criticism from Muslims around the world. In Bahrain, where the US 
Fifth Fleet is based, for example, people have demonstrated against 
what they see as US interference in their region to conduct a war 
of aggression against Islam. Many in Indonesia, the world's most populous 
Muslim nation, are generally suspicious of US policy in the Middle 
East. They see it as being unfair to Muslims and Palestinians in particular. 
Kadi does not see things that way, saying people in those countries 
"need to taste" freedom and democracy. "Then they'll have different 
views of the United States and its policies," he said in his cramped 
office that resembles an automotive parts depot, with components wrapped 
in plastic and new tires lined up on the floor. "I believe it is the 
goal of the United States to make the Middle East more democratic, 
more free than it is right now," he said, echoing arguments used by 
the administration of US President George W. Bush. "I don't think 
religion has anything to do with it," Kadi said. Religion does not 
have much to do with navy work either. "I really don't look at somebody 
as Catholic or Christian. I look at a sailor as blue," Kadi said, 
referring to the colour of their uniforms. "It works," he said. "Everybody 
gets things done as a team." His father worked in Youngstown steel 
mills for three decades and also ran a variety store. "It was called 
Sammy's Quick Stop. It was on the corner, not that far from my house," 
he said. Asked whether he ever faced discrimination as he grew up, 
he said, "Anywhere you go, to say there's no discrimination whatsoever, 
zero, would be a lie." After living in Yemen for about six years as 
a teenager he returned to the US and faced a choice afer high school: 
join the family business or enlist in the navy. Kadi said he joined 
the military partly to see the world but also "to do my duty" and 
to show "that even Muslims are patriotic." After serving elsewhere 
Kadi joined the Kitty Hawk in May two years ago in time for the ship's 
support of operations in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks 
by Islamic terrorists who killed thousands in New York and Washington. 
Even then, Kadi said he never heard abusive comments about Muslims. 
"The only derogatory things I heard was from the media," he said. 
Tacked to the wall above his desk is a photo of his daughter, Sophia, 
five, wearing a Japanese kimono. The Kitty Hawk is based in Yokosuka, 
Japan, where Kadi has lived intermittently for seven years between 
stints in the US and Guam. His wife is Japanese. They are thinking 
about living in Egypt and then Malaysia when he retires from the navy. 
"I just want to experience other cultures. We want to travel. We're 
like Bedouins," he said. But for now there is a war to support, and 
Kadi says he is backing it all the way just like his fellow sailors, 
many of whom were raised in other countries. "Our backgrounds, even 
though they're varied, deep down inside we support whatever the president 
says," Kadi said. Before the war, he would join a couple of fellow 
Muslims for prayers on Fridays, the Muslim holy day, in the ship's 
chapel which serves all faiths. Now his 15-hour workdays make that 
Friday appointment and even daily prayer obligations harder to keep. 
"You can always make up for it later on," Kadi said. "Sometimes I'll 
just pray in my heart." it/hc/tm Iraq-US-navy-Muslim

Germany warned the public Tuesday against travelling to Algeria's 
Sahara desert after several Europeans, including up to a dozen Germans, 
were reported missing there. Diplomats said on Tuesday that six Germans, 
four men and two women, who were touring the southern Algerian desert 
in three four-wheel-drive vehicles had disappeared. Their relatives 
said they were "very worried" about the group and had not had any 
word from them since a phone call on March 17, the diplomats said. 
The disappearances bring to 17 the number of tourists reported to 
have gone missing without a trace in the north African country since 
late February. On February 21, 11 European tourists -- six Germans, 
four Swiss and one Dutch -- went missing in southern Algeria. bb-loc/jkb

US Marines fight for Playboy spirit in Iraqi desert by Ned Parker 
ATTENTION - CONTAINS LANGUAGE in para 18 some clients may deem offensive 
/// CENTRAL IRAQ, April 1 (AFP) - After two months in Kuwait and two 
weeks in Iraq, many US Marines are grousing about why they are here 
-- they hate the desert and the gas masks they wear. They just want 
to "clobber Saddam" and go home. There is too much time to think. 
Days, hours drag between the hard pumping action of a firefight and 
the next adrenaline rush. Often they find themselves logjammed on 
Iraqi highways, bumper to bumper with hardback and highback Humvees, 
M1-A1 Abrams tanks and seven-tonne trucks. They speed by abandoned 
picnic reststops where yellow umbrella stands have blown off the tables. 
They broil in their camouflage-green chemical suits and yawn on highways 
that resemble their home country's famed Route 66 and hope to see 
American gas stations and convenience stores selling beer around the 
bend. Bored, they christen their vehicles "The Redneck Rampage", "Disposable 
Heroes" and "Boyz Gone Wild". They draw pictures of topless women 
and flash their sketches at the next car and hoot. One Humvee plays 
the singalong game called "Vietnam", where they take turns belting 
out 1960s pop tunes. A mechanic's truck down the way cranks out heavy 
metal. The marines thumb copies of Maxim, a magazine of skimpily-clad 
models that is a thin step up from porn and as such is banned by a 
US military sensitive to Muslim customs. One marine writes letters 
to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. "Dear Mr Hefner, old copies of your 
magazine have raised morale and inspired many marines and sailors 
here. "Your example of the American can-do spirit and innovation is 
what we're fighting for in Iraq. It would be a great if a couple of 
marines could meet you after the war." Rumours spread. Some are charming 
... Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez are coming out on tour, some 
say. Others rattle the mind and morale: US soldiers are said to have 
been executed on Iraqi television. Conversations turn to the anti-war 
protests unfolding around the world. They call the demonstrators "dumb", 
complain the troops had more support in the 1991 Gulf War and say 
the protesters have no idea what the marines are really doing on the 
ground. Others badmouth the BBC news which they receive off shortwave 
radio, their main source of information. They call it negative, liberal 
"horseshit". People talk of hamburger joints and strip clubs, punk 
rock and Country and Western singer Hank Williams, Filipino curry, 
God and college basketball. They wear their patriotism proudly and 
wrestle with their doubts. An infantryman boasts that he is ready 
to be part of a modern-day Roman legion to rid the world of terrorists, 
while a medic wonders how many countries the White House will ask 
him to invade before the world is safe. A young missile expert says 
the war is worthwhile, if it eases the suffering of the Iraqi children 
he has seen clutching their bellies and begging for food. Nineteen-year-olds 
from big cities, away from home for the first time, struggle to find 
strength. They attend impromptu religious services on Sundays if a 
chaplain turns up, and tell the chaplain they did not believe in God 
until they arrived in Iraq. np/hc/tm Iraq-war-troops-morale

Reservist Ernie Firkin will be deployed to the Gulf any day now, part 
of the next wave of US Marines to join the war on Iraq. Like many 
of his buddies in the Corps, he has decided he wants his dog tag permanently 
tattooed on his torso. Firkin and Roger Eiser, a fellow Devil Dog, 
headed off base Saturday to one of the many tattoo parlors in Jacksonville, 
North Carolina, the civilian backyard of Camp LeJeune, home to some 
43,000 Marines. Weekends are busy at Primal Ink, says Jessica Lakes, 
whose boyfriend Phillip Peters owns the parlor. "After they've partied 
and got their tattoos, they get their hair cut before going to work 
on Monday." Customers usually come in twos or threes, shooting pool 
or watching TV in the lounge where hundreds of designs are displayed 
on the wall and in swinging panels. But Firkin, who already has "USMC" 
-- for US Marine Corps -- tattooed on his back, was only interested 
in having his name, social security number, service branch and blood 
type permanently emblazoned on the left side of his torso, by the 
bottom couple of ribs. Such a tattoo, known as a "meat tag," was devised 
"so if you get blown up they can identify you," Peters said. "I've 
heard it called the largest piece of you left." Lakes added: "They 
get them so they can be buried with full honors and with their families." 
Noting that these days Primal Ink's three artists do about 50 meat 
tags a week, with spikes coming after pay days, Lakes said some customers 
were motivated by the brutal reputation of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
Eiser, who had selected an arm band design for his left bicep, was 
doubtful. "If you hit an anti-personnel mine it don't matter what 
you got on. ... I ain't getting a meat tag. What's the point of that? 
You got your dog tags hanging on your neck." Undeterred, Firkin double-checked 
his meat tag's vital information before Peters made a stencil of the 
simple artwork for transfer onto his ribs. The artist, wearing green 
surgical gloves, took the precaution of taping gauze over Firkin's 
fresh small pox vaccination before the 24-year-old from Woodbridge, 
Virginia, lay back in a reclining seat, similar to a dentist's chair, 
to go under the electric tattoo needle. Firkin said his father liked 
to say "It don't tickle," but he betrayed no discomfort through the 
20-minute procedure carried out on a notoriously sensitive part of 
the body. "Ribs is a tender area," said an artist named Butch at another 
parlor, Fantasy Tattoo. Getting a meat tag "is a way of showing that 
you don't mind suffering a little bit to show who you are." He said: 
"If you're 'about it' (being a Marine), you make a sacrifice." The 
Marines get meat tags, a custom that dates back to the Vietnam War, 
"because they're Marines." Thus for some tattoo lovers, the meat tag 
goes far beyond its practical purpose, inspiring a variety of gory 
embellishments such as a trompe l'oeil design depicting an open wound 
with the dog tag strung around a rib. Meanwhile, back at Primal Ink, 
as Eiser was getting his bicep tattoo, the TV was tuned to NBC news, 
reporting that the bodies of four US soldiers had been found in a 
shallow grave, one of which had been severely mutilated. gd/pfm Iraq-war-US-tattoo

Fearful of possible terrorist attacks or other repurcussions from 
the war in Iraq and unrest in the Middle East, tourists are looking 
increasingly to Latin America for a safe holiday destination. Faced 
with such uncertainty, Europeans and Americans "who were thinking 
of travelling to north Africa or the Middle East have changed their 
reservations and are becoming interested in Latin America," said World 
Tourism Organisation spokesman Rok Klancnik. Additionally, "the currencies 
of the different (Latin American) countries are weak and they are 
linked to the dollar, which in turn continues to fall against the 
euro," said Hugo Gonzalez, director of Latin American Travel Agents 
Committee. In Argentina, these factors have meant growth of 39.5 percent 
in the tourism sector during January and February, compared to the 
same period last year, according to the country's tourism secretariat. 
In March, the number of tourists visiting Cuba was up 20 percent up 
on the same period last year, according to the Caribbean News Digital 
website. The Dominican Republic experienced similar growth, with 149,808 
people visiting the country by air in the first two weeks of March, 
compared with 125,743 the year before. "I have been in contact with 
all the operators and everything is going very well," said Dominican 
Tourism Minister Rafael Subervi. After two years of losses, tourism 
in Chile has also increased during summer in the southern hemisphere, 
according to the country's national tourism service Sernatur which 
registered growth of 2.7 percent. Sernatur director Oscar Santelices 
believes the war in Iraq represents an opportunity for local businesses, 
a sentiment echoed by Roque Sevilla, head of the chamber of tourism 
in Pichincha province, Ecuador. German and French tourists who had 
previously planned holidays in the United States have changed their 
plans after the bad feeling generated over their governments' opposition 
to war in Iraq, Sevilla noted. "They want a new destination, and that 
destination is Ecuador," he said. But not all Latin American tourism 
professionals are so optimistic. Jean Holder, head of the Caribbean 
Tourism Organisation, told the Financial Times that war in Iraq could 
have an adverse effect on tourism in the region. The US-led invasion 
was a new blow to an industry which was just beginning to recover 
from the severe blow dealt it by the September 11, 2001 attacks in 
the United States, he said. Travellers who might normally choose to 
holiday in the Middle East would not switch to the Caribbean as they 
did in 1991 Gulf War, because the current conflict with Iraq was perceived 
to have far greater international ramifications. Mexican Tourism Minister 
Leticia Navarro meantime felt that the effect of the war on tourism 
would depend on the duration of the conflict. According to the newspaper 
Reforma, the flow of tourists to Mexico -- which is predominantly 
from the United States -- dropped by 17 percent in the first two days 
of the war. ml/jsl/ch Iraq-war-LatAm-tourism

Real-time media coverage of the conflict in Iraq has given the world 
an unprecedented window on modern warfare, but it has also wreaked 
havoc on financial markets as dealers react to a steady drip of "breaking 
news". With more than 500 journalists, equipped with the latest technology, 
"embedded" with US and British troops and a few dozen holed up in 
Baghdad, the war has provided round-the-clock coverage for armchair 
viewers and nervous traders alike. The rapid rise of all-news television 
channels such as CNN, BBC World and Sky News, which have been competing 
fiercely for viewers, has reduced dealers' dependency on newswire 
services for the latest battlefield reports. And while cost-cutting 
by financial firms has forced many dealers to rely on just one financial 
information provider, the relatively low cost of subscribing to news 
channels means that most dealing rooms are now peppered with TV screens. 
"On our trading floor we've got seven television screens, all of them 
either with Sky News, CNN, CNBC, the BBC or any news broadcasting 
corporation," said Kamal Sharma, a forex analyst at Commerzbank. "We 
now have dedicated news channels that can get us up to date with the 
latest news." The media coverage of the current conflict contrasts 
with the strict controls imposed by the US military in the 1991 Gulf 
War when only small pools of US reporters were placed with front-line 
units. This time, the early images of allied tanks rolling through 
southern Iraq unimpeded and the US "shock and awe" bombing of Baghdad 
sent shares on Wall Street skyrocketing to their best weekly performance 
in 20 years. But when the reporting from the Gulf later began to highlight 
a string of setbacks suffered by the coalition troops and question 
the pace of their advance, markets quickly went into reverse. "The 
news which came out of Iraq during the first week of the conflict 
was almost universally good for the Anglo-American forces," recalls 
Jim Wood-Smith, head analyst at Gerrard Stockbrokers. "Over the course 
of the first weekend, it appeared that most of what was reported during 
the previous week was in fact false and that all the cities and towns 
we'd been told had fallen in fact hadn't. "When you have no idea what 
the information that's going to be given to you is, or whether it's 
true or not, it makes for a slightly uneasy time," he said. How dealers 
view the coalition forces' progress in the war may even depend on 
what time of the day they tune into the coverage, according to Commerzbank 
analysts. They have detected a pattern under which the dollar and 
British pound -- seen as the most exposed of the major currencies 
to the risks of the war -- tend to advance in the Asian session before 
falling back in European and US trade. "Anyone watching CNN, CNBC, 
BBC World and the others in the Asia time zone might believe that 
victory was assured," the analysts wrote. "A night-time blitz on Baghdad 
makes impressive TV coverage and reinforces the notion of US military 
might. The US dollar and British pound both rally. "By the light of 
morning, however, and as European traders read newspapers which are 
generally more objective than the 'embedded' reports from Iraq, so 
the mood turns much more negative, pushing both currencies lower," 
they added. But after almost two weeks of non-stop coverage of the 
war, dealers are more cautious about so-called breaking news stories 
flashing up on TV screens. "I think there's a bit of war weariness 
on the part of markets," said Sharma. "There's a couple of news headlines 
that the market would definitely react to and that's the unconditional 
surrender of Iraq, the fate of Saddam Hussein and the allies declaring 
victory -- those are the ones that matter now," he added. dr/pw/vs

The US-led war against Iraq could prompt thousands of Islamic extremists 
still on the loose in Afghanistan to take up arms, Tajik analysts 
have warned. Moreover "if the anti-terrorist coalition loses control 
of the situation in Afghanistan, this will impact on Central Asian 
security," analyst Sukhrob Sharipov told AFP. "Pan-Islamic moods are 
prevailing, and Afghanistan's radical fanatics who are currently hidden 
away like ants will regroup," with Washington's attention riveted 
on Iraq, he added. According to a military source who preferred to 
remain anonymous, "the Taliban boasted of having up to 30,000 fighters," 
compared with just a few hundred now imprisoned at the US military 
base in Guantanamo. "That means the rest are hiding among the civilian 
population," he said. Spring traditionally favours a new outburst 
of violence in war-torn Afghanistan, he noted. Taliban guerrillas 
would find willing allies in local radical groups such as the Islamic 
Movement of Uzbekistan which features on Washington's blacklist of 
terrorist organisations, he said. The movement's guerrillas were trained 
at Taliban bases and would leap at the chance to wreak havoc in their 
native Uzbekistan, which they aim to turn into an Islamic state, analysts 
warned. The leader of the Islamic party Tajik Rebirth, Said Abdulla 
Nuri, warned that "the ongoing war in Iraq will lead to the reactivation 
of the terrorist groups that have not been liquidated, including (members 
of) the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan who have crossed back into 
Uzbekistan." Meanwhile, Russian border guards and Tajik officials 
also voiced alarm at the high level of drug trafficking, unlikely 
to abate f Afghanistan's shattered economy is left without its pledged 
hefty restoration budget as international attention shifts elsewhere. 
Tajikistan is traditionally the first stop for heroin and opium from 
Afghanistan to be smuggled to Western markets. Both before and since 
the collapse of the radical Islamic Taliban regime in November 2001, 
Afghanistan has been the main supplier of heroin to Europe. Last year, 
Russian and Tajik guards posted along Tajikistan's 1,340-kilometre 
(840-mile) border with Afghanistan seized 6.7 tonnes of drugs, including 
four tonnes of heroin, and killed more than 50 suspected drug traffickers. 
Poppy cultivation sharply increased after the ouster of Afghanistan's 
hardline Taliban regime nearly a year and a half ago, which had banned 
production of opium and its derivative heroin. Afghanistan, currently 
ruled by an interim administration, produces three-quarters of the 
world's opium. Nevertheless, Tajikistan has been unwilling to dampen 
Dushanbe's ties with Washington by intervening on Iraq's behalf, analysts 
said. "Tajikistan is right to remain neutral. It is not that we don't 
care about the Iraqi people's fate, the conflict must be resolved 
politically," lawmaker Shodi Shabdolov said. "We have no reason to 
spoil our relations with the United States, which give a huge amount 
of humanitarian aid to Tajiks. We have lots of problems, and must 
first of all get our country out of its social and economic crisis, 
" Sharipov said. ab-ca/bb/tm Iraq-war-Tajikistan-Afghanistan

Malaysia's exotic frontier state Sabah is enjoying a tourist boom 
despite worldwide woes over terrorism, war and pestilence. With nearby 
Indonesia ravaged by last October's Bali bombing and Thailand experiencing 
saturation and over-development in popular resorts, Sabah's laid-back 
charm has won over affluent Asians and long-haul travellers. Arrivals 
in Malaysia's second largest state on the northern tip of Borneo island 
surged 21 percent to hit 1.1 million last year, with tourist receipts 
up 16 percent to nearly one billion ringgit (263 million dollars). 
The bulk of visitors are from within Asia, with affluent pensioners 
from Britain and Ireland also accounting for a large group, industry 
officials say. This year, Sabah aims to lure 1.3 million visitors 
to pump in 1.4 billion ringgit into its coffers despite the Iraq war 
and the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak which 
has killed more than 60 people worldwide. Hoteliers and tourism officials 
say they are prepared for a tough month but are optimistic that the 
industry, which has survived a series of setbacks over the past six 
years, will remain resilient. "This is not the first time we are facing 
a crisis. The war and the SARS will have a slight impact but this 
is temporary," Reto Klauser, general manager of the five-star Shangri-La 
Rasa Ria Resort, told AFP. "We expect a tough April but my outlook 
for the rest of the year is still good." Tourism is Sabah's third 
largest foreign exchange earner after agriculture and timber, and 
the industry is no stranger to crises. Its close proximity to southern 
Philippines, where the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Abu Sayyaf 
Muslim terror groups operate, has brought a slew of problems. Abu 
Sayyaf rebels raided Sabah's popular diving resort of Sipadan in April 
2000 and took 21 hostages, including 12 foreign tourists. Following 
the September 11 attacks in the United States and the Bali bombing, 
the state was blacklisted in the travel advisories of several Western 
countries over terrorism fears. Sabah has also been entangled in a 
territorial dispute with Indonesia over resource-rich Sipadan and 
Ligitan islands, but last year notched up a victory when the World 
Court in The Hague ruled that the two islands belonged to Malaysia. 
Despite all the headaches, tourists continued to flock to the state. 
Tourism officials noted arrivals surged sharply by 60 percent year-on-year 
to 774,475 in 2000 despite the kidnappings, and rose 19 percent in 
2001 and 21 percent last year to break the one million mark. Sabah 
Tourism Board market communication manager Noredah Othman said cruise 
ships and many regional tourists diverted to the state last year after 
the attacks on the United States and the Bali bombing. The board aims 
to lure more visitors from China, Japan and South Korea this year, 
with plans for improved air linkages in the region and to Australia 
over the next few months, she said. "Long-haul travellers especially 
top spenders from the US, Britain and Germany will decrease but we 
aim to garner regional markets especially in North Asia," she said. 
Security concerns continue to cast a shadow over Sabah but officials 
pin their hopes on the state's natural attractions to help lift the 
cloud. Sabah is home to Southeast Asia's highest peak, Mount Kinabalu, 
as well as many protected rare mammals and flora. Some of the world's 
most prized diving spots dot its outlying islands. "Many people have 
forgotten what natural friendliness and unspoilt hospitality really 
are because of over-commercialised destinations. Sabah can give that 
to tourists and that's not so easy to find these days," said Shangri-La's 
Klauser. en/lb/br/mfc Malaysia-tourism-Sabah

NEAR NAJAF, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US troops shot dead seven women 
and children at a checkpoint in central Iraq, US officials said Tuesday, 
as Baghdad claimed that US warplanes had attacked a group of "human 
shields." The reports came after a night of intense bombardments on 
Baghdad, where four divisions of President Saddam Hussein's elite 
Republican Guard were dug in to defend the capital from any ground 
attack by US and British forces. Saddam's main presidential palace 
complex in the Iraqi capital, a potent symbol of his iron 24-year 
rule, came under fresh daylight bombardment on Tuesday for the second 
consecutive day, an AFP reporter said. The palace grounds have been 
a frequent target in the bombing. Iraqi Information Minister Mohammad 
Said al-Sahhaf said that 18 people were killed and more than 100 wounded 
since late Monday. According to Iraqi officials, hundreds of civilians 
have been killed in the 13-day-old war. He added that several people 
were wounded Monday in the western town of Rutba when a US warplane 
attacked two buses carrying international volunteers, some of them 
US citizens, who were in the country as "human shields." US Brigadier 
General Vincent Brooks told reporters at Central Command's forward 
planning base in Qatar that he was unable to confirm the report. US 
forces meanwhile stepped up military operations south of Baghdad ahead 
of an expected major push on the Iraqi capital. The checkpoint shooting 
occurred at Najaf, 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad on Monday 
afternoon, Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said at operational 
headquarters in Qatar. The incident, together with continual bombing 
on Baghdad, was thought likely to fuel vocal international opposition 
to the war and undermine US efforts to win support from the Iraqi 
people. Owens said the victims, seven women and children, were in 
a civilian vehicle that failed to stop at the military post despite 
repeated warning shots fired by US troops. Four people in the vehicle 
escaped unharmed. The Washington Post reported that 10 civilians had 
been killed in the incident and quoted US Army 3rd Division Captain 
Ronny Johnson as shouting over the radio to his men after the shooting: 
"You just (expletive) killed a family because you didn't fire a warning 
shot soon enough." In Qatar, Owens countered that: "As a last resort, 
they (US troops) fired into the passenger compartment of the vehicle," 
and said that an investigation had been opened. In central Iraq, the 
commander of the Third Infantry Division, Major General Buford Blount, 
said: "We're very concerned... and very sorry that it happened." With 
US troops on edge after a suicide car bomb attack Saturday near Najaf 
killed four soldiers, Blount stressed that the unit that opened fire 
at the checkpoint had respected their rules of engagement. Brooks 
added: "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they remain 
unavoidable as they have been throughout history." In Geneva the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it regretted the incident and 
that it hoped US troops took "all the necessary measures" to warn 
the civilians before opening fire. Spokeswoman Antonella Notari said 
civilians must be spared as much as possible, but acknowledged that 
military authorities had the right to try to ensure the safety of 
their troops. Iraqi citizens living through nightly bombardments on 
Baghdad saw the capital come under a fresh and intense wave of bombing. 
AFP reporters said the raids on Baghdad were growing more intense 
and that the barrage late Monday seemed to be the heaviest yet to 
have hit the battered city's downtown area. A plume of smoke rose 
into the air after a missile or smart bomb crashed into the heart 
of the presidential compound Tuesday. In the north, coalition warplanes 
kept up heavy airstrikes on Iraqi army positions in and around the 
oil centre of Kirkuk, rebel Kurdish officials said. In Kuwait, air 
raid sirens sounded for the first time since Saturday. A defence ministry 
spokesman later said an Iraqi missile had been shot down over southern 
Iraq. The US Army's elite 101st Airborne division stepped up its campaign 
around Najaf after killing several opposition fighters and taking 
another 20 prisoner, military officials said. The "Screaming Eagles" 
began the third day of their campaign to secure the areas south and 
north of the Shiite Muslim holy city by sending in another battalion 
of Apache attack helicopters to support infantry troops. Najaf and 
Karbala, another Shiite pilgrimage city a further 80 kilometres (50 
miles) closer to Baghdad, are considered vital to securing communication 
and supply lines in the push toward the Iraqi capital. In Qatar, Brooks 
said that US forces had captured an Iraqi general in fighting in the 
Karbala region: "The attacks were very effective and resulted in the 
capture of an Iraqi general with very valuable information." South 
of the capital, US troops reported their first serious fighting with 
the Republican Guard, considered Iraq's most determined military unit 
and key to the defense of Baghdad. US officers said 200 Iraqis were 
killed, wounded or captured in the clashes which broke out overnight 
near Karbala, 80 kilometers from Baghdad. Reports of the battle around 
Karbala came as US armoured units finalised plans for a decisive thrust 
toward Baghdad within a week, commanders said, with forces concentrated 
near Najaf, to the south. In Basra, seen as key to controlling the 
southeast, British troops said they were waiting for reinforcements 
before making a final push to take the city. Flight Lieutenant Peter 
Darling said British troops were "nibbling at the edges" of Iraqi 
defences in the city of more than one million people which is seen 
as a vital staging post for humanitarian supplies. British commanders 
said 600 soldiers backed by tanks and armoured vehicles were battling 
to punch through the town of Abu Al Khasib, 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
to the southeast of Basra, as British artillery pounded Basra's western 
edge. An Iraqi military spokesman said at least 54 US and British 
soldiers had been killed in fighting since Sunday, most of them around 
Basra, with an unspecified number of others killed in other parts 
of Iraq. Officials in London said a British soldier was killed on 
duty in southern Iraq, taking to 26 the British death toll since the 
start of the war. US authorities say at least 39 US soldiers have 
been killed. In Baghdad, a regime spokesman denied reports that members 
of Saddam's family were trying to flee the country. "The fate of his 
family cannot be separated from that of the extended family (the Iraqi 
people)," he said, quoted by state television. The denial came after 
US Defence Department Spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said: "We have seen 
evidence that family members are fleeing the country, or trying to 
flee the country." Stock markets in Asia and Europe stabilised, the 
dollar bounced back slightly and oil prices slipped amid increased 
investor confidence. In Brussels, a diplomatic source said that US 
Secretary of State Colin Powell could hold discussions on Iraq with 
European Union foreign ministers on Thursday. In Russia, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Alexander Losyukov said the war was likely to fuel North 
Korea's nuclear ambitions. Diplomatic sources in Jordan said authorities 
had foiled two Iraqi plots to attack US interests in its western neighbour, 
including a bid to poison the water supply of US troops and an attempted 
bombing of a luxury hotel. burs-jah/yad Iraq-worldwrap

Thousands of Austrian school children have thrown themselves into 
a project to chronicle the fate of 80,000 Holocaust victims after 
their parents and grandparents for decades chose to ignore a tragic 
chapter in Austria's history. The Nazis killed some 65,000 Jews, as 
well as 15,000 gypsies, handicapped people, homosexuals and political 
opponents in the seven years they ran the country following its annexation 
in 1938. "Students Write History" was a project launched by two journalists, 
who say they are surprised by its success. Andreas Kuba, 37, used 
to write extensively about the country's political far right but says 
he stopped when he realised that he was in fact helping them to disseminate 
their views. His partner, the year younger Josef Neymayr, says in 
a country that long tried to forget its collaboration with Adolf Hitler, 
the project "is a way to assume responsibility for our past." "We 
got the idea when we saw the list of the names of the 65,000 Jews 
who were killed by the Nazis. The figure itself shocked us, but there 
was something missing -- the human element." Since the project began 
in January with support by the education ministry, it has simply snowballed. 
"There are 492 institutions working with us, 11 new schools signed 
up in just four days. The ministry expected about a third" of that, 
Neumayr said. Austrian state schools only started teaching the history 
of Nazism and the Third Reich in the late 1980s and in their enthusiasm 
the students almost seem to be making up for lost time. "What we are 
particularly pleased about, is the impact the project has had on Austrian 
society as a whole," Neumayr told AFP. "Many descendants of those 
who were deported have contacted us and asked to be put in touch with 
the youth working on the project," he said, adding that the project 
was helping to bring the generations together. Sometimes the students 
search the project's website for a particular individual whom their 
grandparents remember by date of birth, former home address or place 
and date of deportation. They also draw on files of Holocaust victims 
created by the Documentation Center on Austrian Resistance, as well 
as municipal archives and back issues of newspapers from World War 
II. History or religion teachers are monitoring their progress, while 
six historians are working on the project full time. For the past 
three weeks, 32 pupils at a Vienna school have have been mapping the 
lives of 16 victims of anti-Semitism and the Nazis' genetic engineering 
experiments. Lena Opitz, 16, has chosen to write the story of a Jewish 
woman by the same first name, while her classmate. 16-year-old Sabine 
Hofbauer tackled that of a presumed distant relative who was deported 
to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. "You do not just 
learn the dates and the facts, like in an ordinary class, you start 
to understand what it all meant," 15-year-old Elisabeth Hafner said. 
"My mother and aunt are very interested in this because they have 
always wanted to learn more about this period," she added. So far, 
the students are working on more than 2,100 biographies. "Of course 
our aim is to do all 80,000 but it is not really the number that matters," 
Neumayr said. The project was initially due to finish at the end of 
2003 but he said it would "surely carry over into next year" given 
the enthusiasm of the students and the sponsors. There were originally 
10 sponsors but three news companies have recently joined in. For 
all their fervour, participants sometimes run into roadblocks. Students 
have had to give up looking for information about certain Holocaust 
victims because it is too hard to obtain and concentrate on others, 
said Walpurge Marhold, the headmaster at the Vienna school. "The students 
are disappointed. They thought they would quickly find information 
and photographs, but it is not that easy," said Stephan Roth, a historian 
working on the project. sj/ef/tm Austria-Nazis

Two coalition warplanes on Tuesday dropped laser-guided munitions 
on an Iraqi radio relay facility near the western desert outpost of 
Rutba, the US Central Command said. "The Coalition targeted the station 
to erode the command and control capabilities of regime leaders," 
a statement said, restating part of the strategy of US-led forces 
to try to bring down President Saddam President. "A full assessment 
of the strike's effectiveness is in progress," Centrol Command added.

The Nepalese government's failure to announce an official negotiating 
team for peace talks with the Maoists has delayed a preliminary goodwill 
meeting, rebel sources said Tuesday. "The government has not yet constituted 
the negotiating team to hold the peace dialogue even two months after 
the declaration of a ceasefire," a highly placed Maoist source said. 
The government and the rebels declared a ceasefire on January 29, 
but a date for talks to end seven years of insurgency has not yet 
been set. Government negotiator Naryan Singh Pun had said last week 
a goodwill meeting could take place Tuesday. But Prime Minister Lokendra 
Bahadur Chand said Monday only that the talks would start soon. "I 
want to assure the peace dialogue will start soon with the objective 
of restoring peace and order in the country," he said. In March both 
sides signed a code of conduct for the talks, says both sides are 
committed to finding a peaceful solution through dialogue, will stop 
violent activities including strikes and kidnappings, gradually release 
prisoners and not obstruct the transport of food and medicine. "The 
government has not strictly followed the code of conduct agreement 
nor has it been serious about the holding of peace dialogue for over 
two months," the Maoist source said. The rebels have been fighting 
for a communist republic in Nepal since 1996 and the uprising has 
claimed over 7,800 lives. kms/an/rcw Nepal-Maoist

Georgian and US officials have discussed coalition forces using airbases 
in the former Soviet republic for the Iraq war, but Washington has 
yet to make a formal request, a top Georgian official said Tuesday. 
"The use of Georgian military infrastructure, in particular air bases, 
by US forces in their anti-Iraq campaign, has been discussed by both 
sides," Deputy Defence Minister, Gela Bezhuashvili, told AFP. "President 
Eduard Shevardnadze has repeatedly said that Georgia is an active 
member of the anti-Iraq coalition and in these conditions such a prospect 
is forseeable, even if no official US request has been made yet," 
he added. The US embassy in Tbilisi, however, denied local media reports 
that US military experts had already visited an airfield in Georgia 
with a view to using it for operations in Iraq. A regional presidential 
envoy, Temur Shashiashvili, told a newspaper last week that US experts 
had visited the Kopitnar military airfield, which is about 500 kilometers 
(300 miles) north of Iraq, "twice in the past few days." Georgia, 
which is seeking closer ties with the United States to counterbalance 
Russian influence, is one of more than 30 countries that have openly 
declared support for the operation in Iraq which started on March 
20th. US military personnel have been in Georgia since last year, 
training local troops in antiterrorist techniques. nt-ig/hm/jkb Iraq-war-US-Georgia

Nearly 400 people fell ill, with 60 hospitalized, after they ate bacteria-laden 
ham at a restaurant in central China's Henan province, Chinese media 
said Tuesday. The outbreak is one of the biggest in China, which is 
notorious for its mass poisoning cases. It follows an incident in 
September when 42 people died out of around 300 poisoned by breakfast 
snacks laced with rat poison in the Tangshan township of eastern city 
Nanjing. A rival snackshop owner was later executed for the crime. 
The Henan ham victims started vomiting and feeling faint after eating 
at the restaurant in a village on the outskirts of the city of Nanyang 
on March 24. Most of the victims had eaten at banquets at the restaurant, 
whose menu included a ham dish. The first victims arrived at hospitals 
the following morning and by night, 390 patients had been treated 
for similar symptoms. Investigators later found the ham, which was 
made by a food processing factory in northern China's Shaanxi province, 
contained several hundred times the amount of bacteria allowed by 
national food safety standards. Police have launched an investigation.

Never mind the bombings, here's the veggies -- Iraq's drivers deliver 
by Sammy Ketz = (PICTURES) = BAGHDAD, April 1 (AFP) - There are duststorms 
and checkpoints and a steady rain of bombs, but Sadjaj Murteij promises 
the fresh fruit and vegetables will keep coming to Baghdad. "It's 
our job to feed the capital," he says, as a crowd of his fellow lorry 
drivers nod in agreement. Every day, hundreds of drivers like Murteij 
brave the hazards of war and set out from Iraq's key agricultural 
areas in the south to deliver the goods to the city's five million 
residents. The potatoes come from Nasafiyah, the garlic from Kut, 
the green beans from Yusafiyah -- and the potential for trouble from 
just about everywhere. "Of course we're afraid of the missiles," says 
Mehdi Adi, after finishing another hair-raising eight-hour run from 
the Al-Zubayr region 600 kilometres (375 miles) to the south, where 
Iraq and US-led forces have been engaged in ferocious battles. "A 
week ago, a group of eight cars was wiped out," he says, as workers 
at the Rashid Market in south Baghdad's Dora district process his 
payload for today -- 10 tonnes of tomatoes. "Even if it falls on the 
side of the road, the fragments can slash your tyres when you're rolling 
at full speed," he says. For Adi and his colleagues, time is of the 
essence. Vegetable traders at the Rashid, and the fruit traders at 
the Jamila Souk just opposite, close at 2 pm every day. Those who 
don't get their business done in time stay overnight in Baghdad, which 
gets heavily bombed after dark. Meanwhile the long road across the 
Iraqi desert is full of surprises. Murteij says that what happens 
at the US army checkpoints which have sprung up here and there depends 
on how stressed out the soldiers are feeling. "Sometimes they just 
wave us through but when they're tense, they make us get out, search 
us and then use a metal detector to make sure we're not carrying any 
weapons," Murteij says. Hussein Ali, 23, says the US troops use Kuwaiti 
translators just in case. But when he was recently stopped near Nasariyah 
-- site of some of the most intense fighting of the war so far -- 
sign language was all it took. "The soldier was pointing at my haul, 
and then circling his finger to ask what it was. So I stuck a tomato 
out of my window," he says. Adel Amin Hussein, one of the 54 traders 
at the Rashid, says that since the war began, business is down and 
prices are up. "The Rashid was moving 600 to 700 tonnes of tomatoes 
before the war, and now it's 400 to 450. Prices have gone up from 
an average of 275 dinars (nine cents) per kilo to 400 dinars (13 cents)," 
he says. The rise is largely due to the fact that the drivers have 
increased their prices five-fold, from 100,000 to 500,000 dinars (33 
to 155 dollars) a trip. Another trader, Daoud Suleiman, says the price 
of potatoes has meanwhile gone down a third after initially rising 
after the war began March 20. "There are too many on the market," 
he says. That's something Sadjaj Murteij would probably be proud to 
hear. "I can guarantee you one thing, Baghdad will never die of hunger. 
We're adventurers," Murteij says. "Sandstorms, war, bombing -- we 
deliver." sk/mc/bp/hc Iraq-war-food

Two of Japan's debt-ridden second-tier trading houses, Nissho Iwai 
and Nichimen, merged their operations Tuesday under a holding company 
with financial support from US investor Lehman Brothers. The holding 
company, Nissho Iwai-Nichimen Holdings Corp., vowed to accelerate 
restructuring efforts with its annual group pre-tax profit targeted 
at 101 billion yen (856 million dollars) in three years' time. "Our 
biggest mission is to achieve the numerical targets, which we have 
shown at home and abroad, as scheduled," Toru Hambayashi, who quit 
as Nichimen president to become the holding company's chairman, said 
in a statement. The holding company will also aim for a group net 
profit of 70 billion yen for the year to March 2006, compared with 
a combined net loss of 111 billion yen estimated for the year which 
ended on Monday. Five Japanese financial institutions and Lehman Brothers 
Holdings Inc. were in final negotiations to invest more than 260 billion 
yen in Nissho Iwai-Nichimen Holdings Corp. possibly in May, a business 
daily said on Monday. UFJ Bank, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Mitsubishi 
Tokyo Financial Group Inc., Resona Bank and Norinchukin Bank will 
acquire preferred shares to be issued by the holding company, the 
daily said. Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers plans to acquire five billion 
yen in preferred shares, in addition to the 10 billion yen in convertible 
bonds it will buy in the year to March 2004, the report said. This 
would mark the first time a foreign investor had participated in the 
restructuring of a Japanese trading house. sps/th Japan-trading-company

The general secretary of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party, Nong Duc 
Manh, will pay an official visit to China from April 7 to 11, China's 
foreign ministry said Tuesday. The visit comes at the invitation of 
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who is also general secretary of the 
Communist Party, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters 
at a regular briefing. "China hopes the visit will further promote 
Sino-Vietnamese relations," Liu said. Relations between China and 
Vietnam have maintained a good momentum over the past few years, Liu 
said. The two sides have settled their border issues and have maintained 
frequent exchanges of high-level visits, Liu said. Trade and economic 
cooperation is also recording new progress, he added. Ideological 
soulmates but historical rivals, China and Vietnam fought a brief 
but bloody war along their common border in 1979 following a Vietnamese 
invasion of Cambodia. They subsequently clashed over territorial claims 
in the South China Sea in 1988 and 1992. But the relationships between 
the two countries have improved significantly recently, with Vietnam 
congratulating China's new leadership last year. cs/rcw China-Vietnam-FM

A man with two hand grenades held an airliner with 46 people on board 
hostage at Havana's international airport and demanded that he be 
flown to Miami, officials said early Tuesday. The Soviet-made AN-24 
airliner had been en route from Nueva Gerona to Havana when the hijacker 
ordered the crew to head for Miami but they had to land at Jose Marti 
International Airport because the planehad insufficient fuel. It was 
refuelled at around 7:00 am (1100 GMT) The airliner remained parked 
on the tarmac, surrounded by police, as authorities "do their utmost 
to seek a solution that ensures the safety and lives of the passengers," 
the officials added. The hijacker aboard the plane threaten to detonate 
both his hand grenades if his demand to be flown to Miami is not met, 
they said. "The individual is at the back of the plane, apparently 
with two hand grenades, and he could possibly have some accomplices" 
on board, the statement added. All flights in and out of the airport 
have been canceled and inconvenienced passengers have been put up 
at hotels in Havana. The plane was hijacked Monday at around 9:30 
pm (0130 GMT Tuesday) after taking off from Nueva Gerona, on the Island 
of Youth some 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of the capital, the 
statement said. The airplane is carrying 40 adults, including the 
crew, and six children, the official statement said. "This act (of 
piracy) is the direct result of the encouragement US authorities have 
given hijackers with their incomprehensible behavior in the wake of 
the March 19 hijacking of a (Cuban) DC-3 airliner to the United States 
by six terrorists armed with knives," the Cuban official statement 
said. "The responsibility for what will happen (with Monday's hijacking) 
will fall entirely on the government" of the United States, the statement 
added. The Cuban statement referred to the March 19 hijacking to Florida 
of another Cuban airliner with 33 people on board after it also flew 
out of the Island of Youth. That plane was forced to land by US warplanes 
in Key West, Florida's southernmost island, where the hijackers were 
taken into custody. Eleven of the passengers sought political asylum 
in the United States; the rest returned to Cuba. A US judge later 
ruled that the six hijackers could be released on a 25,000 dollar 
bond pending trial, but the decision is being appealed. Cuban President 
Fidel Castro criticized the judge's decision and asked if the United 
States planned to put the six hijackers in a "gilded cage," wondering 
how their treatment would compare with the spartan conditions meted 
out to al-Qaeda and Taliban members confined at the US base in Guantanamo, 
Cuba. Cuba has also been critical of the US policy of granting asylum 
to any Cuban who manages to set foot on US soil -- like the 11 passengers 
on the March 19 flight. Those intercepted on the high seas are returned 
to the communist island. fgf/jlp/mac Cuba-plane

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Tuesday indicted two Islamic militants 
over a suicide bombing that killed 11 Frenchmen last year in the southern 
port city of Karachi, court officials said. Both defendants Asif Zaheer 
and Mohammed Bashir pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, use 
of explosives and conspiracy to murder. Zaheer, from the Harkat Jihad-ul 
Islami militant group and Bashir, of the outlawed Kashmiri militant 
organisation Harkatul Mujahedin, were asked to stand up before Judge 
Feroze Mahmood Bhatti read out the charges. "You both are charged 
that, with connivance of your other companions,...you hatched the 
conspiracy which killed 11 French engineers and technicians and two 
other persons," Bhatti said. The charges are punishable by death. 
Prosecutors told the court that they had eyewitness statements and 
confessions by the defendants to submit as proof of their involvement 
in the gruesome May 8 attack which also killed two Pakistanis and 
the suicide bomber. "We have confessions of the accused as well as 
statements of eye witnesses who saw the accused at the time of the 
incident," public prosecutor Maula Bux Bhatti said. "Police recovered 
explosive material from the two accused at the time of their arrest 
and the same material was used in the suicide bomb attack which establishes 
our case," he added. Both Zaheer and Bashir earlier told interogators 
they mistakenly thought their targets were Americans, and regretted 
that the victims turned out to be French who had been working on the 
Pakistan navy's Agosta 90-B submarine. The court in February declared 
five other militants absconders and in March ordered seizure of the 
property. The prosecutor said police had identified two of the five 
absconders as Adnan Qamar Noni and Sohail, but they were unaware of 
their current whereabouts. The judge adjourned the case until April 
3 when the court would listen to doctors who examined the victims' 
bodies and provided medical treatment to the injured. str/rj/bc/rcw

who designed the spectacular millennium firework display at Paris' 
towering monument, was to arrive in Athens on Tuesday to hammer out 
details. The project, provisionally budgeted at 600,000 euros (641,000

We will not be deflected from our planned growth by the conflict in 
Iraq," said Emirates' head of commercial operations Ghaith al-Ghaith. 
Services to Qatar will be increased to four daily by July, while extra 
flights to Kuwait and the eastern Saudi town of Dammam were introduced 
on March 30. Tehran will be served with four additional flights, subject 
to government approval, from May 3, and services to Muscat in neighbouring 
Oman will rise to a twice daily service with the introduction of seven 
more flights. Flights to the Yemeni capital Sanaa, meanwhile, will

SARAJEVO, April 1 (AFP) - NATO-led peacekeepers on Monday completed 
a four-day operation in Pale, the former stronghold of top fugitive 
warcrimes suspect Radovan Karadzic, where vehicles were being stopped 
and searched, a spokesman said Tuesday. The controls of vehicles in 
Pale were "consistent with normal operations conducted by SFOR" to 
ensure safety and security Dale MacEachern, a spokesman for NATO-led 
Stabilization Force (SFOR), told a press conference. NATO helicopters 
flew over the area during the operation. SFOR troops carried out two 
failed attempts in 2002 to arrest Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb 
leader, who is wanted by the United Nations tribunal in the Hague 
for war crimes and genocide allegedly committed during the 1992-95 
Bosnia war. The operation involved setting up checkpoints on all four 
roads leading out of Pale and searching almost all vehicles, MacEachern 
said. Earlier this month peacekeepers raided the Pale premises of 
two local businessmen known to provide financial assistance to Karadzic 
that has enabled him to evade arrest. anh-sar/zbl/jfs Bosnia-NATO-operation

Vandals have defaced one of the biggest British war cemeteries in 
northern France with graffiti condemning the US-British invasion of 
Iraq, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said Monday. Insults 
aimed at British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George 
W. Bush were sprayed in red paint over a monument to Britain's dead 
from World War I and discovered by a gardener last Thursday. "It was 
removed by the afternoon but not before a couple of coach loads (of 
visitors) had been through and seen it. We are pretty hacked off and 
I am pleased to say the French authorities are too," said Tim Reeves, 
the CWGC's representative in France. The words "Rosbifs (British) 
go home! Saddam Hussein will win and spill your blood" were painted 
in French over the base of the cemetery's main monument -- an obelisk 
topped by a cross. On one side was a swastika and the words "Death 
to the Yankees." Also daubed were the words: "Dig up your garbage. 
It is fouling our soil," and "Bush, Blair to the TPI (International 
Court of Justice)." Some 11,000 British dead are buried at Etaples, 
which lies on the Channel coast around 15 miles (24 kilometres) south 
of Boulogne. It was the site of several hospitals during the 1914-1918 
war. A judicial enquiry has been opened. "This violation of a burial 
place -- scandalous in itself -- is an attack on the memory of the 
sacrifice made by the British and American soldiers who contributed 
to the liberation of our soil," said the local member of parliament, 
former Socialist arts minister Jack Lang. "Our disagreement with the 
British and American governments (on Iraq) can in no way justify any 
assault on the memory of men who sacrificed themselves for our country," 
he said. hs/jfs Iraq-war-France-Britain

Six Islamic militants, a policeman and an activist of India's main 
opposition party were killed in separatist-related violence in Indian-administered 
Kashmir overnight, a police spokesman said Tuesday. He said Ghulam 
Mohammed Sheikh of the Congress party was shot dead at his home by 
suspected Muslim rebels in the Kreeri area of the northern Baramulla 
district late Monday. Sheikh is the second political activist to have 
been shot dead in the last two days in Baramulla, after a ruling Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) worker was shot dead by suspected rebels on 
Sunday. The PDP and Congress swept the long-ruling National Conference 
from power in state elections in September-October last year. Rebels 
have targeted activists of both parties since the polls. Meanwhile, 
Indian troops shot dead four militants in two gun battles in the southern 
district of Anantnag late Monday. Three of the four militants were 
killed in Kapran village, near Kulgam township, 70 kilometres (44 
miles) south of the summer capital Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding 
some arms and ammunition were also recovered. In another overnight 
gun battle two militants of dominant rebel group Hizbul Mujahedin 
and a policeman were killed in the village of Kulna Palmar in the 
southern Doda district, police said. Two more policemen were injured 
in the six-hour gun fight. Indian security forces say more than 38,000 
people have died in Kashmir since the eruption of anti-Indian rebellion 
in 1989, but separatists put the toll twice as high. Police also said 
three local militants surrendered to the police in different parts 
of Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region. str/an/th India-Kashmir-unrest

Russian oil giant LUKoil has had to delay the 1.375-billion-dollar 
(1.258-billion-euro) sale of its stake in a Caspian Sea oil field 
because of disagreements on how much tax it owes Azerbaijan's government 
on the deal, a LUKoil source told AFP Tuesday. LUKoil announced in 
December last year it was withdrawing from the consortium developing 
Azerbaijan's Azeri-Chiraq-Guneshli (ACG) offshore field and selling 
its 10 percent stake to the Tokyo-based company INPEX. But a LUKoil 
employee said negotiations over how much tax the Russian company should 
pay Azerbaijan were dragging on. The Azeri government must approve 
the sale before the deal can go through. "The Azeri government thinks 
LUKoil should pay 250 million dollars out of its profits from the 
sale," said the company employee, who was speaking on condition of 
anonymity. He said LUKoil Vice President Ravil Maganov was flying 
into Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, Tuesday for talks with Azeri officials. 
"I think all this will be resolved by the end of April," he added. 
LUKoil, Russia's biggest oil company in terms of output, is understood 
to need the cash from the ACG sale to fund major capital investments 
in oil projects elsewhere in the world. Pending the sale, the ACG 
field consortium comprises BP, which is also the operator, Azeri state 
oil company SOCAR, Statoil, LUKoil, Exxonmobil, Unocal, TPAO, Itochu 
Devon and Delta Hess. sab-clo/zak/hd Azerbaijan-Russia-oil-tax-company-LUKoil

Two US army helicopters flew small amounts of humanitarian aid into 
a captured airfield in central Iraq on Tuesday as an initial step 
to try to win over the local population and undermine Iraqi resistance, 
officers here said. The two Black Hawk helicopters delivered a total 
760 litres of bottled water and 580 ready-to-eat meals in what the 
pilots said they hoped would be the first of many such humanitarian 
flights. "We're just giving them food and water and hoping that our 
help wins over some of the Shiites," one of the pilots, Captain Eric 
Then, told AFP correspondents allowed on the flight. The focus on 
providing food, water and medical supplies in the wake of the invading 
US and British forces is designed to reinforce the Anglo-American 
message that their soldiers are attacking only the regime of Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein and want to help ordinary Iraqis. It also 
has a strategic value insofar as coalition commanders hope images 
of their men and women handing out humanitarian aid will cut down 
public support for Saddam's forces and deliver Iraqi towns and cities 
with the minimum of combat. "We are just waiting for one of the cities 
to fall and to start a domino effect," said Then. The two Black Hawks 
from the US 101st Airborne Division met no resistance as they landed 
at the one-strip airfield near Najaf which had been secured by the 
101st's ground forces late Monday. Farmland could be seen to the north 
of the facility, and two Iraqi farmers were sitting idly by their 
house just 150 metres (yards) from where the aircraft touched down. 
A blackened shell of a destroyed small Iraqi tank was also nearby. 
The pallets of rations of water were quickly unloaded on the ground 
and handed over to soldiers from the 101st who planned to distribute 
it. Najaf, 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of Baghdad, is, like much 
of southern Iraq, populated mainly by Shiite Muslims who have been 
generally oppressed by the Sunni Muslims who dominate Saddam's regime. 
But the US military's hopes of winning the support of civilians in 
the Najaf region were dealt a blow Monday when some US soldiers manning 
a checkpoint shot up a civilian vehicle that failed to stop on their 
command, killing at least seven women and children. kma/rmb/mb Iraq-war-aid-Najaf

up the outside of the world's biggest skyscrapers, scaled an office

it comes to Iraq I can see right from wrong," he said before his ascent 
of the 180-metre (600 foot) Elf tower in the Defense business district 
in the west of the capital. "We're dealing with a nutcase who thinks 
he speaks on behalf of the universe. He's an outlaw. It's easy to 
act like that when you are the most powerful nation in the world," 
he said of President George W. Bush. Robert has climbed around 50

Amnesty International on Tuesday criticised Myanmar's military government 
for its glacial pace of prisoner releases and a lack of other steps 
taken since its first-ever visit there in January. In a statement 
received here, the rights group said it welcomed some limited improvements 
in the human rights situation, but was disappointed other urgent steps 
have not yet been taken by the ruling State Peace and Development 
Council (SPDC) to improve the rights situation. "The SPDC has told 
the organisation that political prisoners now have access to reading 
materials and social contact, which are positive developments," the 
statement said. "However over 1,200 political prisoners are still 
held in prisons throughout the country, and the pace of releases has 
decreased considerably in the last four months... "During our visit, 
we submitted a number of lists of political prisoners, whose releases 
should be a first priority for the SPDC. Yet to our knowledge none 
of these people have been released," it added. The group also noted 
that arrests of people for their peaceful political activities began 
again in July last year. "Amnesty International has recently submitted 
a list of 27 such people to the SPDC, and is seeking further information 
about them." The junta has freed a few hundred prisoners in the last 
two years as goodwill gestures, but has failed to release any recently 
-- with the exception of a group of 45 people released a few days 
before a UN human rights envoy arrived there last month. The envoy, 
Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, cut his trip short after he discovered bugging 
equipment in a room where he was interviewing political prisoners. 
Amnesty visited Myanmar over January and February this year. Demelza 
Stubbings, Amnesty's interim program director for Asia-Pacific and 
head of the mission to Myanmar, said in Bangkok after the visit that 
Myanmar had shown some improvement in the human rights realm, particularly 
in the treatment of prisoners. "(But) much remains to be done, and 
we will continue to point out what it is," she said. The United States 
Tuesday also slammed the SPDC for its "extremely poor" rights performance 
in 2002. "The regime's human rights record remained extremely poor, 
and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses," the report said. 
Myanmar's junta has long been criticised for its poor human rights 
record, which rights groups and western governments have said includes 
forced labour, censorship and violations of religious freedom. sb/rcw

Seven people who smuggled 43 Chinese into South Korea were sentenced 
Tuesday to jail terms ranging from three to 14 years, state media 
reported. Liu Jie, Wang Zhihong and five others attempted to smuggle 
66 Chinese people into South Korea in March 2002, the Xinhua news 
agency said. Twenty-three of the people who were smuggled were captured 
by South Korean police. The human-smugglers made a total of one million 
yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) from the stowaways. The sentence was 
delivered by the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court. cs/th

Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said Tuesday he had extended his 
contract with the German club to 2005. Hitzfeld, 54, who has won the 
Champions League with both Borussia Dortmund and Bayern in the past 
six seasons, is believed to have had offers from several top sides 
- and has been touted in the past as a successor to Alex Ferguson 
at Manchester United. But Hitzfeld, Bayern coach since 1998, wants 
another shot at the Champions League with Bayern who failed to survive 
the first phase this season. Bayern currently have a mammoth 15-point 
lead over nearest rivals Dortmund as they chase their 18th league

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown on Tuesday named 
the current head of the country's energy regulator as the new chairman 
of finance watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Former 
senior banker Callum McCarthy begins what is one of the most important 
jobs in London's financial world in September, when incumbent Howard 
Davies steps down. Davies is leaving to become chairman of the London 
School of Economics, one of the best-known parts of the University 
of London. Brown said McCarthy would bring to the FSA "an unrivalled 
combination of experience of the public sector, experience as a senior 
practitioner in the financial services industry, and chairman of a 
highly successful regulator." McCarthy currently heads the Office 
of Gas and Electricity Markets, or Ofgem, which regulates Britain's 
privatised energy industry. As well as previously holding senior positions 
at Barclays Bank, BZW and Kleinwort Benson, McCarthy was formerly 
a top civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry. Under 
Davies's watch, the FSA became Britain's sole regulatory body for 
financial services in November 2001, taking on the various functions 
of nine separate agencies. pw/dr/hd Britain-economy-finance-executive

Sunderland midfielder Thomas Butler's season could be over after a 
scan revealed a tear in his calf muscle. The 21-year-old was forced 
to withdraw from the Republic of Ireland Under-21 squad last week 
with the problem, and now looks set to be sidelined for much of what 
is left of the season. Butler had only just returned from a niggling 
hamstring problem which had blighted his attempt to build on his emergence 
into the first team. He did not play at all under Peter Reid's successor 
Howard Wilkinson, and has appeared only once for new boss Mick McCarthy, 
the 2-0 defeat at West Ham last time out in which he picked up his 
injury. bur/rw03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-Sunderland

Singapore on Tuesday reported a fresh imported case of the killer 
respiratory virus and announced the closure of a polytechnic school 
after a student was suspected to have contracted the disease. The 
latest Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) index case involved 
a 56-year-old Chinese national who arrived from China's Fujian province 
near Guangdong on March 16 to visit her daughter, the Ministry of 
Health (MOH) said. "She became unwell on March 28 and was admitted 
to TTSH (Tan Tock Seng Hospital) as a suspect SARS case on March 29," 
the MOH said in a statement. The woman was "diagnosed as a SARS case," 
it said, adding home quarantine orders are being issued. The 20 year-old 
male student is the son of a 43-year-old Singaporean woman who died 
at the National University Hospital (NUH) on Monday from Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the mysterious virus that has claimed 
more than 60 lives and infected over 1,900 people globally. He had 
developed fever on March 27 and was admitted into the Communicable 
Disease Centre on March 30, the MOH said. "As he is the son of the 
patient who died of SARS at NUH on March 31, he was diagnosed as a 
suspect SARS case," it said. Education Minister Teo Chee Hean said 
at a press conference that Ngee Ann Polytechic, where the student 
is studying, would be closed for the rest of the week as a "precautionary 
measure." The closure involving 13,000 to 14,000 students will "give 
us time to assess the situation and to contact tracing," he said. 
Four people in Singapore have died from SARS in Singapore out of more 
than 90 cases reported so far. The city-state is among the worst hit 
in Asia and authorities have taken tough measures to contain the spread 
of the virus by closing schools up to the pre-universty level until 
April 6 and serving mandatory quarantine orders. Since last week, 
977 people in the city-state have been served quarantine orders. Of 
the 95 cases reported, 13 of them are still in serious condition, 
the ministry said. mba-bh/rcw Health-pneumonia-Singapore

Airlines worldwide are suffering from the double blow of war in Iraq 
and the global epidemic of a deadly pneumonia-like disease, the head 
of the World Tourism Organisation warned on Tuesday. The organisation's 
secretary general Francesco Frangialli was speaking as Dutch carrier 
KLM announced it would shed thousands of jobs as a result of the crisis 
facing the industry. "The main sector concerned is air travel, which 
is very seriously affected," Frangialli said. A longer-than-expected 
war in Iraq would postpone a recovery in the global tourism sector, 
he said, adding that the way the war had progressed so far "does not 
encourage optimism". Airlines had already cut thousands of jobs in 
the United States and more redundancies were in the pipeline, he said. 
KLM said in a statement it would cut "several thousand jobs" by speeding 
up restructuring plans, as a result of the Iraq conflict and alarm 
over the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the mystery 
strain of pneumonia that has now infected some 1,700 people and killed 
over 60 worldwide. The announcement came a day after the Association 
of European Airlines said the first week of conflict in Iraq had seen 
a 12.3-percent drop in passengers travelling with European carriers. 
European passenger traffic to the Middle East had dropped 42.2 percent, 
the AEA said, while intra-European routes saw a drop of 14.6 percent 
and transatlantic routes lost 10.2 percent. During the 1991 Gulf War, 
which lasted two months, the International Air Transport Association 
estimated that airlines lost around two billion dollars (1.84 billion 
euros) in revenues due to a 12-percent fall in passenger traffic in 
January and a 17-percent drop in February. Figures for the second 
week of the Iraq conflict were expected to be even worse, the AEA 
said, since they were also likely to be hit by the further spread 
of the SARS virus, thought to have originated in China before moving 
to Hong Kong. Asian airlines have had to reduce flights as passenger 
numbers plunged in the wake of the outbreak, with many companies cancelling 
staff travel to Hong Kong, Singapore and southern China. The economic 
crisis approaching global airlines raises the prospect that carriers 
all over the world may be forced to turn to their governments for 
more financial aid of the kind seen after the September 11, 2001 terror 
attacks, in order to fend off bankruptcy. Republican US Senators last 
week met to agree on proposals for a 2.8-billion-dollar package of 
aid to struggling US airlines. Washington may include the bail-out 
in a new budget to be submitted to Congress by President George W. 
Bush, the Wall Street Journal reported. Meanwhile, the Canadian government 
is preparing to issue up to 500 million Canadian dollars (341 million 
dollars, 313 million euros) in conditional loans to Air Canada, the 
heavily indebted national carrier, according to a report in the Toronto 
Star newspaper. European airlines have been quick to react to the 
news of foreign state aid. "If the war has clearly identifiable effects 
on costs -- security and insurance being those that spring to mind 
-- these should be met by governments, particularly in the light of 
the 2.8-billion-dollar aid plan being offered to American carriers," 
said AEA secretary general Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus. dd/lmf/vs Iraq-war-air-tourism-health-pneumonia-state-aid

The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), one of two Kurdish groups controlling 
northern Iraq, Tuesday accused Iraqi government forces of firing three 
missiles which missed its headquarters in the town of Salahaddin. 
"This is a grave development ... whose consequences will be borne 
by the Iraqi authorities," a spokesman said, adding that the KDP had 
refrained from taking any offensive action against Iraqi government 
forces since the US-led war was launched on March 20. The surface-to-surface 
missiles were fired at Salahaddin, some 20 kilometers (13 miles) north 
of the main Kurdish city of Arbil, early Monday but landed in open 
space on the outskirts of the hilltop town, leaving craters in the 
ground, according to footage aired by the KDP's satellite television, 
KTV. The KDP's military command for Arbil meanwhile claimed in a statement 
published in the Birayeti newspaper Tuesday that Iraqi authorities 
had stationed members of the paramilitary "Saddam's Fedayeen" in forward 
positions along the demarcation lines between government-held territory 
and KDP-controlled Arbil. Regular forces were sent to rear positions 
in a bid to prevent their "collapse" after some members defected to 
the Kurdish-held zone, the KDP command claimed. The KDP and other 
Iraqi opposition groups have alleged in recent days that a number 
of Iraqi officers and soldiers crossed into the Kurdish enclave, jointly 
controlled by the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), 
but that many others were "executed" for attempting to defect. Iraqi 
forces have made some tactical pullbacks along front lines with the 
Kurdish enclave, allowing the US-allied Kurdish fighters to advance 
to within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the strategic oil-rich city 
of Kirkuk. The Kurdish lines have been targetted by sporadic Iraqi 
rocket and mortar fire. str-dp/lg/bp/mb Iraq-war-Kurds-missiles

The United Nations' nuclear watchdog said on Tuesday it -- and not 
the United States -- was responsible for checking that Iraq did not 
possess any atomic weapons, after a report that Washington wanted 
to set up unilateral weapons inspections. "The IAEA is the sole body 
with legal authority to verify Iraq's nuclear disarmament," the head 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed ElBaradei 
said in a statement. "The world has learned over three decades that 
only through impartial, international inspections can credibility 
be generated. Iraq is no exception to that requirement." ElBaradei's 
comments came after the Washington Post said Washington had set up 
special military units to seek out the weapons of mass destruction 
it accuses Iraq of developing. "The Bush administration is determined 
to conduct the weapons hunt without the UN agencies that hold Security 
Council mandates for the job. Administration officials distrust the 
United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission 
(UNMOVIC) and the IAEA," the paper said, quoting "disarmament planners" 
who are also "negotiating contracts with private companies for some 
of the work". "White House officials have backed Defense Department 
efforts to create a substitute organization for UNMOVIC and the Vienna-based 
IAEA," the report continued, adding that the US State Department feared 
their moves would be opposed by other members of the UN Security Council. 
Hans Blix, the head of the UN inspection team responsible for verifying 
whether Iraq possesses any banned chemical and biological arms, said 
on Saturday that the US and London were trying to recruit his inspectors 
to work on a unilateral weapons search programme. "They have turned 
to some people who currently work for us and asked them to come down 
and help. These are our people who come from countries that are engaged 
in the conflict down there," Blix said. The inspection teams led by 
ElBaradei and Blix were evacuated from Iraq two days before the US-British 
invasion of Iraq, less than four months into the verification mission 
the United Nations Security Council had asked them to undertake. ElBaradei 
-- who on March 7 said UN experts had found no sign of any prohibited 
nuclear activity at any inspected site in Iraq -- said on Tuesday 
the weapons teams hoped to continue their work once the war was over. 
"The IAEA mandate in Iraq is still valid and has not changed," he 
said. "Our operation is interrupted because of hostilities. "We expect 
to go back with full authority after the cessation of hostilities, 
to resume our inspection activities in Iraq pursuant to the mandate 
given to us both by the Security Council and by the fact that Iraq 
is a party to the NPT (nuclear non-proliferation treaty). "Impartial 
and independent verification is at the core of international efforts 
over the last 30 years to underpin the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons," he continued, adding that IAEA inspectors had not yet been 
approached by Washington to work for the United States. Relations 
between Washington and the IAEA took a turn for the worse after ElBaradei 
told the Security Council on March 7 that documents allegedly proving 
that Iraq was seeking to procure uranium from Niger were forgeries. 
US Vice President Dick Cheney responded by saying that he thought 
ElBaradei was wrong in his conclusions. While IAEA inspectors were 
able to dismantle Iraq's secret nuclear weapons programme following 
the first Gulf war in 1991, US officials have pointed out that IAEA 
inspectors failed to uncover the Iraqi programme before the war. "We 
had made good progress since resuming inspections in Iraq in November 
and we stand ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume 
our work after the war and to provide the ongoing assurances sought 
by the Security Council that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme." 
The IAEA was for a long time one of the few UN agencies firmly supported 
by Washington, and one whose budget the US Congress did not attempt 
to cut. pmr/co/jfs Iraq-war-IAEA-US

Welsh Rugby Union struck a deal with the clubs Tuesday in a move that 
national coach Steve Hansen has called vital if the country is to 
improve its disastrous Test record. WRU chief David Moffett met the 
clubs on Tuesday to thrash out a deal to change from a nine-club to 
five-club structure next season. The deal allows Welsh clubs to play 
in next season's European Cup competitions. The clubs had been holding 
out for an extra 500,000 pounds after being offered 7,500,000 pounds. 
No financial details were announced. Cash-strapped Swansea have already 
gone into temporary administration this season, and other clubs would 
have followed if there was no move towards regional rugby. Moffett 
had said that if the domestic top-flight remained at nine clubs next 
season, then there would only have been 4.62 million pounds to share. 
The clubs had threatened not to release their international players 
for the June tour to Australia and New Zealand if an agreement could 
not be found. Hansen said after Wales suffered a Six Nations Championship 
whitewash at Paris on Saturday a weak club competition undermined 
efforts to improve on the Test level. "We have a weak club competition 
that doesn't make for a winning culture," he said. bur/rw03 Rugbyu-WAL

NEAR NAJAF, Iraq, April 1 (AFP) - US troops killed seven women and 
children when they opened fire on a civilian vehicle at a military 
checkpoint, in a severe blow for coalition efforts to win the trust 
of the Iraqi people. The shooting occurred at a checkpoint manned 
by soldiers from the US Army's Third Infantry Division at Najaf, 150 
kilometers (95 miles) south of Baghdad, on Monday afternoon, US spokesman 
Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Owens said. He said the victims 
were in a vehicle that failed to stop despite hand signals and repeated 
warning shots fired by US troops, who then fired at the passenger 
compartment as a last resort. Citing officers on the scene, the Washington 
Post said the civilians were killed by 25mm gunfire, with one man 
-- apparently the driver -- so badly injured he was not expected to 
live. US forces in Iraq have been on a heightened state of alert and 
are approaching Iraqi civilians with much greater caution following 
a suicide car bombing near Najaf on Saturday that killed four soldiers. 
Well before Saturday's car bomb, US officers had been making no secret 
of their outrage at the guerrilla tactics they said had been practiced 
by Iraqi forces -- firing from civilian vehicles, faking surrenders 
only to open fire, fighting behind human shields. Troops on the ground 
have also been frustrated -- and surprised -- by Iraqi forces they 
say don civilian clothes and then melt into the general population, 
making it near impossible to distinguish friend from foe. Reacting 
to Monday's shooting, Major General Buford Blount, commander of Third 
Infantry Division, said Tuesday his troops were "very concerned about 
it and very sorry that it happened." But he stressed that with US 
soldiers on edge after the suicide car bomb attack, the unit that 
opened fire on the minibus had respected its rules of engagement. 
A written statement issued by US Central Command here early Tuesday 
said initial reports of the checkpoint shooting "indicate the soldiers 
responded in accordance with the rules of engagement to protect themselves". 
"In light of recent terrorist attacks by the Iraqi regime, the soldiers 
exercised considerable restraint to avoid the unnecessary loss of 
life." Central Command spokesman James Wilkinson later described the 
shooting as an "unfortunate tragedy" and acknowledged that young US 
soldiers could well be "a little jumpy" in the aftermath of the suicide 
bombing. "While it is a tragedy and we certainly grieve for the loss 
of the innocent," he told a BBC interviewer, "it does point out the 
tactics that this regime is going to use. "In instances like this, 
the fault lies with the regime." US Brigadier General Vincent Brooks 
told a press briefing Tuesday at Central Command's forward planning 
base in Qatar, "While we regret the loss of civilian lives ... they 
remain unavoidable as they have been throughout history." "Our efforts 
may result in the loss of civilian lives and they clearly will result 
in the loss of Iraqi military lives," he also said when asked if the 
checkpoint shooting would affect the coalition's efforts to win "the 
hearts and minds" of the people of Iraq. As civilian casualties mount 
in Baghdad, where US and British forces are carrying out day and night 
air strikes, the checkpoint shooting was a further blow to a US public 
relations campaign that seeks to portray coalition troops as liberators 
and providers rather than invaders and occupiers. US newspapers warned 
of the negative fallout from the killings on public opinion in Iraq 
as well as the Middle East at large, and said such incidents play 
into the hands of President Saddam Hussein's regime. The balancing 
act for military commanders to minimize civilian casualties while 
putting down Iraqi resistance is "clearly growing harder," the Washington 
Post said. "Even if accidental, such events, like the deaths of civilians 
in Baghdad attributed to errant US bombs, can incur large political 
costs both in and outside Iraq," the Post said. The New York Times 
said that "billions around the globe are seeing and hearing reports 
that women and children were gunned down yesterday ... "This is just 
what the Iraqi commanders have in mind when they send soldiers disguised 
as non-combatants to fire on unsuspecting American troops," the paper 
said. "If such scenes become routine ... , the political war for Iraq 
could be lost even before the military one is won," warned the Times. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), meanwhile, said 
it regretted the shooting and hoped US troops made sure that the driver 
of the minibus, had been adequately warned. "We hope that they took 
all the necessary measures to warn the people, to clearly alert them," 
Antonella Notari, an ICRC spokeswoman in Geneva, told reporters. "Checkpoints 
have, of course, the right to try and defend their own security and 
the security of their personnel so they may search vans, they may 
stop vehicles, there are certain rules on how you proceed in that," 
she said. "I can't comment on what exactly happened on the spot, I 
can only deeply regret that again they were civilians who were hit," 
she added. nh-lc/bur/hc/mb Iraq-war-US-checkpoint Iraq-war-US-checkpoint

Clean water has returned to this town on Iraq's southern tip controlled 
by the US-led coalition, but distribution has been chaotic, leaving 
some of the 40,000 residents still dry. Before the start of the war 
March 20, Umm Qasr received water from Basra to the north, which has 
been besieged for a week by coalition troops. On Monday, drinking 
water started coming through a pipe from across the border in Kuwait. 
"The water is there but it's poorly distributed," Mohammed Maizar 
al-Ansari, director of Umm Qasr's hospital, told AFP. Some 2.7 million 
liters (610,000 gallons) of water, in theory enough to meet immediate 
needs, are supposed to reach Umm Qasr each day through tankers supervised 
by British soldiers. The trucks head to different districts across 
Umm Qasr, but they are often forcibly stopped by residents who want 
their water first. "It's the strongest who gets the last word," said 
Ansari, who suspected that "some of the drivers are trying to resell 
water which they are supposed to be distributing for free." He said 
the hospital went without water Tuesday, as it had already used all 
the 1,000 liters (227 gallons) it received Monday. Ansari said he 
informed the British military command about the problem but he has 
not yet heard a response. A British officer played down the problems, 
saying that the first day saw some glitches. On the first day only 
half a million liters (114,000 gallons) went through the 2.5-kilometer 
(1.5-mile) pipeline from Kuwait, said Paul Stanley, who is in charge 
of civilian protection services for the British army. "More than two 
million liters (454,000 gallons) should have arrived in Umm Qasr, 
but we had some technical problems," he told AFP. For Ansari, the 
hospital director, the solution is to avoid tankers altogether. "The 
water coming from Kuwait could be put into the city reservoir and 
distributed by Umm Qasr's normal network," he said. The water would 
therefore be rationed, and the supply could be restricted to only 
a couple of hours a day. he said. Umm Qasr, where in Ansari's estimate 
some 10,000 displaced Iraqis are living, is at least better off than 
some other towns in southern Iraq. North of here, on the road connecting 
Al-Zubair and Basra, Iraqis have been heading to a pond created by 
spills from a pipe supplying water to a petrochemical plant. "We're 
using this for our homes because we don't have water," said one young 
woman from Al-Zubair. "Only one tanker distributed water Monday, but 
that wasn't enough." Aid agencies have warned of the dangers of life-threatening 
diseases if safe drinking water supplies are not restored. sn/tm/sct/bp/hc

A group of 20 battle-weary South African human shields returned from 
Baghdad on Tuesday, declaring that the Iraqi people do not want to 
be "liberated". Abie Dawjee, the leader of the group called the Iraqi 
Action Committee, said every Iraqi he had spoken to was passionate 
about fighting the invaders. "We spoke freely to Iraqis from all walks 
of life, in the streets, in hospitals, in country areas and in houses, 
and without exception the message was the same: the invaders must 
get out, we do not want you to liberate us," Dawjee told reporters 
at Johannesburg International Airport. Asked about the perception 
of Iraqi civilans toward President Saddam Hussein, Dawjee said the 
strong resistance against the coalition forces reflected the anger 
of the Iraqi people over what had been done to them since the first 
Gulf war in 1991. "The indiscriminate bombing in the first Gulf war 
that destroyed so many civilan targets, the US-led sanctions that 
have lead to the deaths of 1.3 million Iraqis and the dropping of 
depleted-uranium bombs in the final days of the last war which gave 
so many Iraqis cancer, have caused tremendous anger." Thirty-two South 
African shields arrived in Iraq shortly before the first bombing of 
Baghdad on March 19. Eight arrived home last week, while four others 
are assisting at a refugee border camp in Jordan. A number of the 
shields cried and embraced as Dawjee recounted the events of the past 
12 days. "When we got there we plugged into the other human shield 
groups that were already operating. We shielded a water purification 
plant, an oil refinery and a water treatment plant," Dawjee said. 
He said Iraqi civilians often visited the human shields and brought 
them gifts and food. "We even went into some of their houses. They 
were very appreciative of us being there, especially of our South 
African contingent which was by far the largest from any country. 
"We were staying in prefab houses at the sites and when the bombs 
dropped the houses would shake and rattle, it was unbelievably frightening. 
I can only imagine how the Iraqi families were feeling." The group 
had visited a residential area where five homes had been flattened 
by bombs. They had also been to a hospital where they saw the broken 
bodies of little children. One of the woman shields, Ridwana Jooma, 
said the worst part of being in Iraq was leaving. "Every breath you 
take might be your last, because you never know when a missile might 
go astray," she said. "By being there I learned the gift of life. 
I did not want to come home." srg/hn/nb Iraq-war-SAfrica-shields

The volume of orders placed with companies in Germany's manufacturing 
sector rose by 4.1 percent in January from the figure for December, 
final data published by the Bundesbank on Tuesday showed. Manufacturing 
orders therefore showed a stronger increase than the 3.8 percent originally 
estimated on March 21 by the Economy and Labour Ministry in Berlin. 
The sharp increase in January orders therefore offsets the 4.0-percent 
slump in activity recorded in December from the previous month. Last 
week the Bundesbank revised sharply upwards German industrial output 
data for January. spm/vs Germany-economy-manufacturing-orders

Thousands of Pakistani tribesmen are standing by to fight US and British 
forces in Iraq, leaders from the country's northwestern tribal region 
said Tuesday. "Government should make arrangements for 10,000 volunteers 
of this area to take part in jihad (holy war) against US forces in 
Iraq," Maulana Mohammad Zaman, a religious leader of the Skhakot tribal 
region bordering Afghanistan, told a crowd of some 500 people. The 
volunteers' programme was unveiled as demonstrations continued in 
various cities of Pakistan against the US-British invasion of oil-rich 
Muslim country. Pakistan's foreign office has said the government 
would not help volunteers travel to Iraq, but similar demands were 
made at two other rallies in the semi-autonomous region. The fundamentalist 
Jamaat Ahle Sunnat party said it would organise a convoy of protesters 
to travel 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) from Rawalpindi near here to 
the southern port city of Karachi on trucks and buses. Organisers 
said they would start the three-day journey, designed to stoke anti-war 
feeling, on Thursday. Around 3,000 people turned up at a rally called 
by the secular Awami National party in the northwestern city of Peshawar. 
Speakers chanted anti-US slogans and urged France, China, Russia and 
Germany to take effective measures to stop the war in Iraq. strs-rj/jhd/th

In the wake of the war on Iraq, the Arab League "can no longer go 
on in its current shape", the secretary general of the 22-member body, 
Amr Mussa, said in an interview published Tuesday. "The Arabs are 
in a situation of extreme weakness, above all at this historic time," 
Mussa told the Arabic-language daily Asharq Al Awsat, published in 
London and printed in a dozen Arab-speaking nations. "Some Arab states 
wanted the war, there are some which made preparations for it and 
foresaw a certain outcome," Mussa said, without being specific which 
countries he had in mind. "But the tough Iraqi resistance to aggression 
has upset these calculations," he said. "The Arab League can no longer 
go on in its current shape and the whole system has to be reviewed." 
Mussa told the paper, however, that this debate could not take place 
while the US-led war against Iraq was under way. "Whether the Arab 
League continues or ceases to exist doesn't interest me," he said. 
"I'm interested, rather, ... by the strategic interests of the Arab 
states." aff-atl/nb/mb Iraq-war-ArabLeague-Mussa

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw warned Tuesday that as US and 
British troops advance on Baghdad they will face fierce resistance 
and could experience setbacks. "There may be more setbacks for coalition 
troops," Straw said in a speech to the Newspaper Society annual conference. 
"As the regime enters its final stages, we will encounter fierce resistance 
from those elements of the regime's apparatus of terror whose fate 
is tied to their tyrannical ruler," Straw said. Straw said Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein had to be removed from power as he was a "scar on the 
conscience of the world." "We will rid the world of a brutal dictator, 
and, in doing so, ensure that the long-suffering Iraqi people will 
emerge from the shadow of dictatorship into the light of freedom," 
Straw said. He said the in the post-Saddam period, turning Iraq into 
a well-off, democratic nation would take "years." Straw said a UN-led 
conference might be needed to bring together Iraq's ethnic and religious 
groups -- its Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis -- to form a new state after 
the war. Straw said it was "increasingly probable" that Iraq was behind 
the attack on a civilian target in Baghdad last month. "It's increasingly 
probable that this was the result of Iraqi, not coalition action," 
Straw said. He was apparently referring to an attack on March 26 in 
Baghdad in which 14 civilians were killed and around 30 wounded as 
two missiles fell in a working-class market district. He warned people 
against making "snap judgments on the basis of television pictures." 
Straw said a factor making people oppose the war may be that unlike 
Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic, "Saddam Hussein has conducted 
his reign of terror off-camera. So unlike Kosovo, Iraq has not pricked 
the world's conscience through our televisions screens. "Saddam has 
waged a war, but a hidden one, against the Iraqi people. "There are 
no TV cameras in Saddam's torture chambers or in the darkest corners 
of Baghdad. But the suffering and oppression are real. "Until his 
long reign of terror is ended, Saddam Hussein will remain a standing 
affront to the ideals which underpin the foreign policies of the UK, 
the United States and our European allies," Straw said. Concerning 
the market bombing, British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon has said 
the attack may have been caused by the Iraqi military. "Although investigations 
continue into this tragic incident, it could clearly have been caused 
by fallout from the regime's anti-aircraft fire or the failure of 
one of the regime's own missiles," Hoon said. Baghdad has said allied 
fire was responsible. The United States acknowledged it might have 
killed some civilians with air strikes. A statement by the US Central 
Command said coalition warplanes used precision-guided weapons to 
attack nine Iraqi surface-to-surface missiles and launchers that were 
placed in a residential neighborhood of Baghdad. "Most of the missiles 
were positioned less than 300 feet (90 meters) from homes," said the 
statement. It made no direct mention of deaths in the text, but the 
headline read: "Civilian damage possible." msa/ial/jfs Iraq-war-Britain-Straw

Aston Villa have been told they will not face any charges from the 
Football Association following crowd problems during their derby against 
Birmingham last month. There were four pitch invasions and one home 
fan ran the length of the Villa Park pitch to confront Birmingham 
midfielder Robbie Savage. But Villa said Tuesday the FA had praised 
them for the way they handled the trouble and because of their previous 
good record would not be charged. Hoever, both Villa and Birmingham 
have been charged with failing to control their players. Villa striker 
Dion Dublin and Birmingham striker Christophe Dugarry have also been 
charged with misconduct. bur/rw03 Fbl-ENG-Pr-Villa
