 international  community  all  eligible  progress  achieved  by  the 
 Chinese  government  to  strengthen  the  rule  of  law  throughout 
 the  country.  At  the  same  time,  the  Chinese  government  has 
 made  significant  efforts  to  ensure  equal  rights  of  ethnic 
 minorities,  which  already  have  the  right  to.  Moreover,  the 
 Chinese  authorities  have  supported  its  efforts  to  combat  poverty

 Mr.  Bayer,  the  Hungarian  Ambassador  :  Change  the  situation

 the  Chinese  law  has  witnessed  remarkable  growth  in  terms 
 of  quantity  and  quality.  During  the  quarter-century  since 
 the  end  of  the  Cultural  Revolution,  began  the  People's  Republic 
 of  China  in  terms  of  the  most  well-coordinated  effort  individual 
 national  legal  development  in  the  history  of  China.  The  results 
 were  impressive  and  returned  would  benefit  the  Chinese  society 
 as  a  whole.  Hungary  monitors  efforts  Chinese  great  sympathy 
 is  ready  to  provide  its  experience  gained  during  the  past 
 decade  during  the  transition  to  democracy  and  the  rule  of 
 law  and  a  market  economy.  The  recent  history  of  China,  Hungary, 
 traditional  friends  and  the  challenges  that  they  had  to  be 
 overcome  in  the  past  many  common  features.  That  is  why  State 
 began  a  dialogue  on  human  rights  in  2000.  We  believe  that 
 the  open  and  constructive  exchanges  of  views  on  human  rights 
 issues  with  China  to  benefit  the  two  sides.  Experience  has 
 shown  that  the  Hungarian  market  economy  is  acting  as  well 
 and  the  rule  of  law  are  linked  closely  connected  to  their 
 respective  market  mechanisms  can  only  operate  in  a  climate 
 of  systematic  legal  reliable.  I  am  convinced  that  China  on 
 track  towards  full  implementation  of  these  ideas,  even  if 
 they  were  quite  different  historical  and  cultural  background 
 of  the  background  of  Hungary.  Mr.  a  ambassador,  ambassador 
 of  Indonesia  :  With  most  developing  countries  to  make  progress

 They  are  free  to  travel  to  any  place  Liberals  to  prefer

 in  the  country.  Mr.  Jose  be,  Mexican  minister  :  China  and 
 Mexico  to  take  the  same  situation  with  regard  to  the  subject 
 construction  to  explore  further  ways  and  means  of  cooperation 
 in  the  payment  of  positive  support  human  rights  forward. 
 In  September  of  2001,  visited  the  vice-minister  of  human 
 rights  Mexican  Acosta  China  very  fruitful  and  a  series  of 
 meetings  with  Chinese  organizations  in  China  on  human  rights. 
 To  move  forward  in  making  this  dialogue  a  priority  for  us. 
 During  the  visit,  expressed  his  admiration  for  the  Mexican 
 side  of  the  great  progress  achieved  by  China  in  the  protection 
 of  the  right  to  subsistence  and  development  and  promotion 
 and  protection  of  ethnic  minorities  ad  hoc  effective  ways 
 to  grant  them  self-government  at  different  levels  of  self-rule, 
 as  well  as  broad  religious  freedom.  On  the  other  hand,  it 
 is  important  to  note  that  the  two  countries,  as  two,  adopt 
 the  same  position  and  that  there  should  be  human  rights 
 as  a  pretext  to  interfere  in  internal  affairs  of  any  country. 
 We  are  fully  aware  of  the  efforts  to  build  a  society  pleasant

 by  the  National  Conference  of  the  Group  of  16  of  the  Communist

 world  according  to  the  agency  Syrian  Arab  children.  In  view 
 of  statements  made  by  some  American  officials  on  the  provision 
 of  Syria,  Iraq's  military  assistance  to  any  mere  accusations 
 unfounded  allegations,  which  in  essence,  merely  mask  the  failure 
 of  the  U.S.  and  British  forces  in  achieving  their  objectives 
 of  occupation  and  domination  thanks  to  the  steadfastness  of 
 the  people  of  Iraq  and  sacrifices.  It  is  noteworthy  that 
 Syria  had  been  addressed  to  the  recent  accusations  by  the 
 Minister  of  Defence  Donald  Rumsfeld  and  minister  for  foreign 
 affairs  relating  to  the  American  Secretary  of  State  Colin 
 Powell  to  send  military  equipment  to  Iraq  in  Syria  that 
 Damascus  officially  denied  and  viewed  it  as  unfounded  allegations.

 the  rich  and  powerful  Arab  state.  Muslin  pointed  out  that 
 he  was  speaking  to  reporters  today  that  the  accounts  Anglo-American 
 Muslims  have  been  erratic  since  it  started  with  the  platform 
 for  flimsy  is  that  this  war  will  be  brief  and  that  the 
 Iraqi  people  will  receive  nor  easy  and  cooperate  with  invading 
 forces,  contrary  to  what  is  happening  now  to  address  all 
 segments  of  the  people  of  Iraq,  where  violent  resistance

 war  against  Iraq  that  the  world,  including  the  Middle  East 
 would  be  restructured  in  accordance  with  the  new  strategy 
 of  America.  The  road  map  to  Muslin  confirmed  that  a  programme 
 for  the  implementation  of  the  vision  of  the  US  President 
 George  W.  Bush  to  solve  the  problem  of  the  conflict  in 
 the  Middle  East  has  been  prepared  to  implement  the  three 
 major  phases  and  end  the  violence  and  establish  a  temporary 
 Palestinian  state  and  the  holding  of  Palestinian  reforms  and 
 negotiations  on  issues  of  final  settlement.  Muslin  said  that 
 the  first  stage  of  the  plan  had  been  overtaken  by  events 
 today  developments  in  the  war  on  Iraq  and  pressure  Israel

 ground,  prolonging  the  transitional  phase,  which  was  to  be

 put  an  end  to  the  Israeli  occupation  of  the  territories 
 it  occupied  in  1967,  and  to  withdraw  its  forces  to  positions 
 prior  to  the  intifada  and  stop  building  settlements  and  to 
 provide  financial  assistance  to  the  Palestinians,  it  is  to 
 undergo  many  negative  public  condition  and  lack  of  a  mechanism 
 and  timetable  for  implementation  of  the  total  elimination

 and  Israeli  obligations  corresponding  obligations.  On  the  other 
 hand,  criticized  the  Muslin  informal  nature  of  the  control 
 of  the  quadripartite  committee  in  the  implementation  of  the 
 international  road  map.  He  also  expressed  his  belief  that 
 it  would  be  better  for  the  Security  Council  to  take  a  decision 
 made  it  clear  steps  to  control  and  enforcement  tools  alarm 
 that  unfortunately  there  has  been  a  substantial  reduction 
 in  the  course  of  the  peace  process  and  the  settlement  of 
 the  settlement,  which  has  made  great  strides  in  the  framework 
 of  the  Camp  David  and  Taba  negotiations,  which  has  made 
 great  strides  towards  a  settlement  and  then  come  after  the 
 end  of  a  road  map  is  to  return  since.  Muslin  stressed  that

 or  non-military  action  in  accordance  with  Chapter  VII  of 
 the  Charter  of  the  United  Nations."  In  response  to  a  question 
 on  American  insistence  on  the  resolution  No.  1441  issued 
 by  the  Security  Council  to  provide  legal  cover  for  military 
 operations  against  Iraq,  he  said  for  the  word  forensic  cover

 use  of  force  ",  he  said,  pointing  out  that  the  United  States 
 had  tried  to  exploit  the  resolution  Iraq  did  not  respect 
 this  resolution  and  thus  they  use  force  to  impose  respect 
 for  Iraq  and  the  prestige  of  the  United  Nations  this  fact 
 absolutely  avoid  that,  according  to  determine  whether  Iraq 
 has  respect  for  the  resolution  of  the  United  States  is  not 
 whether  or  not  is  the  Security  Council.  "  In  response  to

 the  steadfastness  of  the  Iraqi  resistance  is  the  emergence 
 of  new  forces  to  enable  the  Security  Council  Resolutions 
 of  the  actors  ".  He  added  that  recourse  to  the  Security 
 Council  in  this  case  active  substance  because  we  have  good, 
 but  must  be  used  in  the  five  permanent  members  and  there 
 is  an  important  advantage  is  that  the  United  States  and 
 Britain  may  not  have  the  veto  (veto)  because  of  the  Parties 
 to  the  conflict  and,  therefore,  does  not  have  to  be  against 
 judge  at  the  same  case.  "  It  was  for  the  "that  the  non-permanent 
 members  of  the  Security  Council  to  cooperate  with  the  three 
 states  permanent  members  (China,  Russia,  France)  to  reach 
 an  acceptable  formulation  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  current 
 situation  and  ensure  the  consensus  of  the  rest  of  the  member 
 states."  In  response  to  a  question  about  his  vision  of  mutual 
 accusations  between  the  two  American  and  Iraqi  violation  of 
 international  conventions  on  treatment  of  prisoners,  he  said 
 for  the  behaviour  of  the  United  States  towards  the  Iraqi 
 prisoners  of  war  is  a  real  violation  of  international  conventions, 
 in  addition  to  the  U.S.  and  British  forces  to  collect  Iraqi 
 citizens  were  not  involved  in  the  fighting  on  the  grounds 
 that  they  are  prisoners  of  war  who  were  to  be  released 
 immediately.  "  It  was  for  "with  regard  to  the  charges  to 
 Iraq  was  introduced  by  the  Americans  captured  images  to  the 
 media  is  not  correct  because  Iraq  reassure  these  pictures 
 published  by  the  United  States  on  the  lives  of  prisoners 
 to  him."  In  response  to  a  question  about  whether  the  planners 
 of  war  could  be  brought  to  trial  before  international  tribunals, 
 he  said  for  the  exercise  by  the  United  States  and  Britain 
 against  the  Iraqi  people  is  clear  acts  of  genocide,  which 
 establishes  British  political  leaders  who  caused  this  war
