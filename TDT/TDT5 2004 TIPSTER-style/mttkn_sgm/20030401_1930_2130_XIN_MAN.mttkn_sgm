 Roundup:  attracted  the  attention  of  various  parties  Powell's 
 visit  to  Turkey  Xinhua  reporter  Wang  Qiang  The  United  States 
 launched  a  war  in  Iraq  entered  a  critical  stage,  US  Secretary 
 of  State  Colin  Powell  arrived  in  northern  Iraq  late  on  April 
 1  visit  to  Turkey.  The  move  was  immediately  attracted  the 
 attention  of  various  parties.  Powell  to  visit  the  former, 
 Erdogan  Turkish  new  prime  minister  convened  a  high-ranking 
 officials,  foreign  minister  and  army  chief  of  staff  to  attend 
 the  meeting.  In  accordance  with  the  arrangement,  Powell  will 
 meet  on  September  2,  the  Turkish  foreign  minister  and  army 
 chief  of  staff  Heuse  Kirk.  Turkish  President  Sezer  and  Prime 
 Minister  Erdogan  will  also  meet  with  Powell.  According  to 
 media  reports,  Turkish  side  intend  to  fully  use  this  opportunity 
 to  the  US  side  to  the  explanation  that  March  Turkish  Grand 
 National  Assembly  has  not  ratified  the  first  US  military 
 presence  in  Turkey  to  open  up  "the  northern  front"  Parliament 
 is  the  democratic  decision-making,  and  the  United  States  and 
 its  subsequent  to  the  Turkish  political  and  media  speculation 
 and  accusations  were  unfounded.  In  addition,  the  Turkish  side 
 is  ready  to  Powell  expressed  concern  about  the  situation 
 in  northern  Iraq,  reaffirming  that  Turkey  sent  troops  into 
 northern  Iraq  intended  to  contain  no  territorial  ambitions. 
 Powell's  visit  to  the  US  side  also  attached  great  importance 
 to  Turkey.  In  the  Turkish-based  open  war  against  Iraq  "northern 
 front"  after  the  abortion  of  the  programme,  the  government 
 of  the  United  States  very  dissatisfied  with  the  Turkish  side. 
 The  US  media  accused  Turkish  eyes  only  "money  buy  Road" 
 and  in  total  disregard  traditional  relations  between  Turkey 
 and  the  United  States.  Some  Turkish  detract  from  the  US 
 political  cartoons  press  reproduced  in  the  territories  has 
 caused  strong  protest  against  the  Turkish  side.  Analysts  believe 
 that  Powell's  visit  to  a  3:1  rehabilitation  through  visits 
 and  friendly  relations  with  Turkey,  the  Turkish  side  feared 
 that  there  is  no  Iraqi  refugees  in  northern  Iraq  and  Kurdish 
 factional  fighting  for  independence  did  not  take  advantage 
 of  the  attempt  to  take  an  effort  to  persuade  Turkey  to 
 abandon  plans  to  send  troops  to  northern  Iraq,  Iraq  discuss 
 post-war  and  American-Turkish  collaboration.  Analysts  pointed 
 out  that  Powell's  visit  to  the  Earth  Summit  Agenda,  are 
 likely  to  include  Turkey  in  a  more  positive  way  to  support 
 the  US  war  against  Iraq.  Both  U.S.  territories  while  the 
 United  States  does  not  recognize  the  Turkish  military  cooperation 
 on  the  new  demands,  but  when  US  and  British  forces  in  southern 
 Iraq  was  not  smooth  progress  against  the  backdrop  of  war, 
 the  United  States  hopes  to  strengthen  military  cooperation 
 with  Turkey.  Analysts  pointed  out  that  the  US  military  airbase 
 is  anxious  to  use  the  territories  in  the  United  States  warplanes 
 taking  off  and  landing  recent  attacks  on  Iraq,  which  could 
 increase  the  frequency  and  intensity  air  strikes  against  Iraq. 
 Powell's  visit  to  Turkey  was  also  concerned  about  the  government 
 of  Iraq.  Iraqi  Foreign  Minister  Sabri  recently  in  Baghdad 
 accepted  Turkish  press,  expressed  the  hope  that  we  should 
 not  be  too  dependent  on  Turkey  to  the  United  States.  Sabri 
 notes  that  the  1991  Gulf  war  the  international  community 
 sanctions  against  Iraq  to  Turkey  equally  significant  losses. 
 Analysts  pointed  out  that,  in  efforts  to  maintain  relations 
 with  US  allies  and  the  National  Anti-war  sentiment  of  the 
 conflict,  the  Turkish  government  did  have  some  dilemma.

 public  construction  projects  has  significantly  reduced  government 
 spending.  In  addition,  analysts  also  said  that  although  the 
 United  States  February  construction  spending  declined,  they

 has  again  become  the  Gulf  War  the  arms  industry  advertising 
 money  from  the  scene.  An  analysis  by  experts  here  said  that 
 the  United  States  in  this  high-tech  arms  "advertising  war 
 ",  comparatively  low  prices,  such  as  precision-guided  weapons 
 expected  to  become  a  big  winner.  The  Iraqi  war  media  war 
 has  created  a  new  history.  The  US  Cable  News  Network  (CNN), 
 live,  for  us  all  very  high  exposure  to  new  weapons.  "Washington 
 Post"  in  the  first  report  quoting  American  Federation  of 
 scientists  and  experts  Bernich  arms  sales,  arms  manufacturers 
 have  to,  CNN  called  the  most  ideal  "marketing  tools  ".  Vice-Chairman 
 of  the  Aerospace  Industries  Association  of  America  Johnson, 
 a  weapons  development  and  testing  after  many  years,  only 
 in  "fighting  hard  and  difficult"  to  truly  reflect  the  value. 
 The  US  defense  experts  consulted,  McCully  also  pointed  out 
 that  has  withstood  the  test  combat  weapons  systems  than  those 
 who  had  never  used  in  war  weapons  sales  could  be  more  than 
 three  times.  The  US  arms  dealers,  war  means  not  only  large 
 domestic  orders,  but  also  stimulate  export  performance.  According 
 to  statistics,  the  last  after  the  Gulf  War,  the  United  States 
 arms  enterprises  signed  contracts  with  other  countries  what 
 amount  almost  doubled,  from  sharp  US  $11  billion  in  1991 
 rose  to  20  billion  US  dollars  in  1993.  The  Iraqi  war  broke 
 out  over  10  days,  what  the  market  potential  displayed  weapons 
 experts  in  the  light  tanks,  warplanes,  global  market  has 
 basically  saturated,  the  war  on  the  expensive  weapons  will 
 be  particularly  evident  in  the  market.  At  present,  overseas 
 buyers  most  interested  in  the  precision-guided  and  other  high-tech 
 weapons.  During  the  1991  Gulf  War,  the  US  military  equipment 
 of  bombs  and  missiles  were  used  only  10%  of  precision  control 
 technology.  In  the  war  in  Iraq,  the  percentage  increased 
 to  90%.  The  United  States  launched  the  first  24  hours  more 
 than  500  precision-guided  missiles  "Tomahawk"  cruise-missile 
 missiles  worth  about  $600,000  each.  The  US  has  also  been 
 used  more  precision-guided  bombs.  Their  relative  is  not  too 
 expensive  for  procurement  of  arms  has  aroused  the  attention 
 of  businessmen.  For  example,  Boeing's  production  of  the  "Joint 
 Direct  Attack  bomb"  (example)  in  free  multi-purpose  bombs 
 on  the  whereabouts  of  the  General  Assembly  global  satellite 
 positioning  system  (GPS)  reception  she  produced.  The  155-a 
 "smart"  bombs  that  cost  more  than  20,000  US  dollars.  It 
 is  learnt  that  many  countries  are  interested  in  purchasing 
 or  imitation.  Experts  also  believe  that  with  precision  guided 
 weapons,  the  US  network  battlefield  command  and  control  system 
 is  also  a  potential  "sell  ".  As  the  campaign  launched  by 
 US  troops  an  important  part  of  the  high-tech  war  by  the 
 Lockheed  Martin  and  battlefield  command  and  control  system 
 developed  by  the  unmanned  reconnaissance  aircraft,  satellites 
 and  ground  forces  to  coordinate  communication,  information 
 from  various  sources  to  provide  a  complete  analysis  of  the 
 battlefield  situation.

 in  the  first  British  airborne  suffered  complete  failure.  It 
 is  surprising  that  the  United  States  for  British  forces  to

 experience  as  a  result  is  a  tragedy.  "  Al-Sahaf  said  only

 China  Institute  of  International  experts  on  the  Middle  East 
 Li  Guofu  recently  in  told  Xinhua  said  that  the  US  war  against 
 Iraq,  the  will  to  global  stability  and  the  Middle  East  region's 
 political  strength  and  security  situation  and  the  Palestinian-Israeli 
 conflict  have  a  significant  impact.  (1)  push  unilateralism 
 concentrated  reflection  of  the  Li  Guofu,  said  that  Iraq  war 
 is  still  a  regional  war,  but  it  is  not  a  simple  regional 
 wars.  The  war  since  the  Bush  administration  unilateralism 
 in  concentrated  form.  From  the  international  relations  point 
 of  view,  the  war  that  is  shaped  after  the  end  of  World 
 War  II  the  United  States  was  trying  to  break  the  basic 
 norms  of  international  relations,  in  the  new  century  dominated 
 by  the  United  States  for  international  relations  in  the  war. 
 He  pointed  out  that  the  war  reflects  the  international  political 
 forces  in  the  world  imbalances.  He  said:  "the  most  of  whose 
 members  are  opposed  to  the  United  States  attacks  on  Iraq, 
 however,  the  United  States  is  imposing  launched  a  war.  The 
 progress  of  the  war  has  shown  that  even  if  the  United  States 
 strong,  and  not  go  unchallenged,  the  post-war  the  United 
 States  will  have  to  return  to  the  United  Nations  ".  He 
 expressed  the  belief  that  the  United  States  launched  the 
 war  there  is  a  profound  strategic  purposes.  The  Iran-Iraq 
 war  that  will  not  only  affect  Iraq  and  its  surrounding  areas 
 but  which  could  affect  the  entire  world.  If  the  United  States 
 occupation  of  Kuwait  to  the  Gulf  region  as  its  strategic 
 high  ground  in  Eurasia,  had  a  better  strategic  advantage. 
 Li  Guofu  pointed  out  that  the  United  States  has  been  captured 
 in  southern  Iraq  by  some  cities,  but  still  failed  to  find 
 the  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Now,  the  United  Nations 
 Secretary-General  Kofi  Annan  has  indicated  to  allow  inspectors 
 to  return  to  Iraq  as  soon  as  possible  for  verification. 
 He  stressed  that  "whether  in  the  investigation  of  Iraq's 
 weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  the  United  Nations  arms  inspection 
 teams  have  the  final  say."  (subtitle)  situation  in  the  Middle 
 East  war  impact  Li  Guofu  said  that  the  United  States  launched 
 the  war  on  the  Middle  East  region's  political  strength  and 
 security  situation  and  the  Palestinian-Israeli  conflict  have 
 significant  impact.  He  pointed  out  that  Iraq  both  in  size, 
 population,  resources,  said  the  Arab  countries  are  very  important, 
 if  the  United  States  to  win  the  war,  in  the  Gulf  region 
 will  further  foster  pro-American  forces.  The  balance  of  forces 
 in  the  Middle  East  region  a  more  favorable  to  the  United 
 States.  The  United  States  wants  to  control  Middle  East  region, 
 will  be  controlling  the  Gulf  region.  He  said  that  1991  Gulf 
 War,  although  Iraq  has  experienced  12  years  of  sanctions, 
 national  strength  has  been  greatly  weakened,  but  still  do 
 not  succumb  to  the  United  States.  The  United  States  believes 
 that  Iraq  is  the  backbone  force  against  the  United  States 
 in  the  Middle  East,  and  to  some  extent  as  a  Middle  East 
 encouraged  by  the  United  States  and  Israel  against  the  symbol 
 of  the  radical  forces  and  the  United  States  will  want  to 
 become  a  thorn  in  the  side.  He  said  that  for  a  long  time, 
 the  United  States  in  the  Gulf  region  is  "double  containment 
 policy"  to  contain  Iran  and  Iraq.  Iraq's  eastern  Iran,  the 
 west  side  is  Syria,  Iran's  national  strength  more  powerful. 
 The  three  countries  in  support  of  terrorism  by  the  United 
 States  as  "rogue  states  ",  Iraq  and  Iran  is  regarded  as" 
 the  axis  of  evil  ".  The  United  States  in  the  war  on  terrorism 
 is  the  first  strikes  against  Afghanistan  to  overthrow  the 
 Taliban  regime  in  eastern  Iran  changing  security  environment. 
 As  soon  as  the  United  States  to  enter  Iraq,  Iran  will  plunge 
 into  a  double  attack  from  both  sides  of  the  United  States. 
 He  said,  speaking  from  the  security  environment,  the  United 
 States  to  enter  Iraq  to  Syria  will  also  be  a  serious  threat. 
 In  the  economic,  Syria  each  year  from  Iraq  was  much  lower 
 than  market  prices  of  oil,  once  the  United  States  to  win 
 the  war,  Syria's  economic  development  would  be  greatly  affected. 
 (1)  The  United  States  has  underestimated  the  feelings  of 
 the  Iraqi  people  Li  Guofu  said  that  the  United  States  is 
 totally  underestimated  the  people  of  Iraq's  national  sensitivities. 
 The  United  States  March  20  war,  far  from  the  process  of 
 war  between  the  United  States  as  expected.  The  US  side  will 
 position  US  military  action  to  "liberate"  the  people  of  Iraq, 
 the  Iraqi  people  would  be  expected  "support  ",  and  in  fact 
 they  were  the  people  of  Iraq's  stubborn  resistance.  The  Iraqi 
 people  believe  that  the  United  States  invaded  their  country, 
 has  caused  much  damage  their  national  pride.  The  United  States 
 has  underestimated  the  Iraqi  people's  national  consciousness. 
 He  said  that  the  Iraqi  war  break  out  as  a  sovereign  state 
 living  environment  of  peace  on  the  Iraqi  people  has  led 
 to  a  humanitarian  catastrophe.  The  Iraqi  children  cry,  my 
 heart  was  strong  shock  on  the  Iraqi  people,  the  war  is 
 a  calamity.

 China's  "Economic  Daily"  published  on  April  2  signed  article, 
 entitled  "war  involving  British  economy  ".  Transmission  is 
 as  follows  :  British  Prime  Minister  Blair's  Labor  government 
 of  Iraq's  participation  in  the  United  States  launched  large-scale 
 war  not  only  by  the  opposition  Labor  Party  members,  causing 
 massive  internal  popular  anti-war  demonstrations,  and  the  economic 
 downturn  and  the  British  economy  poses  a  serious  negative 
 impact.  The  war  has  seriously  increase  the  financial  burden 
 of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  British  government  has  allocated 
 1.75  billion  pounds  for  this  war,  widely  expected  Chancellor 
 of  the  Exchequer  Brown  budget  on  April  9,  this  amount  will 
 increase  by  3  billion  to  4  billion  pounds.  Economic  experts 
 here  pointed  out  that  this  figure  is  based  on  the  war  only 
 a  month  to  conservative  estimates  of  the  war  and  delaying 
 a  month  each,  the  British  taxpayers  need  to  pay  more  than 
 750  million  pounds.  At  the  moment,  the  Iraqi  war  is  not 
 expected  before  the  war  as  well,  "behead"  attack  did  not 
 work,  capture  Baghdad  plans  had  been  postponed,  war  "quick" 
 begun  to  dissipate  the  tone  of  the  Iran-Iraq  war  to  fight 
 what  it  is  difficult  to  predict  how  long.  Therefore,  the 
 process  of  war  will  continue  to  increase  British  financial 
 pressure.  The  British  are  financial  difficulties,  the  government 
 calls  for  a  substantial  increase  in  tuition  fees  causing 
 widespread  dissatisfaction  among  middle  class  in  London  and 
 other  cities  city  fees  levied  on  vehicles  and  heavy  fines 
 have  aroused  strong  reaction,  the  government  revenue  and  expenditure 
 have  encountered  many  difficulties  and  obstacles.  US  and  British 
 deploy  forces  as  early  as  the  war,  Iraq  is  approaching, 
 the  British  economic  growth  and  investment  confidence  has 
 been  a  great  impact.  According  to  figures  released  by  the 
 British  National  Bureau  of  Statistics,  gross  domestic  product 
 in  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year  started  to  decline,  only 
 0.4%  growth  over  the  previous  quarter.  The  annual  growth 
 rate  of  1.8  %,  far  below  the  government  predicts  2.5%  - 
 3%  growth  target.  The  fourth  quarter  net  investment  regime 
 institutions  reduced  to  12.1  billion  pounds,  50%  drop  over 
 the  previous  quarter.  By  the  war,  the  British  consumer  confidence 
 decline,  prices  plunged.  The  latest  survey  results  show  that 
 as  a  result  of  the  war,  the  British  consumer  confidence 
 received  a  heavy  blow  to  March  consumer  confidence  index 
 in  February  dropped  sharply  again  on  the  basis  of  a  serious 
 setback  10  percentage  points,  fell  to  7  years  to  the  lowest 
 point.  About  55%  of  respondents  believe  that  economy  in  the 
 next  12  months  will  continue  to  deteriorate,  it  is  the  first 
 time  since  the  Gulf  War  more  than  10  years  since  the  worst 
 record.  Investigations  showed  that  only  32%  of  the  consumers 
 believe  that  it  is  time  for  the  purchase,  retail  sales  growth 
 has  fallen  to  its  lowest  level  over  the  past  three  years. 
 The  war  by  other  factors,  the  London  daily  the  business 
 of  well-known  commercial  street  Oxford  2  million  loss.  John 
 Lewis  department  store  manager  of  the  100  tons,  bringing 
 the  total  store  war  "heavy  losses"  and  sales  fell  by  12%. 
 The  introduction  this  year's  budget  will  increase  tax  revenue 
 is  expected  to  exacerbate  consumer  confidence.  According  to 
 the  British  authority  statistics,  last  year  the  British  national 
 real  estate  value-added  470  billion  pounds,  could  be  offset 
 by  the  British  family  financial  assets  depreciate  falling 
 stock  prices  have  caused  the  loss  of  432  billion  pounds. 
 However,  the  continuing  rise  in  prices  of  unsustainable.  Property 
 market  analysts  believe  that  before  the  end  of  this  year, 
 the  south  of  England  economically  developed  areas  will  decline 
 in  prices  in  London  property  prices  slipped  7.3  %,  the  London 
 market  economy  is  close  to  the  edge  of  a  recession.  In 
 recent  years,  the  British  economic  growth  year-on-year  decline, 
 with  consumer  prices  vigorous  and  sustained  economic  growth 
 is  expected  to  rise  two  major  factors.  If  the  Iran-Iraq 
 war  and  drag  enormous  casualties  suffered  by  British  business 
 and  consumers  is  very  likely  generally  weak  economic  prospects, 
 sustainable  consumption  and  depressed  prices  low,  the  economy 
 will  lose  power  suffered  enormous  losses.  British  economic 
 growth  is  expected  to  be  the  year  2003  could  be  further 
 reduced.  (  end  )

 "Guardian"  First,  Iraqi  war  full  swing,  the  United  States 
 by  a  secret  Iraqi  regime  post-war  reconstruction  plan  to 
 stay  calm  and  collected  pipeline.  However,  the  government 
 of  the  United  States  as  the  abacus  has  prompted  it  to  the 
 most  intimate  "allies"  raised  objections.  "Guardian"  knowledge 
 from  the  government  of  the  United  States  was  aware  of  the 
 population,  according  to  the  plan,  Iraq's  post-war  transitional 
 government  will  set  up  by  23  ministerial  departments,  the 
 minister  will  be  appointed  by  the  Americans,  each  equipped 
 with  four  Iraqi  Department  senior  adviser,  candidates  are 
 designated  by  the  government  of  the  United  States.  The  new 
 government  will  push  forward  the  process  with  the  war,  the 
 Iraqi  occupation  of  the  US  military  take-over-size  cities. 
 At  present,  there  is  a  "transitional  government  members"  have 
 arrived  in  Kuwait,  began  preparing  to  launch  the  scheme. 
 In  the  United  States  Vice-Minister  for  Political  Affairs  Department 
 of  Defense  Paul  Wolfowitz  and  other  senior  government  officials 
 it  appears  that  the  United  States,  the  formation  of  the 
 transitional  government  Iraq  seems  to  be  entirely  in  the 
 United  States  government.  Wolfowitz  in  consultants  recommended 
 by  a  prominent  Iraqi  opposition  group  the  Iraqi  National 
 Congress  leader  Ahmad  Chalabi,  and  his  nephew  assistant  is 
 one  of  the  group.  So  far,  many  members  Shrabi  close  relations 
 with  the  U.S.  Congress,  the  US  government  granted  the  substantial 
 financial  support.  He  is  the  Pentagon  in  the  eyes  of  the 
 "favorite  ",  US  Defense  Secretary  Donald  Rumsfeld  is"  good 
 "than  among  those  who  salad.  On  the  contrary,  the  US  State 
 Department  and  CIA  have  to  worry  about  than  salad,  which 
 since  1956  we  have  not  had  a  step  further  on  Iraqi  territory 
 by  opponents  of  the  government  did  not  have  much  support 
 in  Iraq,  little  influence.  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell 
 last  week's  public  statements,  once  the  United  States  won 
 Iraq  war,  the  US  military  will  take  over  the  reconstruction 
 of  the  Iraqi  regime.  In  accordance  with  "Guardian"  the  reporter 
 Bu  Laien  and  Lu,  the  Whitaker  Harding  said,  Shrabi  whole 
 heart  to  the  post-war  Iraq's  new  government  of  prime  minister. 
 However,  the  US  plan  did  not  want  to  set  up  the  post, 
 but  only  to  have  been  Shrabi  of  bankers  in  the  Ministry 
 of  Finance  to  remain  a  consultancy  position.  The  Shrabi  very 
 much  disappointed  with  his  hands.  A  senior  Iraqi  National 
 Assembly  members  on  31  March  the  Kurds  of  northern  Iraq 
 controlled  accepted  "Guardian"  interview,  Shrabi  will  not  accept 
 "a  purely  advisory  post  ".  He  said:  "in  Iraq  (a  new  government) 
 ministers  to  any  one  of  the  United  States  as  consultants, 
 of  course,  this  is  not  the  Iraqi  National  Assembly.  Our 
 position  is  that  the  United  States  should  not  charge  the 
 government  of  Iraq.  The  United  States  are  talking  about  an 
 Iraqi  transitional  government,  and  we  are  asking  for  an  interim 
 government.  "  As  a  British  newspaper  reporters  Whitaker  and 
 Harding  found  that  his  government  intended  to  direct  management 
 in  the  post-war  Iraq  has  not  only  to  the  Iraqi  opposition 
 dissatisfaction,  have  great  potential  for  Bush's  inveterate 
 ally,  British  Prime  Minister  Tony  Blair  was  "very  uncomfortable 
 ".  In  order  to  reduce  use  of  force  against  Iraq  because 
 of  support  for  the  United  States  incurred  a  piece  of  the 
 British  domestic  opposition,  Blair  has  called  for  United  Nations 
 intervention  in  Iraq's  post-war  reconstruction.  The  United 
 States  that  a  secret  plan  to  Blair  not  recorded  as  a  "resounding 
 slap  on  the  face  ".

 the  high  temperatures  for  the  two  warring  sides.  The  chairpersons: 
 Xinhua  News  Agency  reporter  Bao  Erwen  Q:  a  few  days  ago, 
 strong  sandstorm  weather  slowed  the  United  States  and  British 
 forces  against  Iraq's  offensive.  In  the  past  few  days,  Iraq 
 is  obviously  the  temperature  rise,  according  to  reports,  this 
 week  that  might  achieve  maximum  temperature  39  degrees  Celsius. 
 Since  then,  the  temperature  will  rise  further.  The  hot  weather 
 and  the  United  States  and  British  forces  from  the  Iraqi 
 armed  forces  .  Answer:  In  April,  Iraq,  especially  in  the 
 desert  region  temperature  rise  soon.  No  hot  weather  Believed 
 to  be  engaged  in  the  United  States  and  British  forces  against 
 Iraqi  forces  and  have  a  greater  impact,  particularly  in  the 
 following  :  The  military  operations,  a  few  days,  this  is 
 very  fatigue  and  high  temperatures  will  further  their  energy 
 consumption  and  undermine  their  combat  effectiveness.  High 
 temperatures  will  enable  tanks,  armored  internal  or  external 
 temperature  higher  than  the  fighters  inside  the  more  difficult 
 to  be  patient.  Three  soldiers  in  fighting  and  heavy  chemical 
 and  biological  weapons,  wearing  protective  clothing,  then  they 
 during  the  campaign,  in  particular,  will  run  breathing,  consume 
 a  lot  of  physical  education,  and  even  a  minor  suffocation. 
 Fourth,  high  temperatures  also  hinder  the  normal  number  of 
 hi-tech  weapons  effectiveness.  5,  high  temperatures  will  significantly 
 increase  the  pressure  of  logistical  operations  between  the 
 two  sides,  particularly  in  the  front-line  soldiers  a  continuous 
 supply  of  drinking  water.  Overall,  high  temperatures  of  more 
 than  the  United  States  and  British  forces  against  Iraqi  military 
 forces,  because  the  Iraqi  army  is  in  the  local  operations, 
 the  high  temperatures  have  a  very  strong  adaptability,  and 
 more  difficult  to  adapt  to  the  United  States  and  British 
 forces.  However,  the  effectiveness  of  the  two  sides  weather 
 factors  do  not  have  a  major  impact.

 "New  York  Times"  on  the  first  analysis  said  that  the  US 
 war  against  Iraq,  the  market  is  not  only  a  campaign  to 
 overthrow  Saddam,  the  church  is  also  a  new  military  strategy 
 courses.  The  war  will  be  defense  minister  to  the  United 
 States,  the  Philippines,  the  strategic  thinking,  the  test 
 of  De  Xinjun.  The  article,  entitled  "Rumsfeld,  have  been 
 tested:  New  Strategies  will  be  effective  ?"  says,  Rumsfeld 
 want  to  establish  a  more  flexible  and  able  to  cast  a  long-range 
 precision-guided  weapons,  making  full  use  of  troops  advanced 
 detection  technology.  The  two  weeks,  more  and  more  people 
 believe  that  this  strategy  did  not  work  in  Iraq  war.  Rumsfeld 
 is  promoting  a  model  that  stressed  the  advantages  of  using 
 US  air  strikes  and  special  forces  of  flexibility,  and  not 
 rely  on  army  heavily  armoured  forces.  His  supporters  believe 
 that  this  model  has  the  advantage  of  the  United  States  is 
 to  make  full  use  of  air  superiority,  and  greatly  shorten 
 the  time  the  army.  But  during  the  1991  Gulf  war  that  has 
 played  24  mechanized  division  of  the  United  States  and  Iraq 
 "the  Republican  Guard"  combat  retired  General  McCaffrey  said 
 that  this  model  based  on  the  basis  of  such  assumptions, 
 but  the  nature  of  the  war  has  changed  completely,  and  win 
 the  key  is  not  the  number  of  troops,  and  not  armour  and 
 artillery.  He  said  that  "Their  assumption  is  wrong."  At  the 
 beginning  of  the  war,  the  US  ground  troops  fighting  three 
 mechanized  infantry  division,  including  101  army  division  air 
 attack,  82nd  Airborne  Division  of  the  Brigade,  1-11  attack 
 helicopters,  and  a  marine  expeditionary  unit.  The  article 
 said,  and  the  United  States  to  achieve  the  ambitious  goals 
 than  the  number  of  troops  on  the  ground  is  obviously  not. 
 The  US  armed  forces  are  not  waiting  for  deployment  after 
 military  offensive,  but  border  attack  on  a  follow-up  border 
 force.  The  Pentagon  said  the  aim  is  to  maintain  great  flexibility, 
 once  Saddam's  regime  fall  suddenly,  the  follow-up  force  would 
 not  be  deployed.  But  critics  believe  that  Rumsfeld  is  not 
 such  a  strategy  as  he  is  flexible.  Although  the  army  to 
 rapid  deployment,  but  with  limited  in  number,  they  would 
 have  to  be  phased  implementation  of  its  operational  plan, 
 thereby  delaying  the  process  of  war,  and  a  large-scale  support 
 forces,  apparently  to  better  maintain  the  pace  attack.  The 
 article  said  that  Baghdad  will  be  the  service  to  Rumsfeld 
 strategy  the  final  tests.
