 Iraqi  Foreign  Minister  Naji  Sabri  said  today  in  Baghdad  that 
 Iraq  and  Turkey  "cooperate  to  bring  the  perpetrators  of  the 
 region,  according  to  Anatolia  news  agency.  In  an  interview 
 with  semi-official  Turkish  news  agency  said  Sabri  that  relations 
 between  the  two  countries  had  not  been  affected  by  events 
 that  occurred  in  the  region  throughout  history.  The  Brotherhood 
 said  Sabri,  regional  and  cultural  relations  between  the  two 
 peoples  have  not  been  deteriorating.  He  pointed  out  that 
 "whenever  stronger  bilateral  relations,  regional  security  would 
 be  enhanced."  Sabri  asserted  that  trade  between  the  two  countries 
 have  collapsed  and  Turkey  have  lost  billions  of  dollars  of 
 America  because  of  the  embargo  imposed  on  Iraq  because  of 
 the  American  aggression  after  the  Gulf  War  in  1991.  On  the 
 military  strikes  launched  by  the  United  States  and  Britain 
 currently  Sabri  said  "this  act  of  aggression  runs  counter 
 to  the  international  resolutions  and  the  United  Nations  Charter." 
 He  pointed  out  that  the  United  States  wanted  to  generate 
 the  Turkish  government  and  people-friendly  neighbour  Turkish 
 non-Muslim  war  whose  outcome  is  known.  Sabri,  pledged  to 
 continue  its  war  against  Iraq  aggression  even  out  the  invaders. 
 The  Turkish  parliament  had  rejected  a  proposal  for  a  government 
 on  1  March  to  allow  the  deployment  of  62  thousand  American 
 troops  in  Turkey  to  open  the  front  north  of  the  war  against 
 Iraq.  Since  the  United  States  and  Britain  launched  a  war 
 against  Iraq  vigorous  resistance  in  southern  Iraq.  American 
 officials  have  begun  to  return  to  focus  on  plans  to  open 
 North  Front  will  bring  US  Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell's 
 visit  to  Ankara  in  an  unexpected  tomorrow  in  order  to  win

 British  Foreign  Secretary  Jack  Straw  today  called  for  an 
 international  conference  sponsored  by  the  United  Nations  on 
 the  government  of  the  post-war  in  Iraq,  where  military  operations 
 started  under  the  leadership  of  the  United  States  to  topple 
 Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein  on  March  20.  Straw  said  British 
 newspaper  here  "will  have  to  choose  a  new  government  in 
 Iraq  on  the  pattern  of  the  Conference  of  the,  Germany,  in 
 2001  when  he  was  appointed,  Hamid  Karzai,  chairman  of  the 
 new  government  in  Afghanistan  after  the  overthrow  of  the 
 at  the  hands  of  the  American  forces.  Straw  told  journalists 
 "I  hope  all  the  strength  of  the  United  Nations  to  be  a 
 key  role  in  organizing  a  conference  to  bring  together  representatives 
 of  all  sectors  of  the  Iraqi  society  after  the  overthrow 
 of  Saddam  Hussein."  He  added  that  "the  aim  of  such  a  conference 
 is  the  responsibility  of  political  and  economic  decision-making 
 on  the  future  of  Iraq  in  the  hands  of  the  Iraqi  people, 
 stressing  that  Britain  is  committed  to  eliminate  Iraq's  humanitarian 
 assistance  after  the  war.  Britain  paid  Washington  to  seek 
 to  involve  the  United  Nations  in  Iraq  after  the  war  without 
 receiving  a  response  from  the  American  President  George  W. 
 Bush  and  so  far.  On  the  other  hand,  Straw  had  said  that 
 the  reconstruction  of  Iraq  could  last  several  years.  He  said,

 such  as  oil  wells  and  move  towards  the  second  phase  of 
 the  "steady  progress."  The  spokesman  said  "we  are  now  in 
 the  stage  of  steady  progress  you  see  signs  of  steady  progress 
 in  moving  towards  Basra,  thus  weakening  the  opposition  here 
 and  there  will  begin  the  process  of  assertions  of  the  military 
 structure  in  the  areas  under  control."  However,  he  said  that 
 "no  one  is  being  subjected  to  any  illusions.  There  will 
 be  more  difficulties,  there  will  be  more  deaths  in  the  military 
 and  despite  intensive  efforts  to  avoid  this.  "

 Saddam  Hussein  to  resign  Riyadh  early  April  /  Xinhua  /  New 
 Saudi  Prince  Saud  al-Faisal,  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs 
 here  today  Tuesday  called  upon  the  Iraqi  President  Saddam 
 Hussein  to  excuse  his  government  to  advise  him  to  "sacrifice" 
 of  the  people  war.  He  said  the  Saudi  Foreign  Minister  Prince 
 Saud  al-Faisal,  in  a  press  conference  held  here  today  that 
 Saudi  Arabia  have  been  put  forward  ideas  could  not  be  accompanied 
 by  an  appeal  to  Unless  the  parties  agree  to  stop  the  war

 confidence  to  put  an  end  to  the  rules  of  the  Iraqi  problem. 
 Prince  Saud  al  Faisal  pointed  out  that  the  current  situation 
 in  Iraq  has  become  more  complex  and  carries  the  promise 
 a  lot  of  risks  that  unpredictable  future  unless  it  was  responding 
 to  the  voice  of  reason  and  wisdom  and  end  the  crisis  peacefully. 
 Prince  Saud  al-Faisal  stressed  once  again  the  rejection  of 
 military  operations  or  the  appointment  of  the  government  of 
 Saudi  Arabia  from  abroad.  He  pointed  out  that  the  Iraqi 
 people  his  government,  which  wants  free  will.  At  the  same 
 time,  the  Saudi  minister  drew  attention  to  the  importance 
 of  maintaining  the  sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity  of 
 Iraq.  On  the  current  state  of  Kuwait's  position  in  the  Arab 
 and  Islamic  world  and  Prince  Saud  al-Faisal,  confirmed  that 
 Saudi  Arabia  "understands  very  well  aware  of  the  State  of 
 Kuwait  and  is  confronted  with  the  size  of  the  risks  to 
 during  this  critical  stage,  pointing  out  that"  the  question 
 in  the  positions  of  the  State  of  Kuwait,  the  situation  does 
 not  understand  the  reality  of  Kuwait.  He  believed  that  Prince 
 Saud  al-Faisal,  who  in  the  positions  of  the  State  of  Kuwait 
 is  not  fair.  Saudi  Arabia  also  welcomed  the  decision  of 
 the  United  Nations  to  resume  the  oil-for-food  programme  acknowledging 
 that  Saudi  Arabia  continues  to  mobilize  humanitarian  assistance 
 to  its  borders  with  Iraq,  delivery  to  those  in  need  in 
 their  places  in  coordination  with  international  bodies  concerned 
 and  Red  Crescent  Societies  in  Saudi  Arabia.  On  the  Palestinian 
 issue  called  upon  the  international  community  not  to  forget

 regard  to  the  call  for  the  formation  of  a  new  entity  as 
 a  substitute  for  the  Arab  League  to  draft  submitted  by  Saudi 
 Crown  Prince  Abdullah  bin  Abdul  Aziz,  the  Arab  summit  in 
 Sharm  el-Sheikh  in  the  recent  Egyptian  is  an  essential  reference 
 to  any  directions  for  the  reform  of  the  Arab  situation. 
 He  added:  "There  is  no  objection  to  the  reform  of  the  situation 
 if  there  is  a  need  for  the  Arab  League  member  states  must 
 reflect  the  policy  of  seriousness  and  credibility  in  the 
 implementation  of  decisions."  Syria  and  the  resulting  from 
 the  accusation  that  Washington  had  supported  Iraq,  Al-Faisal 
 said  that  "there  is  no  indication  so  far  to  drag  Syria 
 war  broke  out  spread  risks,  but  others,  particularly  in  the 
 Middle  East,  which  is  suffering  from  chronic  instability  that 
 would  allow  Israel  to  take  advantage  of  all  the  conditions 
 for  illegal  acts."  He  added:  "If  there  are  accusations  against 
 Syria's  support  of  Iraq  must  be  highlighted."  He  added  that 
 Syria's  political  position  in  favour  of  Iraq  and  Syria  could 
 not  have  to  take  a  stand  against  any  Arab  state's  brother. 
 He  denied  the  Saudi  minister  of  the  use  of  American  forces 
 base  south  of  Riyadh  Prince  expenditure  governorate,  referring 
 to  the  position  of  Saudi  Arabia's  firm  rejection  of  war
