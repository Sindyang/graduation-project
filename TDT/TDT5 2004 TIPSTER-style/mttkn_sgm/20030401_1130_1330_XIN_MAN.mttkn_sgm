 Global  Warming-driven  water  cycle  changes  have  led  to  northwest 
 China  most  of  the  climate  in  the  warm  dry  to  warm  wet 
 omen.  Scientists  predict  that  the  trend  will  continue  to 
 be  wet  2050  throughout  the  West.  The  Chinese  Academy  of 
 Sciences  held  here  Shi  Yafeng  international  scientific  seminar 
 on  climate  change,  global  warming  to  speed  up  water  cycle, 
 from  the  ocean  and  the  mainland's  exports  to  the  mainland 
 vapor  humid  areas  increased  evaporation  of  vapor.  This  is 
 the  root  causes  of  northwest  China  increased  precipitation. 
 Since  the  1990s  in  the  north-west  air  vapor  content  increased 
 significantly.  Shi  Yafeng  said:  "New  vapor  Tropical  Ocean 
 mainly  from  the  south  part  with  vapor  from  westerly  wind." 
 Northwest  China's  inland  deep,  and  around  the  surrounding 
 mountains,  far  from  the  sea  humid  air  currents,  China  has 
 always  been  the  most  arid  area.  However,  over  the  past  decades 
 of  meteorological  monitoring  shows  that  1987  is  heated  by 
 Northwest  wet-dry  to  warm  the  mutations.  In  the  central  part 
 of  Tianshan  Mountain  in  the  Bositeng  lake  water  more  than 
 30  years  after  the  record  of  consecutive  decline,  rising 
 water  levels  in  1987,  Lake  area  increased  to  1,000  square 
 kilometres.  Xinjiang  also  flood  surge  in  the  year.  At  present, 
 northwest  China  mainly  affected  by  the  westerly  wind  circulation 
 in  areas  where  the  rainfall  and  increased  water  runoff,  lakes, 
 Accelerated  Melting  glaciers,  dust  storms  days,  vegetation 
 and  welcome  improvement.  Academician  Shi  Yafeng  warm  wet  changing 
 trends  in  accordance  with  the  remarkable  transformation  in 
 north-west  district,  light  Transition  Region  and  the  transition. 
 It  did  not  refer  to  the  area  in  eastern  North-west  of  the 
 Middle  East  Department  in  Gansu,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi  and  Ningxia 
 north-east  of  the  climate  is  still  continuing  drought.  Shi 
 Yafeng  said:  "Although  the  global  warming  has  exacerbated 
 the  south  of  the  tropical  ocean  vapor  transmission  to  the 
 north,  but  in  recent  years  the  northwest  region  a  high-altitude 
 wind  of  change  to  the  western  agglomerations  vapor  in  the 
 north-west  and  north  eastern  winds  strengthened  from  the  south-east 
 direction  would  undermine  the  vapor  transmission,  which  may 
 result  in  the  northwestern  region  of  western  Tungkan  wet." 
 He  believed,  however,  as  the  warming-level  rise,  the  water 
 cycle  has  been  constantly  strengthened  and  the  trend  towards 
 increased  precipitation  will  exist  for  a  long  time  and  Northwest 
 throughout  north  China  have  turned  to  warm  and  wet.  According 
 to  the  forecast,  natural  factors  and  comprehensive  study  the 
 impact  of  human  activity  in  2050,  the  northwest  provinces 
 average  temperature  will  rise  1.5  -  2.6  degrees  Celsius, 
 and  precipitation  4-34%  increase,  glaciers  into  water  will 
 be  increased  by  more  than  50%.  In  fact,  a  large  number

 held  here  on  Climate  Change  international  scientific  seminars, 
 scientists  believe  that  global  warming  will  not  be  bound 
 to  result  in  tropical  cyclone  increased,  to  China's  coastal 
 areas  of  the  impact  will  not  be  increased.  Meteorological 
 experts  from  Hong  Kong  had  studied  in  the  past  50  years 
 Chen  Zhongliang  arising  from  the  Western  North  Pacific  cyclone. 
 He  believed  that  the  intensity  of  tropical  cyclone  sea  surface 
 temperature  and  the  region  and  the  eastern  equatorial  Pacific 
 link  between  the  sea  surface  temperature,  and  the  impact 
 of  climate  warming  trend  is  to  be  small.  Chen  Zhongliang, 
 global  warming  will  affect  cyclone  Development  and  Sports, 
 but  it  will  not  lead  to  tropical  cyclone  strength.  China 
 is  heated  with  Cyclone  against  one  of  the  countries  most 
 severely.  Tropical  cyclone  manifestations  -  Tropical  Cyclones, 
 typhoons  caused  by  torrential  rains  in  coastal  areas  of  the 
 destructive  power  of  a  very  strong.  Cyclone  movement  of  any 
 sudden  changes,  such  as  wind  direction,  wind  speed  and  landing 
 rainfall  after  the  change  for  the  prevention  and  mitigation 
 can  have  a  great  impact.  Studies  show  that  China  is  the 
 world  largest  landing  wind  power.  1949-1997  years,  the  Asia-Pacific 
 region  fall  summer  typhoon  landed  a  753,  which  landed  in 
 China  in  the  347,  40%.  China's  southeast  coastal  areas  every 
 year  in  landing  the  typhoon  would  cause  billions  of  dollars 
 in  economic  losses.  Studies  also  indicate  that  tropical  cyclone 
 activities  such  as  El  Nino  weather  phenomenon  closely  linked, 
 and  the  atmospheric  circulation,  sea  surface  temperature.  The 
 "El  Nino"  Landing  China  Typhoon  year  low,  and  in  the  fight 
 against  "El  Nino"  typhoon  landing  too  many  years.  The  Chinese 
 Academy  of  Meteorology  said  Academician  Chen  Lianshou:  "These 
 factors  are  subject  to  the  effects  of  global  warming.  The 
 global  warming  trend  in  the  next  decades  with  Cyclone  internal 
 heat  the  frequency  and  intensity  is  what  the  changes  were 
 still  needs  to  be  a  matter  of  concern.  "  The  experts  called 
 for  the  World  Meteorological  Organization,  as  well  as  in 
 the  national  meteorological  research  institutes  should  strengthen 
 exchanges  and  cooperation  to  jointly  explore  tropical  cyclone 
 and  global  warming  relations,  thus  reducing  the  danger  of 
 tropical  cyclone  to  mankind.

 China's  permanent  missions  to  the  United  Nations  in  Geneva 
 Sha  Zukang  head  of  the  59th  conference  on  human  rights  in 
 the  first  discussion  of  the  country  subject  to  expose  some 
 Western  countries  interfering  in  other  countries'  human  rights. 
 Sha  Zukang  noted  that  the  country-specific  issues  include 
 human  rights  agenda  36  years  has  been  the  world  have  undergone 
 significant  changes.  It  is  regrettable  that  a  political  confrontation 
 has  characterized  the  cold  war  in  all  institutions  of  the 
 United  Nations,  particularly  in  the  Human  Rights  Commission, 
 is  still  going  on.  He  said  that  as  early  as  in  the  18 
 and  19th  century,  a  group  of  Western  countries  engaged  in 
 a  large-scale  violations  of  human  rights  of  the  colonial 
 war  of  aggression.  Today,  the  accused,  target  of  almost  all 
 their  former  colonies,  today's  developing  countries.  If  people 
 do  not  know  what  is  called  confuse  right  and  wrong,  what 
 is  called  power  politics,  what  is  called  double  standards, 
 the  human  rights  will  be  on  the  discussion  is  the  best 
 indescribably  classes.  Sha  Zukang  stressed  that  the  blind 
 human  rights  in  a  country  is  a  humanitarian  catastrophe  and 
 tens  of  thousands  of  women,  children  and  the  elderly  bloodshed 
 and  death,  but  while  pretending  to  be  a  number  of  states 
 in  all  seriousness  about  the  human  rights,  in  every  possible 
 way  for  Refugees  in  the  context  of  globalization  difficulties 
 in  developing  countries,  it  is  ironic.  On  China's  human  rights 
 situation,  Sha  Zukang  said  that  today's  China  is  a  full 
 ownership  by  the  people  of  the  largest  developing  countries, 
 the  human  rights  situation  is  at  best  period  in  history, 
 some  Western  countries  or  some  people  have  felt  uncomfortable, 
 seeking  to  defame  China,  and  named  China  as  a  target  of 
 attacks  and  accusations.  I  would  like  to  tell  them  that 
 most  concerned  about  1.3  billion  Chinese  people's  human  rights 
 is  that  the  Chinese  government.  With  regard  to  your  concern 
 is  whether  to  accept  that  are  not  important,  even  as  senseless 
 and  no  one  in  the  world  can  stop  the  Chinese  people  in 
 their  chosen  the  path  of  advancement.  Sha  Zukang  finally 
 stressed:  "We  are  against  political  confrontation  and  not 
 fear  of  political  confrontation,  but  because  of  political 
 confrontation  does  not  have  a  culture  of  peace.  We  are  against 
 indescribably,  indescribably  state  is  not  afraid,  but  because 
 the  indescribably  case  would  not  help  to  protect  and  promote 
 human  rights.  Countries  can  be  found  through  dialogue  and 
 cooperation  to  address  the  issue  of  human  rights  in  a  serious 
 reflection  and  genuine  reform.  "
