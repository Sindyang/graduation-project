 Jordan  "Al  Rai"  and  "Jordan  Times"  The  first  Jordanian  Minister 
 of  Information  Adouane  issued  a  statement  denying  Jordan  runs 
 counter  to  the  relevant  United  Nations  resolutions  prohibiting 
 the  export  of  arms  to  Iraq.  Adouan  said  that  recently  some 
 Western  media  reports  said  that  in  the  southern  city  Basra 
 5  kilometres  east  found  a  large  warehouses  and  found  boxes 
 marked  "the  armed  forces"  words  of  arms.  He  said  that  "everyone 
 should  know  this  is  an  old  warehouse,  built  in  1990  before 
 ".  Adouane  those  accusations  were  subjected  to  Jordan.  He 
 said,  even  though  Jordan  arms  found  in  Iraq,  it  would  certainly 
 be  operated  in  the  United  Nations  has  yet  to  impose  an 
 arms  embargo  against  Iraq.  Iraqi  troops  invaded  Kuwait  in 
 1989  by  the  United  Nations  and  the  comprehensive  sanctions, 
 including  the  arms  embargo  on  some  of  the  sanctions  have 
 not  yet  been  lifted.  At  present,  the  US  and  British  forces 
 are  to  eliminate  weapons  of  mass  destruction  as  a  pretext 
 to  launch  a  comprehensive  attack  on  Iraq.

 on  soldiers  registered  in  the  war:  a  battlefield  commanders 
 are  unwilling  to  face  --  Military  experts  to  discuss  urban 
 warfare  example  urban  warfare  and  well-known  Xinhua  reporter 
 Wang  Dongming  Former  US  Marine  Corps  has  a  high-ranking  official 
 said:  "Fighting  urban  warfare  is  unwise,  experienced  the  military 
 commanders  of  the  city  is  often  the  worst  in  the  war  as 
 an  option."  The  British  and  US  forces  have  launched  a  major 
 offensive  against  the  Iraqi  capital  Baghdad  arrow  in  string, 
 but  they  have  become  even  more  cautious  and  anxiety.  Why 
 cities  better-equipped  and  trained  for  combat  and  combat  experience 
 so  arising  from  the  British  and  US  forces  Tremendous  pressure 
 ?  Urban  Warfare  School  in  the  military  tactics,  the  special 
 conditions  included  in  the  fighting.  Military  experts  said 
 that  war-city  General  with  the  following  features  :  First, 
 the  urban  warfare  is  both  attack  and  defense  and  security 
 in  order  to  capture  city  department  must  be  carried  out 
 ground  operations  Team  ;  Second,  as  a  result  of  urban  buildings 
 have  been  divided  into  a  relatively  narrow  space  between 
 the  two  sides  enemy  mixed  together  almost  in  the  face  And, 
 particularly  in  cities  has  a  large  number  of  civilians,  the 
 offensive  and  defensive  side  means  it  is  difficult  to  take 
 air  strikes.  3,  urban  building-intensive,  strong,  underground 
 facilities  more  for  defense  to  constitute  a  strong  position 
 To  form  a  multi-storey  firepower  and  long-term  commitment. 
 4,  the  offensive  formation  fighting  parties  likely  to  be 
 divided  observation,  shooting,  coordination  and  command  difficult 
 Mobile  armored  troops  was  limited.  Military  experts  said  that 
 historically,  the  offensive  in  the  casualty  rate  to  30%  - 
 40  %,  to  attack  the  casualty  rate  than  other  forms  of  fighting 
 high  casualty  rate  more  than  three  times.  The  city  more 
 firing  points,  easily  concealed  equipment  and  that  the  two 
 warring  sides  close,  the  offensive  directly  facing  the  snipers 
 and  ambushes  in  every  corner  of  the  city,  there  is  a  threat. 
 The  urban  war  casualties,  accidents,  many  features  of  a  long 
 time.  In  the  history  of  human  warfare,  Stalingrad  defensive 
 war  urban  setting  an  example  of  our  defense.  April  1942, 
 Hitler's  focus  on  the  strength  of  the  1.5  million  people, 
 a  large-scale  offensive  Stalingrad.  The  defense  Stalingrad, 
 the  Soviet  people  and  soldiers  in  Stalingrad  positive  530 
 km,  120  kilometers  deep  inside  and  outside  the  city,  built 
 a  4  zone  defense,  the  external  barriers  in  the  urban  areas 
 as  urban  as  external  support  for,  based  on  the  outskirts 
 in  large  numbers  of  anti-personnel,  consumption  and  destroying 
 the  enemy.  September  13,  1942,  the  German  army  Stalingrad 
 urban  attacks,  unusually  fierce  war  on  both  sides  in  the 
 streets  and  alleys  of  the  brutal  war.  Soviet  forces  and 
 the  German  Jun  Jinjin  around  each  street,  every  house,  an 
 intense  fighting.  Fierce  between  the  two  sides  in  the  region, 
 the  Soviet  army  in  housing,  street  areas  are  densely  covered 
 the  mines.  In  some  cases,  only  to  seize  a  building,  the 
 two  sides  should  work  hard  to  fight  to  the  death  several 
 weeks.  In  Stalingrad,  the  railway  station,  the  two  sides 
 battle  for  a  week  time,  13th  army  has  captured  the  railway 
 station,  13th  from  De  Su  Junyou  forces  recaptured  their  hands. 
 In  the  urban  area,  a  four-storey  building  ordinary  buildings, 
 the  Soviet  army  in  which  24  soldiers  continue  to  adhere 
 to  the  58  days,  the  army  repeated  shocks,  suffered  heavy 
 casualties,  but  will  not  be  able  to  capture  buildings.  In 
 some  of  the  buildings,  control  of  the  army  is  often  Germany 
 half  hold  and  guard  the  Soviet  army  while  the  other  half. 
 After  the  war,  a  German  soldier,  recalled:  "Think  Stalingrad 
 a  war  that  killed  80  days  and  nights  meat  grapple  with 
 the  scenes  of  fighting  it,  street  will  no  longer  be  meters 
 terms,  but  a  measurement  unit  for  bodies.  Stalingrad  is  simply 
 no  longer  city,  it  is  a  scene  hollow  engulfed  in  flames 
 and  smoke  is  simply  reflect  red  flames  block  melting  pot. 
 "  After  six  months  time  Stalingrad  battle  finally  put  an 
 end  to  Soviet  military  victory.  German  troops  killed  about 
 1.5  million  people  around  the  former  Soviet  Union  accounted 
 for  about  a  quarter  of  the  German  battlefield  strength,  the 
 Soviet  army  losses  have  been  killed.  Military  experts  to 
 assess  said:  "Stalingrad  battle  to  defend  the  city  as  an 
 important  front  and  destroy  the  enemy's  important  battlefield, 
 which  could  clamp  down  and  destroy  the  enemy  and  counter-offensive 
 as  a  transfer  to  the  well-known  war  conditions."

 technical  difficulties  and  artistic  expression  two  scores  are 
 the  two  totalling  6  hours,  which  was  unprecedented  in  history. 
 Secondly,  they  slide  in  the  free  competition  is  a  near  capacity
