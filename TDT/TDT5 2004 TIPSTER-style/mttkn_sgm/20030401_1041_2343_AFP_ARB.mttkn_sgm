 She  registry  Christian  Jerusalem  4-1  (AFP)  -  Recalled  killing 
 seven  Iraqi  women  and  children  at  an  army  roadblock  near 
 the  American  Najaf,  south  of  Iraq,  similar  tragedies  in  the 
 Palestinian  territories  since  the  intifada  start,  allowing 
 the  American-British  coalition  expected  to  commit  further  errors 
 and,  some  analysts  see  Israelis.  According  to  Shlomo  desire, 
 former  general  in  the  Israeli  army  Ifwg  analyst  at  the  Centre 
 for  Strategic  Studies  in  Tel  Aviv,  "I  think  that  we  will 
 witness  other  incidents,  because  the  American  forces  do  not 
 have  such  experience  of  war,  and  informed  them  that  the 
 environment.  In  the  wake  of  the  tragedy  that  took  place 
 at  an  army  roadblock  near  the  American  Najaf,  after  150 
 kilometres  south  of  Baghdad,  which  brings  Israeli  experts 
 to  say  that  the  American  forces  are  not  trained  to  deal 
 with  such  a  situation  which  deal  with  the  Israeli  army  on 
 a  daily  basis  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.  Despite 
 his  experience,  the  Israeli  army  committed  many  tragic  errors. 
 It  is  out  of  more  than  had  been  killed  since  the  beginning 
 of  the  Palestinian  intifada,  before  30  months,  at  least  58 
 killed,  including  20  women  and  13  children  -  The  Israeli 
 military  barriers,  and  emphasizes  the  Assembly  of  the  Palestinian 
 right  defending  human  rights.  The  Palestinian  Society  for 
 Human  Rights,  confirmed  that  72  Palestinians  were  killed  in 
 the  military  roadblocks.  In  addition  to  the  bloody  events, 
 now  Israeli  military  barriers,  which  is  expected  to  be  Palestinians 
 sometimes  days  before  the  Since  being  searched  in  degrading 
 conditions,  hateful  bear  witness  to  the  Israeli  occupation. 
 The  Israeli  army  justified  the  publication  of  barriers  to 
 the  main  roads  in  the  Palestinian  territories  to  prevent 
 Palestinians  from  the  implementation  of  the  attacks  in  Israel 
 or  in  settlements.  According  to  the  expert  in  military  affairs 
 in  the  channel's  tenth  Israeli  special,  Alon  Ben  David,  the 
 situation  in  southern  Iraq  is  similar  to  some  extent  the 
 situation  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza  Strip.  He  added,  "If 
 we  have  followed  the  fighting  in  the  cities  during  the  last 
 two  days,  many  similarities  observe  what  has  happened  here 
 during  the  process  of  +  the  fence  protecting  +"  carried 
 out  by  Israel  in  the  spring  of  2002,  which  was  re-occupation 
 of  almost  all  the  West  Bank.  According  to  Shlomo  booby-trapped 
 car  wish  that  the  suicide  bomb  attack  Saturday  in  the  area 
 of  Najaf,  which  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  four  American 
 soldiers,  explains  the  tragedy  Monday  when  American  soldiers 
 opened  fire  on  a  civilian  car  apparently  refused  to  stop, 
 despite  warnings.  He  added  "When  soldiers,  could  not  distinguish 
 between  friend  the  enemy,  it  is  difficult  to  avoid  such 
 problems."  According  to  Ben-David  that  American  soldiers  "fear 
 and  mistrust,  because  they  feel  that  every  person  who  could 
 become  a  potential  suicide  ",  reminding  that  Israeli  soldiers 
 last  time  to  with  such  threats.  He  added  that  one  solution 
 lies  in  the  promotion  and  protection  of  soldiers  to  barriers. 
 He  says,  "If  the  protection  of  soldiers,  both  through  cement 
 blocks  or  iron  dust,  behave  more  careful.  If  they  are  at 
 risk,  it  is  natural,  to  act  without  thinking."  He  added 
 "should  be  given  to  the  second  additional  troops  to  respond." 
 According  to  the  wish  that  the  mistake  committed  by  American 
 soldiers  demonstrate  the  political  level  to  the  gravity  of 
 the  task  of  British-American  alliance  aimed  at  "win  the  hearts 
 and  minds  of  the  Iraqis.  He  added  "it  is  hard  to  important

 still  control  the  distribution  of  these  waters  under  the 
 auspices  of  the  British-American  alliance  forces,  which  seeks 
 to  delivery  to  40  thousand  people  living  in  the  region. 
 Giving  the  director  of  the  hospital  in  the  city,  Mohamed 
 al-Ansari  displeasure  of  relieving  the  distribution  of  water, 
 in  his  speech  to  Agence  France-Presse  on  the  opening  of 
 the  pipeline  runs  at  a  distance  of  2.5  km  coming  from  Kuwaiti 
 Umm  Qasr.  It  was  a  lesson  he  arrived  in  the  Kuwaiti  water 
 pipeline  network  to  2.7  million  liters  of  water  per  day, 
 which  is  supposed  to  be  sufficient  quantity  of  urgent  needs 
 of  the  population.  Water  is  being  mobilized  water  tanks  in 
 the  distribution  of  water  in  various  districts  in  Umm  Qasr. 
 The  water  of  up  to  the  city  before  the  start  of  the  Iraqi 
 war  over  the  Internet,  originating  in  Basra,  which  was  besieged 
 by  British-American  alliance  forces  today.  But  once  it  enters 
 a  tank  of  water  to  live  up  to  set  aside  by  the  population 
 live  seeks  all  of  them  to  obtain  its  share  of  water  by 
 others.  According  to  the  director  of  the  hospital  that  "people 
 want  to  force  more  water  is  to  obtain  what  it  wants,"  pointing 
 out  that  "some  drivers  intend  to  sell  water  they  are  charged 
 to  distribute  it."  He  pointed  out  that  the  hospital,  which 
 is  working  only  hospital  in  the  city,  "totally  free  of  water, 
 but  did  not  get  a  thousand  liters  and  exhausted  all  quantity." 
 He  told  the  British  forces  in  the  matter,  "We  have  received 
 a  reply  yet."  Mohamed  al-Ansari  relieving  believes  that  it 
 would  be  preferable  to  the  town's  water  reservoir  will  be 
 mobilized  available  instead  of  being  distributed  by  tanks, 
 to  reach  regular  home  through  a  network  of  Umm  Qasr.  He 
 pointed  out  that  it  could  be  in  a  timely  manner  to  codify 
 water  at  a  rate  of  2  hours  a  day.  And  reduced  British

 Paul  Stanley  told  Agence  France  Presse  that  "more  than  2 
 million  liters  would  amount  to  Umm  Qasr,  but  some  technical 
 barriers."  He  pointed  out  that  the  flow  of  pipe  coming  from 
 Kuwaiti  territory  led  to  the  arrival  of  half  a  million  liters 
 of  water  only  to  the  Umm  Qasr,  pointing  out  that  the  situation 
 will  improve  in  the  coming  days.  However,  remains  the  situation 
 in  Umm  Qasr,  which  have  resorted  to  some  10,000  Iraqis, 
 according  to  the  hospital's  director,  better  than  in  other 
 parts  of  southern  Iraq.  Until  the  north  of  the  city,  and 
 by  up  to  Al-Zubair  Basra,  a  large  number  of  Iraqis  in  order 
 to  obtain  water  from  the  pool  consisted  of  small  water  leaked 
 from  a  canal  factory.  A  woman  from  Al-Zubair  we  use  it

 Registry  Asaad  Abboud  Cairo,  4-1  (AFP)  -  The  Arab  League 
 Secretary  General  Amr  Moussa  stressed  the  need  to  "review 
 of  the  Arab  order  after  failing  to  deal  with  issues  of 
 Iraq  and  Palestine  but  reforming  the  system  raises  concerns 
 about  the  return  of  political  polarization  in  the  form  of 
 axes,  to  the  Arab  world  because  of  severe  about  the  attitudes 
 of  divisive  issues.  Moussa  said  today  that  "the  failure  of" 
 Arab  system  existing  in  dealing  with  problems  of  Iraq  and 
 Palestine  "imperative  need  to  be  reviewed,  saying  that"  the 
 Palestinian  resistance  and  Iraqi  require  it.  "  It  also  confirmed 
 the  existence  of  "a  clear  division  of  Arab  comes  at  the 
 time  is  very,  very  serious"  or  in  conjunction  with  the  war 
 in  Iraq  and  the  continuation  of  the  crisis  in  the  Palestinian 
 issue.  Moussa  drew  criticism  and  to  the  Arab  states  because 
 it  has  not  been  able  to  live  up  to  the  level  of  responsibility 
 and  Challenges  ",  saying  that  "all  this  must  make  us  look 
 at  the  Arab  regime  serious  political  and  security  ".  However, 
 claim  Moussa  reforms  which  are  in  the  wake  of  the  invitation 
 of  Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  of  the  day  before  yesterday 
 to  develop  "operational  mechanisms"  to  establish  an  Arab  collective 
 security  developed  kept  pace  with  the  spirit  of  the  times

 member  of  the  commission  on  national  security  in  the  Shura 
 Council  raised  the  Al-Saeed  told  Agence  France  Presse  that 
 the  university  "weak  entity  need  a  new  mechanism,  but  this 
 is  not  possible  because  the  conditions  ahead  in  the  region 
 will  further  weakening  of  the  Unified  Arab."  He  added  that 
 "a  new  system  will  be  in  the  post-war  Iraq  would  be  appointed 
 as  governor  of  the  United  States,  which  will  be  wholly  partisan 
 pressure  on  others,  particularly  Syria."  He  said  "there  will 
 be  altered,  the  first  is  an  absolute  further  United  States 
 under  the  leadership  of  Iraq,  along  with  Gulf  states,  while 
 rejecting  dependence  second  will  be  carried  out  by  Egypt's 
 leadership,  which  will  restore  the  acute  phase  of  polarization 
 to  the  Arab  world."  He  pointed  out  the  possibility  of  similar 
 to  the  return  of  the  Hashemite  union  because  it  is  contained 
 in  the  event  that  will  be  able  to  absorb  the  process  of

 that  the  union  put  Hashemite  mid-1950s  between  Iraq  and  Jordan, 
 solid,  with  Lebanon  and  Saudi  Arabia  to  deal  with  Egypt

 claim  of  a  mechanism  for  political  or  security  Arab  system 
 is  not  possible  at  present  because  there  is  no  basis  for

 "The  old  but  renewed  calls  for  reform  immediately  after  collision 
 with  a  problem"  and  he  wondered  how  "to  build  a  political 
 mechanism  with  differing  or  contradictory  attitudes  towards 
 Iraq,  which  is  the  largest  guide  to  the  absence  of  any 
 joint  action  ?"  Serious  considered  that  "any  currently  qualified 
 non-Arab  joint  action  (...)  mechanisms  did  not  create  a  vacuum 
 but  derived  from  the  culmination  of  a  realistic  economic

 By  Stefan  Smith  (with  photo)  Halabja  (Iraq)  4-1  (AFP)  - 
 American  Special  Forces  of  the  Task  Force  confirmed  today 
 that  a  joint  operation  of  these  forces  with  the  Kurds  against 
 a  group  allegedly  linked  to  local  rule  in  northern  Iraq 
 were  successful  and  that  preliminary  investigations  indicate 
 its  activity  in  the  production  of  chemical  weapons  precursors. 
 In  a  rare  meeting  with  the  press,  he  said  seven  officers 
 of  those  forces  that  the  group  of  supporters  of  Islam  has 
 been  "eliminated"  even  if  many  of  its  fighters  fled  across 
 the  border  into  neighbouring  Iran.  He  said  one  of  those 
 officers  in  a  press  talk  in  the  town  of  Halabja  located 
 south-east  of  Iraqi  Kurdistan,  "was  a  brilliant  success.  During 
 the  day-and-a  -  half  day  had  been  uprooted  and  the  elimination 
 of  a  terrorist  organization  was  governed  by  its  grip  on 
 the  region  ".  The  officer  added:  "great  confrontations.  It 
 was  not  easy  to  overcome  the  supporters  of  Islam  and  the 
 base."  and  rejected  all  military  officers  who  had  their  clothes, 
 disclosure  of  names.  Officers  reported,  quoting  "evidence  available" 
 for  the  occurrence  of  "several  hundreds  of  casualties  among 
 supporters  of  Islam.  It  is  estimated  that  about  700  members 
 of  the  group  believed  that  between  75  to  100  of  whom  were 
 from  al-Qaeda  members  who  were  fighting  in  Afghanistan.  Dozens 
 of  American  Special  Forces  were  sent  by  air  to  the  Kurdish 
 self-rule  areas  in  northern  Iraq  to  help  the  Patriotic  Union 
 of  Kurdistan  defeat  Islam  supporters  group  that  emerged  in 
 late  2001  and  imposed  a  system  similar  to  the  Taliban  regime 
 and  drew  their  fingers  in  a  number  of  suicide  bombings  and 
 assassinations.  The  group  received  the  name  of  the  American 
 Secretary  of  State  Colin  Powell,  foreign  minister  in  a  speech 
 before  the  Security  Council  last  February,  where  he  talked 
 about  the  possibility  of  the  Group  of  the  so-called  weapons 
 of  mass  destruction  have  been  delivered  to  Iraqi  President 
 Saddam  Hussein  to  the  al-Qaeda  network  led  by  Osama  bin 
 Laden.  Participated  in  the  attack  on  Islam  supporters  between 
 eight  to  ten  thousands  of  Kurdish  fighters  (  )  contributed 
 with  American  special  forces  "less  than  one  percent  of  this 
 issue  ",  according  to  the  officers  by  the  Americans.  He 
 said  that  the  officers  of  initial  inspections  in  the  areas 
 of  supporters  of  Islam,  which  was  captured  last  week,  following 
 an  attack  from  six  main  supported  by  fighter  aircraft  type 
 a  giant  C-130  type  I  launchers  and  52  of  the  total  land 
 area  amounting  to  about  400  square  kilometres,  which  resulted 
 in  a  valuable  evidence.  He  said  one  of  the  officers  of 
 the  things  that  have  been  found  at  the  site  for  me  to 
 confirm  the  existence  of  activities  for  the  production  of 
 chemical  or  biological  weapons.  a  large  part  of  evidence 
 under  the  debris  and  explore  the  site  is  continuing,  "he 
 said,  adding  that  physical  evidence  and  a  model  of  soil 
 were  sent  to  the  United  States  for  analysis.  Sources  said 
 the  National  Democratic  Party  of  Kurdistan  also  find  that 
 they  are  a  number  of  foreign  passports  and  regulations,  addresses 
 and  phone  numbers  in  the  United  States  and  Europe,  which 
 said  that  she  supported  the  statements  that  supporters  of 
 Islam  as  a  threat  to  international  and  not  only  locally. 
 Despite  optimistic  their  knowledge,  the  American  officers  responded 
 cautiously  to  a  question  on  the  reports  which  indicated  that 
 the  fighters,  dozens  of  supporters  of  Islam,  in  addition 
 to  some  of  the  leaders  of  the  group,  had  fled  to  Iran. 
 Officer  said  "We  know  that  a  number  of  people  were  able 
 to  flee  across  the  border  to  Iran,"  he  added,  however,  diplomatic 
 tone  to  the  border  are  a  long  series  of  mountain  snow  married 
 "to  facilitate  their  entry  into  force  little  control  ".  Iran 
 denies  the  allegations  that  they  support  the  supporters  of 
 Islam.  The  group  will  allow  the  overthrow  of  their  respective 
 regions,  American  special  forces  and  Kurdish  National  Democratic 
 Party  (NDP)  in  those  areas  of  focus  on  plans  to  open  the 
 northern  front  in  the  war  on  Iraq.  However,  the  special 
 forces  officers  refused  to  discuss  the  future  operations.

 General  Amr  Moussa  stressed  the  need  to  "review  of  the  Arab 
 order  after  failing  to  deal  with  issues  of  Iraq  and  Palestine 
 but  reforming  the  system  raises  concerns  about  the  return 
 of  political  polarization  in  the  form  of  axes,  to  the  Arab 
 world  because  of  severe  about  the  attitudes  of  divisive  issues. 
 Moussa  said  today  that  "the  failure  of"  Arab  system  existing 
 in  dealing  with  problems  of  Iraq  and  Palestine  "imperative 
 need  to  be  reviewed,  saying  that"  the  Palestinian  resistance 
 and  Iraqi  require  it.  "  It  also  confirmed  the  existence 
 of  "a  clear  division  of  Arab  comes  at  the  time  is  very, 
 very  serious"  or  in  conjunction  with  the  war  in  Iraq  and 
 the  continuation  of  the  crisis  in  the  Palestinian  issue. 
 Moussa  drew  criticism  and  to  the  Arab  states  because  it 
 has  not  been  able  to  live  up  to  the  level  of  responsibility 
 and  Challenges  ",  saying  that  "all  this  must  make  us  look 
 at  the  Arab  regime  serious  political  and  security  ".  Moussa 
 expressed,  in  an  interview  with  the  newspaper  "The  Middle 
 East"  Today,  disappointed  that  the  "Arabs  are  not  a  single 
 position  if  it  had  taken  the  position  of  the  war  and  to 
 conceal  it  is  now  the  question  is  not  required  and  other 
 non-Secretary  of  Health  (...)  Arabs  in  the  case  of  weakness 
 as  long  as  they  are  Thus,  this  was  reflected  in  the  Arab 
 League  and  the  future  of  the  Arab  entity  ".  He  was  also 
 charged  with  "Arab  forces"  did  not  mention  by  name  as  "does 
 not  want  to  be  no  doubt  the  activation  of  the  whole  issue 
 is  not  a  simple  one  degree  or  activated  (...)  but  the  university 
 itself  after  the  division  serious"  and  Asked  "Are  you  will 
 continue  to  be  Arabs  or  not  to  be  re-examine  the  whole 
 Arab  order  ?"  He  went  on  to  say  that  there  was  a  "Arab 
 states  if  the  war  and  helped  to  prepare  them  for  specific 
 assumed  by  the  end  of  the  resistance,  however,  all  accounts 
 were  reversed."  Moussa  pointed  out  that  "as  secretary-general 
 of  the  university  is  not  interested  in  that  remain  or  not 
 remain,  but  on  how  to  re-arranged  ",  saying"  not  being  in 
 another  organization  or  a  new  system.  "  Finally,  it  was 
 the  second  world  war  to  mark  the  end  of  the  League  of 
 Nations  and  the  beginning  of  the  United  Nations  may  be  Iraqi 
 war  or  failure  of  both  Iraqi  and  Palestinian  signalled  that 
 meet  and  discuss  a  solution  we  must  think  about  this.  " 
 However,  claim  Moussa  reforms  which  are  in  the  wake  of  the 
 invitation  of  Egyptian  President  Hosni  Mubarak  of  the  day 
 before  yesterday  to  develop  "operational  mechanisms"  to  establish 
 an  Arab  collective  security  developed  kept  pace  with  the 
 spirit  of  the  times  "met  with  scepticism  by  a  number  of 
 analysts.  It  was  a  member  of  the  commission  on  national 
 security  in  the  Shura  Council  raised  the  Al-Saeed  told  Agence 
 France  Presse  that  the  university  "weak  entity  need  a  new 
 mechanism,  but  this  is  not  possible  because  the  conditions 
 ahead  in  the  region  will  further  weakening  of  the  Unified 
 Arab."  He  added  that  "a  new  system  will  be  in  the  post-war 
 Iraq  would  be  appointed  as  governor  of  the  United  States, 
 which  will  be  wholly  partisan  pressure  on  others,  particularly 
 Syria."  He  said  "there  will  be  altered,  the  first  is  an 
 absolute  further  United  States  under  the  leadership  of  Iraq, 
 along  with  Gulf  states,  while  second  will  be  full,  rejecting 
 all  forms  of  dependency  (...)  which  will  restore  the  acute 
 phase  of  polarization  to  the  Arab  world."  For  his  part, 
 he  said,  a  researcher  at  the  centre  of  Al-Ahram  Strategic 
 Studies,  Imad  Gad  told  press  that  the  claim  of  a  mechanism 
 for  political  or  security  Arab  system  is  not  possible  at 
 present  because  there  is  no  basis  for  joint  action  between 
 the  states  of  the  22  state  ".  He  added:  "The  old  but  renewed 
 calls  for  reform  immediately  after  collision  with  a  problem" 
 and  he  wondered  how  "to  build  a  political  mechanism  with 
 differing  or  contradictory  attitudes  towards  Iraq,  which  is 
 the  largest  guide  to  the  absence  of  any  joint  action  ?" 
 Serious  considered  that  "any  currently  qualified  non-Arab  joint 
 action  (...)  mechanisms  did  not  create  a  vacuum  but  derived 
 from  the  culmination  of  a  realistic  economic  and  political 
 interests,  which  could  not  obtain  ",  adding  that"  talking 
 about  mechanisms  would  be  premature.  "  Mi  /  An  /

 aides  developments  on  the  battlefield.  In  that  guilty:  Ronald

 refused  to  comment  on  the  conduct  of  military  operations 
 in  this  regard  to  the  Pentagon  spokesmen  transformers  questions

 new  details  on  the  "torture"  suffered  by  the  British  and 
 American  forces  want  to  help.  The  aim  is  to  convince  the 
 American  public  opinion  in  pursuing  scenes  of  daily  shelling 
 and  atrocities  that  permeates  the  fighting,  the  American  army 
 in  Iraq  is  waging  a  war  of  liberation  effectively.  But  the 
 message  that  it  wants  the  American  administration's  passing, 
 are  facing  great  difficulties  with  the  proliferation  of  senior 
 officers  press  statements  calling  for  radical  reform  of  the 
 strategy  adopted  before  the  unexpected  resistance  by  the  Iraqi 
 forces  and  the  emergence  of  any  signs  of  American  forces

 problems  the  impression  that  the  war,  which  will  be  strengthened 
 short  statements  made  by  several  senior  officials  in  the 
 Bush  administration  before  the  start  of  the  conflict.  Sources 
 close  to  the  president  that  Bush  "dissatisfied"  of  the  questions 
 posed  by  the  media  in  this  context,  he  said,  pointing  out 
 that  Bush  Fleischer  appeal  have  consistently  difficult  war.

 employed  by  the  United  Nations  presented  a  new  generation 
 of  Iraqi  children  psychological  damage  could  not  be  dealt 
 with  in  the  war  would  bring  more  violence  and  destruction 
 to  the  people  suffer  for  some  time  under  the  suffering. 
 He  said  Marc  Vergara,  the  spokesperson  for  the  United  Nations 
 Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  neighbouring  Kuwait  in  the  world 
 as  a  whole  dispersion  in  a  plot  ".  He  said,  "in  Iraq, 
 which  has  seen  three  wars  in  less  than  20  years,  since 
 half  of  the  children  do  not  go  to  school  and  12  years 
 of  economic  sanctions  (imposed  by  the  United  Nations)  denied 
 them  hundreds  of  necessary  supplies,  the  situation  really 
 is  a  cause  for  concern."  He  examined  Vergara  psychological 
 by  these  crises,  particularly  in  the  bloody  Balkan  war  in 
 the  1990  s,  which  he  said  that  it  was  left  to  the  many 
 children  "a  lasting  impact  -  it  has  suffered  lasting  psychological 
 diseases,  where  they  were  witnesses  to  the  horrors  of  war 
 ".  UNICEF  fears  that  some  500  thousand  Iraqi  children  need 
 to  assist  psychological,  Vergara  said  he  hoped  that  the  team 
 will  be  able  to  cross  the  border  in  the  coming  days,  even 
 if  it  lightning  visits  during  the  day.  Shan  other  staff 
 members  of  the  United  Nations,  the  international  body  to 
 prohibit  Vergara  UNICEF  team  to  enter  Iraq  to  improve  the 
 security  situation  in  it.  He  said  that  the  first  priority 
 will  be  mental  health  and  to  ensure  that  children  have  access 
 to  sufficient  drinking  water.  Vergara  said:  "The  situation 
 is  becoming  increasingly  urgent  because  the  temperature  rise," 
 adding  "at  the  end  of  the  week  temperature  would  amount 
 to  36  or  37  degrees  Celsius  in  southern  Iraq.  This  will 
 be  worse."  UNICEF  staff  has  just  started  in  the  delivery 
 of  drinking  water,  thanks  to  the  Kuwaiti  company  helped  to 
 provide  for  the  transfer  of  water  tanks  to  the  Iraqis  in 
 the  other  side  of  the  border.  It  was  also  sent  high-protein 
 food  rations,  lie  in  a  further  quantity  weighing  500  tons 
 in  Kuwait,  awaiting  the  green  light  from  officials  of  the 
 United  Nations  relief  personnel  to  return  to  Iraq.  Vergara 
 said  that  the  consignments  from  hospitals  and  medical  centres 
 and  targeting  in  particular  women  and  children.  He  said, 
 "by  nature  are  the  most  vulnerable,  in  addition,  they  (aid) 
 did  not  go  directly  to  them.  Men  who  usually  come  for  water. 
 This  is  why  our  priority  is  the  direct  and  immediate  access 
 for  women  and  children."  Youssef  said  the  Kuwaiti  Red  Crescent 
 organization  "Until  now,  water  distribution  has  been  characterized 
 by  chaos,"  adding  "we  have  approached  local  commanders.  We 
 want  to  bring  food  and  water  for  the  largest  possible  number 
 of  people  ".  UNICEF  says  that  100  thousand  children  are 
 exposed  to  the  fifth  strongly  without  risk  of  disease,  and 
 the  most  contaminated  water  causes  of  death  among  children 
 in  Iraq  last  year.  Has  developed  a  new  generation  of  Iraqi 
 children  in  especially  difficult  circumstances  and  sometimes 
 miserable.  The  war  with  Iran  between  1980-1988  Gulf  War  in 
 1991  following  the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait,  and  the  ongoing 
 war  now,  left  their  impact.  Not  only  a  few  relief  programmes 
 to  reduce  the  impact  of  economic  sanctions  imposed  on  Baghdad 
 since  .1991war.  He  said  Iraq  in  January  last  year,  more 
 than  1.7  million  Iraqis  died  as  a  direct  result  of  sanctions. 
 The  United  States  accuses  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein's 
 regime  of  non-compliance  with  United  Nations  resolutions  on 
 prohibited  weapons,  and  thus  not  to  the  lifting  of  sanctions. 
 According  to  UNICEF  to  Iraqi  children  suffer  under  suffering. 
 It  is  believed  that  a  quarter  of  Iraqi  children  under  the 
 age  of  five,  suffer  from  malnutrition,  while  threatening  the 
 already  desperate  situation  to  the  war-risk  transfer  of  comprehensive 
 disaster.  The  chairman  of  the  UNICEF  operations  in  Iraq  Carryl

 in  the  interest  of  the  children  ".  He  added:  "Without  great

 "Americans  Airlines"  bankruptcy  in  the  last  moment,  thanks 
 to  the  concessions  on  wages,  which  was  approved  by  the  staff, 
 but  the  major  international  airlines  have  so  far  been  unable 
 to  overcome  the  danger  because  of  the  crisis  that  hit  American 
 air  transport  sector.  Two  months  of  arduous  negotiations  at 
 the  end  of  the  company's  management  announced  that  it  reached 
 with  all  workers  unions  in  the  company  to  agreements  to 
 reduce  the  size  of  the  wages  of  a  total  of  $1.8  billion 
 dollars  annually.  This  assessment,  which  constitutes  more  than 
 20%  of  the  bloc,  encompassing  all  workers  with  wage  reduction 
 in  pay  between  15  and  25  percent,  according  to  the  different 
 groups.  pension  without  two  of  the  president  of  the  company's 
 board  of  directors  by  33%  will  relinquish  his  Ka,  as  well 
 as  any  other.  "Preliminary  agreements,  which  concluded  with 
 all  trade  unions  must  obtain  the  approval  of  the  workers 
 themselves  in  the  coming  weeks.  Although  some  analysts  final 
 does  not  exclude  the  possibility  of  surprise,  is  expected 
 to  be  generally  workers  to  vote  in  favour  of  these  agreements, 
 as  the  only  alternative  is  immediate  bankruptcy.  bankruptcy 
 usually  lead  to  greater  sacrifices  for  jobs  and  wages  also 
 showed  a  bankrupt  company  "United  Airlines"  and  "U  S.  British." 
 It  welcomed  the  administration  of  the  "Americans  Airlines" 
 position  of  trade  unions,  but  stressed  that  the  more  difficult, 
 particularly  the  still  before  the  company.  The  two  "With 
 these  agreements  are  an  important  step  in  the  march  determined 
 to  continue  (...)  the  financial  situation  is  still  weak  and 
 prospects  remains  uncertain  because  of  the  war  in  Iraq  different 
 economic  conditions,  which  weigh  on  the  aviation  sector." 
 It  shares  many  analysts  caution  that  the  company's  management. 
 They  argue  that  the  company  had  avoided  bankruptcy  at  the 
 time  being,  but  its  viability  remains  pending  as  long  as 
 they  did  not  witness  the  air  transport  sector,  which  is 
 already  difficult  recovery  in  the  short  and  medium  terms 
 with  the  war  in  Iraq  and  the  risks  of  new  terrorist  attacks. 
 Investment  company  felt  "Lehmann"  in  a  note  published  today, 
 Tuesday,  the  economy  in  wages  and  reduce  huge  other  expenditures 
 (a  total  of  four  billion  dollars  annually)  mitigate  exfoliate 
 much  possibility  that  the  company  but  we  believe  it  is  early 
 stressed  that  the  +  Americans  Airlines  +  spared  once  and 
 for  all.  "  The  company,  says  Philippe  analyst  credit  classification 
 "Standard  and  that  the"  concessions  on  wages  of  $1.8  billion 
 is  supposed  to  allow  for  the  long-term  role  in  reducing 
 losses  significantly,  but  is  expected  to  continue  +  Americans 
 Airlines  +  in  a  high  debt  and  traffic  under  difficult  conditions 
 at  the  level  of  revenues.  "  The  analyst  adds  that  the  company 
 "is  supposed  to  avoid  bankruptcy  requirement  should  not  be 
 further  aggravated  by  the  repercussions  of  the  war  in  Iraq 
 or  terrorism  significantly."  The  company  expected  "Goldman 
 Sachs"  investments  to  "help  wage  concessions  to  the  company 
 to  make  profits,  but  once  again  to  stimulate  demand"  only.
