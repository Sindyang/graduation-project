 here  on  China's  "Guangming  Daily"  published  on  the  2nd  "arms 
 sales  to  Iraq  Russia  and  the  United  States  insist  the  word 
 "signed  article,  which  is  transmitted  as  follows  :  US  and 
 British  forces  near  a  war  against  Iraq,  the  US  State  Department 
 spokesman  suddenly  accused  Russia  prohibited  military  equipment 
 sales  to  Iran,  the  losses  suffered  by  allied  forces,  the 
 Russian  side  to  immediately  stop  arms  sales.  Russia  has  strongly 
 denied  US  accusations.  The  US  war  in  former  British  military 
 analysts  believe  that  more  than  10  years  after  the  Gulf 
 War  and  the  sanctions  have  crippled  the  Iraqi  army  combat 
 capability,  sweeping  coalition  will  be  directly  from  Baghdad. 
 The  Iraqi  army  attacks  not  only  to  US  and  British  forces 
 carried  out  a  strong  and  effective  resistance,  and  were  not 
 small  losses,  which  is  well  beyond  their  expectations.  The 
 war,  the  US  and  British  forces  continued  Iraqi  missiles  hit 
 civilian  targets,  precision-guided  bombs  "floating"  to  the 
 Iranian  oil  refineries,  or  even  two  British  warplanes  have 
 also  become  victims.  The  Americans  believe  that  this  is  because 
 of  the  Iraqi  people  to  use  the  Russian  production  of  radio 
 interference  and  the  "smart"  bombs  run  high.  The  Pentagon 
 and  even  named  the  two  locations  such  weapons  sales  to  Iran 
 of  the  Russian  company,  "Tula"  instrument  design  bureau  and 
 Moscow  Aviation  Equipment  Company.  The  Americans  thought  "Tula" 
 the  company's  sales  to  Iran  substantial  anti-tank  missiles, 
 the  Moscow  Aviation  Company  equipment  sales  to  Iran  at  least 
 five  radio  interference  systems  and  1,000  night  vision  equipment. 
 Pre-fighting,  the  US  side  has  repeatedly  linked  with  Russia 
 on  arms  sales  to  Iran  and  Russia.  Russia  to  the  US  side, 
 there  is  no  violation  of  United  Nations  resolutions  arms 
 sales  to  Iran.  Even  on  18  March,  the  first  two  days  of 
 fighting  between  the  two  sides  also  on  the  issue.  Compared 
 with  the  1991  Gulf  War,  Iraqi  troops  in  the  field  performance 
 "sentenced  if  they  are  ",  has  made  the  United  States  and 
 Britain  was  stunned.  Fraud  fell,  suicide  attacks,  guerrilla 
 warfare  and  regular  army  resistance,  they  are  not.  The  US-British 
 joint  preliminary  fight  with  Iraq  is  not  much  cheaper.  The 
 Americans  are  furious  that  Russia  and  Iraq  have  been  manufacturing 
 advanced  weapons.  The  United  States  and  Russia  does  not  admit 
 that  the  allegations.  March  24,  the  United  States  and  Russia 
 leaders  telephone  conversation,  Bush  raised  the  issue  to  Putin, 
 Putin  again  refuted  this.  Moscow  Aviation  Equipment  manager 
 pointed  out  that  the  Americans  are  going  to  find  mistakes 
 on  the  battlefield  "scapegoats  ".  He  said  that  the  company 
 have  indeed  been  radio  interference  in  the  production  of 
 advanced  equipment,  including  GPS  satellite  positioning  system 
 /  GLONASS  interference  equipment  and  large  quantities  exported, 
 but  not  signed  any  contract  with  Iran.  The  company  and  even 
 the  media  saying  that  their  products  it  is  the  largest  buyer 
 of  the  United  States,  the  Americans  deal  with  the  products 
 manufactured  in  order  to  purchase  the  equipment.  But  it  seems 
 that  they  are  in  the  study  does  not  make  progress.  As  a 
 result  of  the  United  States  that  such  products  on  the  battlefield 
 may  pose  a  threat  by  Allied  Dui  Meiying,  the  United  States 
 and  Russia  senior  diplomats  stationed  in  the  company  had 
 bought  all  products,  including  spare  parts,  but  was  rejected. 
 Manager  Antonov  said  that  Iraq  does  not  exclude  the  jamming 
 equipment,  as  technically,  it  is  not  difficult  to  production 
 of  such  equipment,  the  Iraqi  people  themselves  can  also  be 
 created,  but  the  effectiveness  of  such  equipment  is  limited. 
 "Tula"  instrument  design  bureau  said  that  the  American  accusations 
 are  purely  "nonsense  ".  He  said  that  Iraq  use  of  the  arms 
 purchase  of  30  to  40  years  ago,  mainly  firearms.  American 
 companies  do  have  a  deal  with  their  weapons,  but  the  Iraqi 
 people  will  be  impossible.  For  example,  they  produced  "armor" 
 and  "the  Michifuru"  precision-guided  missiles  to  prevent  any 
 aircraft  close  to  the  United  States,  their  production  of 
 precision-guided  anti-tank  missiles  could  be  destroyed  within 
 25  kilometres  of  any  target,  but  they  did  not  have  any 
 arms  deals  with  Iraq.  If  the  Iraqi  people  with  some  of 
 their  products,  and  not  to  buy  them.  Russia  "Izvestia"  revealed 
 an  interesting  circumstances.  Pre-fighting,  a  group  of  soldiers 
 NATO  countries  were  invited  to  a  Radio  Moscow  research  center. 
 They  have  developed  a  master  guests  display  products  like 
 size  notebook  computers.  Inventors  said  that  the  products 
 were  used  for  peaceful  purposes,  stars  study  the  effects 
 of  radiation  exposure  on  the  earth's  atmosphere.  But  experiments 
 have  shown  that  the  product  has  a  complementary  functions, 
 m-diameter  could  be  several  tens  of  thousands  of  all  electronic 
 equipment  have  strong  interference.  As  an  academic  exchanges, 
 the  Russian  military  as  a  gift  to  the  west  a  few  dozen 
 "notebooks  ".  It  is  learned  that  these  products  are  transported 
 to  Iraq  to  conduct  further  tests.  But  who  did  not  know 
 whether  the  Iraqis  have  such  products.  US  and  British  against 
 Iraq  by  the  international  war  against  the  majority  of  countries, 
 Russia  has  also  taken  the  position  of  anti-war.  Relations 
 between  Russia  and  the  United  States  in  recent  years  made 
 considerable  progress,  the  Iraqi  issue  is  rare  in  recent 
 years  in  the  relations  between  the  two  countries  fail  to 
 find  a  common  language  of  the  subject.  Carefully  found,  although 
 Russian  society  and  anti-American  Anti-war  high  voice,  but 
 is  still  in  their  efforts  to  maintain  top  had  been  reached 
 between  the  US-Russian  partnership  in  the  Iraq  issue  will 
 not  affect  the  differences  between  the  two  sides  in  the 
 wider  areas  of  cooperation.  In  Iraq,  the  dispute  between 
 Russia  and  the  United  States  may  also  occur,  but  subject 
 to  the  dictates  of  their  own  interests,  and  their  cooperation 
 will  continue.

 News  Analysis:  Powell's  visit  to  Turkey  and  Turkish-US  relations 
 Reporters  Huai  Chengbo  and  Wang  Qiang  US  Secretary  of  State 
 Colin  Powell  arrived  in  Ankara,  April  1  on  the  night,  a 
 one-day  visit  to  Turkey.  In  Iraq  war  entered  a  critical 
 stage,  Powell  visited  Turkey,  the  intention  of  causing  widely 
 speculated.  Turkish  Foreign  Ministry  on  the  afternoon  of  1 
 April  issued  a  communique  said,  Powell  will  discuss  with 
 Turkish  leaders  relations  between  the  two  countries  and  Iraq 
 war.  Both  NATO  allies  Turkey  and  the  United  States  and  a 
 strategic  partner,  the  fundamental  interests  of  the  two  countries 
 often  go  hand  in  hand.  However,  the  two  sides  in  Iraq  war, 
 there  are  contradictions,  aggravating  the  tense  relations. 
 Former  Turkish  President  Suleyman  Demirel  that  Turkey  is  now 
 second  only  to  France  for  the  US  President  George  W.  Bush 
 feel  annoyed  most  allies.  Turkish-US  relations  to  the  first 
 step,  it  is  the  fundamental  interests  of  the  two  countries 
 in  the  collision.  "Road  does  not  seek  to  be."  Turkey  is 
 on  a  range  of  issues  in  the  United  States  said  that  "no 
 ".  First,  Turkey  strongly  opposes  the  United  States  to  use 
 force  against  Iraq.  Bush  announced  in  July  2002  must  not 
 hesitate  at  all  costs  since  overthrowing  the  Iraqi  regime, 
 three  Turkish  government  has  clearly  indicated  that  they  would 
 not  support  using  force  to  resolve  the  Iraq  issue,  stressing 
 that  the  use  of  force  against  a  sovereign,  independent  state 
 is  a  UN  Security  Council  authorization.  Turkish  Chief  of 
 Staff  Heuse  Wim  Kok  said  that  Turkey  is  not  a  public  opinion 
 poll  showed  that  94%  of  the  opposition  to  the  use  of  force, 
 but  100%  opposition  to  the  use  of  force.  The  United  States 
 2,  Turkey  rejected  the  deployment  of  62,000  people  in  its 
 territory  against  the  US  to  open  Iraq's  northern  front.  Led 
 by  former  prime  minister,  the  government  was  forced  by  the 
 strong  US  pressure,  the  United  States  has  been  forced  to 
 agree  to  this  request,  but  ultimately  rejected  by  the  parliament. 
 The  Pentagon  orchestrated  by  the  northern  front  project  abortion. 
 The  Bush  administration's  second-guess  Turkey  had  been  unable 
 to  do  the  work  of  ruling  party  members.  And  the  Turkish 
 officials  have  criticized  the  United  States  should  assume 
 the  responsibility  of  the  US  media  pointed  out  that  Turkey 
 launched  a  smear  campaign,  greatly  hurt  the  Turkish  national 
 sentiments,  leading  to  approach  the  shaken  members  voted  against 
 it.  3,  Turkey  to  the  United  States  on  Iraq's  expulsion, 
 the  officer  fell  on  deaf  ears.  Iraq  after  the  outbreak  of 
 war,  the  United  States  has  asked  the  Iraqi  diplomat  expelled 
 dozens  of  countries.  Erdogan  Turkish  new  prime  minister  was 
 "so  outright  it  ",  did  not  need  to  respond  to  this.  In 
 addition,  the  Iraqi  ambassador  to  Turkey  for  some  time  in 
 the  past  Saleh  has  been  very  active  in  Ankara  to  publicize 
 the  position  of  the  government  of  Iraq  and  to  the  United 
 States  is  very  annoyed  to  vent  their  anger  on  the  government 
 of  Turkey.  4,  Turkey  insisted  that  the  Turkish  troops  entered 
 northern  Iraq  to  open  airspace  fighters  linked  to  the  United 
 States.  March  23,  Bush  indicated  that  "The  United  States 
 expects  the  Turkish  people  not  to  enter  northern  Iraq.  They 
 know  that  our  policy,  and  this  is  a  firm  policy  ".  Although 
 the  government  Erdogan  made  a  compromise,  but  still  insists 
 that  it  has  the  right  to  decide  if  necessary,  sending  troops 
 to  northern  Iraq.  Sources  said  that  Powell's  visit  to  Turkey 
 is  intended  to  kill  two  birds  with  one  stone,  repairing 
 relations  with  Turkey,  to  persuade  Turkey  "more  active"  support 
 for  the  United  States'  Iran-Iraq  war.  While  the  opening  of 
 the  United  States  warplanes  Turkish  airspace,  but  the  United 
 States  believes  that  it  is  not  enough.  There  are  reports 
 that  Powell's  visit  will  probably  put  forward  new  demands. 
 What  is,  to  be  seen.

 to  demonstrate  effectiveness,  confirmed  the  latest  research 
 results:  Before  the  surgery  if  using  Yunnan  white  medicinal 
 powder,  surgery  may  significantly  reduce  the  loss  of  blood. 
 Yunnan  white  medicinal  powder  group  Natural  Medicine  Research 
 Institute  Director  high  Sung  Kun  recently  disclosed  to  reporters, 
 researchers  spent  two  years,  in  Beijing,  Shanghai  and  Wuhan,

 there  was  no  danger  of  thrombus  formation.  According  to  statistics, 
 three  days  before  the  surgery  can  reduce  bleeding  1501350 
 ML  using  Yunnan  white  medicinal  powder,  this  is  equivalent 
 to  reduce  the  total  number  of  types  of  surgical  bleeding

 to  the  pharmaceutical  sector.  All  parts  of  China  each  year

 here  on  publication  of  China's  "People's  Daily"  Second  published 
 an  article  entitled  "for  democracy  Remarks  and  non-democratic 
 behaviour  "of  the  article.  The  full  text  follows  :  The  United 
 States  and  Britain  bypassing  the  United  Nations  to  use  force 
 against  Iraq  has  caused  an  uproar  in  the  international  community. 
 The  people  of  the  World  Anti-war  upsurge  Unprecedented  upsurge 
 and  triggering  the  War  Heated  discussions  and  in-depth  reflection: 
 where  to  go  to  international  relations  World  how  to  get 
 out  ?  "to  answer  violence  with  violence"  The  cycle  and  eventually 
 to  peace.  In  accordance  with  the  popular  West  "Theory  on 
 democracy  and  peace  ","  democracy  "is  not  normally  between 
 use  of  force,  and  the"  democratic  and  non-democracies  "easily 
 broke  out  between  the  armed  conflict.  According  to  this  logic, 
 only  to  the  world  "transformation"  into  "democracy"  would 
 be  generally  long-lasting  peace.  The  United  States  and  Britain 
 to  contain  the  use  of  force  against  Iraq  this  logic.  US 
 and  British  on  the  issues  of  democracy,  there  are  two  faces. 
 From  the  international  relations  point  of  view,  they  remained 
 limited  democracy  or  is  not  democratic,  but  they  also  do 
 not  attach  importance  to  international  law  and  the  role  of 
 international  organizations,  often  in  other  countries'  use 
 of  force  or  threat  of  force.  This  phenomenon  is  the  so-called 
 one  of  the  reasons  for  the  imperial  traditions.  Britain  not 
 only  in  modern  times  and  the  establishment  of  a  large  number 
 of  colonial  territories  forcibly  known  as  "not  fall  on"  the 
 great  empire,  but  several  brutal  repression  of  the  people 
 of  the  colony  independence  struggle.  Although  the  United  States 
 had  not  set  up  overseas  colony,  but  in  its  surrounding  the 
 American  region  also  introduced  get  married  Luo  Zhu  Yiyi 
 such  empire-style.  The  United  States  and  Britain  political 
 and  cultural  traditions,  and  the  Law  of  the  jungle  of  social 
 Darwinism  deep-rooted  belief  in  economic  and  social  fields 
 as  competition  is  higher  than  social  equity,  and  egoism  above 
 individual  and  collective  cooperation  in  international  relations 
 is  reflected  in  the  national  egoism  and  power  politics.  Social 
 Darwinism  does  not  recognize  the  People  and  the  relationship 
 between  ethnic  and  racial  equality,  and  in  the  field  of 
 international  relations  is  not  to  recognize  the  relationships 
 between  states  are  equal,  strong  powers  should  dominate  the 
 weak,  should  have  control  over  the  weak.  In  addition  to 
 traditional  social  Darwinism,  excessive  national  egoism  and 
 other  reasons,  the  United  States  and  the  profound  lack  philosophy 
 completely  tradition.  French  scientists  Tocqueville  in  more 
 than  100  years  ago  on  a  sharply  pointed  out:  "The  civilized 
 world  is  not  a  country  like  the  United  States  that  was 
 the  focus  on  the  philosophy  ","  Almost  no  one  to  concentrate 
 on  the  Study  of  Human  Knowledge  in  nature  and  abstract  theory 
 that  part  of  the  ".  Although  it  could  not  believe  that 
 to  avoid  the  correct  official  philosophy  and  subjected  to 
 mislead  the  pros  and  cons,  thinking  it  is  bound  by  one-sided, 
 contradictory  superficial  and  misleading.  The  highlight  of 
 the  American  way  of  thinking  is  simplistic  and  absolute  non-the 
 other,  non-black  or  white,  such  as  "free  world"  and  "non-free 
 world"  and  "democracy"  and  "dictatorship"  and  "Western  civilization" 
 and  "non-Western  civilization"  and  "9.11"  After  the  incident 
 "anti-terrorist"  enemy  lines  and  whether  or  not.  Former  German 
 chancellor  in  its  "with  great  powers"  in  the  book  has  repeatedly 
 criticized  "inherent  in  the  United  States  isolationism  that 
 tend  to  favour  the  non-black  or  white,  one-sided  ethics  to 
 induce  some  Americans  to  all  other  countries  are  also  divided 
 into  two  categories:  one  is  willing  to  succumb  to  bad  leadership 
 of  the  Soviet  Union,  and  the  other  side  in  the  United  States 
 is  good."  Such  simple,  one-sided  and  absolute  generally  can 
 only  be  misleading.  Some  people  in  the  United  States  believes 
 "unipolar  stability  theory"  and  seeking  "peace  under  the  rule 
 of  the  United  States  ",  which  is  in  fact  a  dictatorship 
 in  international  relations.  True  to  bring  lasting  peace  and 
 stability  in  the  world  was  not  a  unipolar  hegemony,  but 
 a  process  of  democratization  in  international  relations  and 
 the  legal  system.  The  trend  of  human  development  not  only 
 in  the  progressive  introduction  of  democracy  and  the  rule 
 of  law,  and  in  international  relations  gradual  introduction 
 of  democracy  and  the  rule  of  law.  At  present,  most  of  the 
 world's  countries  and  people  against  US  and  British  disregard 
 of  international  law,  bypassing  the  United  Nations,  called 
 the  Iraqi  crisis  within  the  framework  of  the  United  Nations, 
 is  the  world  stand  for  the  democratization  of  international 
 relations  and  the  rule  of  law  is  the  strength  of  the  strength 
 to  strength.  Of  course,  the  International  Relations  in  the 
 trial  of  strength  of  democracy  and  non-democratic  forces  will 
 be  a  long-term,  tortuous,  but  the  forces  of  nationalism, 
 democracy  will  prevail  over  democratic  and  authoritarian  unilateralism. 
 swimming  against  the  tide  of  history  will  surely  be  met 
 actors  mockery  and  contempt.

 living  in  Hangzhou  of  a  family  Zhang  Wenyuan  unwritten  rules: 
 Ching  Ming  Festival  every  year  around,  all  of  our  brothers 
 and  sisters  have  to  go  back  home,  Shaoxing  worship  ancestral 
 graves.  Zhang  Wenyuan  seven  brothers  and  sisters,  Shaoxing 
 left  in  the  second  home,  and  the  rest  are  scattered  throughout 
 the  country,  but  the  annual  festival  is  home  to  offer  a 
 sacrifice  to  ancestor  graves  mine  strike  action  is  not  the 
 rules.  The  family  to  Zhang  Wenyuan,  Graves  is  essential, 
 but  this  seems  to  have  the  theme  of  not  only  for  a  family 
 dispersed  the  reunification  of  the  moment  they  are  excited. 
 Now,  many  traditional  Chinese  festivals  have  gradually  lost 
 its  original  meaning,  better  care  take  holidays  stepped  on 
 Tsing,  gatherings,  Tuan  Yuandeng  concrete  content.  At  the 
 same  time,  Valentine's  Day  festival,  Christmas  day,  Fool  "Ocean 
 Festival"  in  young  people  rapidly  warming.  Sociologists  noted 
 that,  with  the  pace  of  population  movements  and  modern  social 
 customs  and  habits  change  some  traditional  Chinese  festivals, 
 toned  down  some  rich,  while  others  have  been  given  a  new 
 content,  reflecting  a  festive  gradually  adapt  to  modern  life 
 habits  and  aesthetic  appeal  process.  Civilization  in  5,000 
 years,  the  Chinese  nation  has  formed  many  unique  traditional 
 festivals.  Shaanxi  Provincial  Academy  of  Social  Sciences  Institute 
 of  Sociology  quartz  believe  that  China's  traditional  festival 
 from  ancient  agricultural  civilization,  and  offer  a  sacrifice 
 to  ancestor  devil,  finally,  be  careful  and  far  from  recovery. 
 Zhejiang  University  Humanities  College  professor  of  sociology 
 at  Wang  Xiaozhang,  traditional  festival  has  a  significant 
 value  through  festivals  and  gatherings,  customs,  rallied  the 
 spirit  of  the  nation.  The  Tomb  Sweeping  Day  shows,  hold 
 a  memorial  service  for  the  blood  of  the  successor  to  the 
 links  between  their  ancestors  and  future  generations.  A  China 
 Social  Survey  firm  showed  that  85.7%  in  traditional  Chinese 
 festivals.  However,  as  China's  agricultural  civilization  by 
 subsistence  economy  rapidly  into  modern  industrial  civilization, 
 many  traditional  festive  flavor  change  weak.  Now,  China's 
 young  people  in  many  traditional  festivals  practices  have 
 been  very  little.  For  example,  small  roasting  eight  years, 
 and  New  Year's  scrolls  festival  stove,  windows,  cut  flowers, 
 lanterns  and  cleaning  of  the  house,  to  practise  stroll  temple 
 has  already  been  traditional  practices  such  as  People  forget, 
 only  eat  only  simple  dumplings,  such  as  the  new  year's  scrolls, 
 firecrackers  and  traditional  folk  and  modern  urban  civilization 
 because  of  the  conflict  was  gradually  abandoned.  Folklore 
 home  Lu  Hongnian,  modern  life  faster,  living  with  a  radius, 
 some  traditional  festivals  and  customs  will  inevitably  as 
 life  changes  in  the  weak.  Moreover,  many  people  from  all 
 sides  gathered  in  cities  and  brought  four  customs,  many  local 
 folk  because  lost  relatively  closed  environment  is  becoming 
 untenable.  In  many  traditional  festivals  lost  direction  at 
 the  same  time,  there  are  some  day  in  the  new  social  environment 
 have  been  given  a  new  dimension.  The  Chung  Yeung  Festival 
 in  Traditional  Chinese  also  contribute  to  regional  peace  and 
 stability,  discount  Ju,  eating  realgar  wine.  Now,  the  Chung 
 Yeung  Festival  for  Elderly  people,  and  it  expresses  the  elderly 
 and  the  content  of  the  physical,  defensive  driving  disease, 
 while  respecting  the  elderly,  reflects  the  modern  new  trend 
 of  old  love.  Environmental  changes  in  the  festival  will  convey 
 the  contents  and  meaningful  changes.  Sociologists  believe  that 
 as  long  as  active  and  healthy  life  for  the  festival,  to 
 promote  and  carry  forward.
