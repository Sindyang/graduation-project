 of  some  considered  that  it  does  not  respect  and  preserve

 engineering.  Thus,  instead  of  receiving  the  news  was  an  important 
 milestone  save  being  repaired  applause  from  the  parameters 
 of  the  Heritage,  objected  to  a  number  of  experts  and  specialists 
 to  the  methodology  for  re-consider  its  restoration  "distorted" 
 substantive  value  and  spiritual  direct  threat  to  its  position 
 on  the  map  of  the  national  heritage.  Built  on  the  subject 
 of  the  protest  refused  to  get  rid  of  the  crust  of  spiritual 
 symbols,  which  cover  non-church  blocks  polished.  Noting  that 
 it  had  been  classified  by  the  Directorate  General  of  the 
 archaeological  impact  (of  the  Ministry  of  Culture)  on  the 
 basis  of  Resolution  No.  12  (5/2  /  1997).  It  is  well  known 
 that  the  tributaries  of  the  people  of  the  village  in  the

 painted  by  artist  in  1911  Dauid  Crimea  (arrested  a  reward 
 for  technical  achievement  then  went  300  pounds),  a  and  statues 
 of  Italy.  Architectural  engineer  said,  in  his  son,  did  not 
 deny  the  need  for  the  restoration  of  the  church  in  order 
 to  preserve  them,  but  expressed  fear  of  mutilation,  which 
 had  been  in  damage  in  the  case  had  not  been  for  the  protection 
 of  historical  and  artistic.  protested  on  how  to  repair  that 
 distort  the  components  of  the  spiritual  heritage,  whatever 
 the  purpose  of  restoration  proposed  in  the  Shell  limestone 
 class  and  the  removal  of  features  ",  saying  "the  process 
 of  restoration  must  preserve  features,  because  the  workshop 
 will  eliminate  internal  crust  removed  colors  and  symbols, 
 whose  author  believers  in  the  event  that  will  change  view 
 had  been  normal."  It  pointed  out  that  "the  removal  of  crust, 
 both  technical  and  engineering  will  reveal  secrets  of  ancient 
 history  because  Al-Hajjar  used  in  construction  or  the  non-polished 
 or  embellished."  He  explained  the  importance  of  class  color 
 senses,  stressing  that  "abandoned  means  dispense  with  the 
 Church  and  spiritual  symbols  carrier,  which  generally  has 
 been  marked  by  Maronite  Catholic  churches  in  particular."

 giving  symbolic.  "she  said  of  concerned  in  particular,  the 
 Directorate  General  of  Antiquities  which  foster  archaeological 
 and  historical  milestone."  She  asked  delegate  "An-Nahar"  in 
 Marjiyoon  in  Daher  parish  priest  of  the  father  in  Mansour 
 al-Hakim,  on  the  renovation  work,  he  contended  that  it  is 
 more  necessary  for  several  reasons,  the  most  prominent  of 
 which  was  leaked  to  the  al-Hajjar  humidity  which  led  to 
 the  fragmentation  of  internal  material  lime,  which  was  covered 
 by  the  church  and  the  ceiling,  as  well  as  the  rain  water 
 that  penetrated  the  ceiling  and  caused  fissures  in  it.  " 
 He  added:  "What  is  happening  now  is  the  follow-up  to  the 
 process  of  restoration  through  disarmament  lime  remaining  after 
 a  large  portion  of  which  was  signed  by  the  war  that  has 
 distorted  because  of  humidity,  all  the  features  of  the  old 
 whitewashing  charges.  On  the  details  of  the  draft  restoration, 
 which  is  in  the  coming  days,  he  said  the  father  al-Hakim, 
 that  "includes  the  Dome  of  the  church  so  that  the  church 
 any  high  rise  equivalent  to  11  m,  and,  disarmament  and  lime 
 once  and  for  all,  the  restoration  of  the  internal  walls, 
 doors  and  the  rehabilitation  of  the  painting  room  bell.  He 
 pointed  out  that  all  officials  at  the  Directorate  of  Rainies 
 effects  of  the  Parish  Pastoral  agents  cut-off,  they  agreed 
 to  the  renovation  work  on  the  basis  of  consulting  engineers 
 appoint  specialists  at  the  directorate  of  the  Committee  on 
 the  effects  of  the  effects  of  the  Commission  on  the  moratorium. 
 The  whole  church,  according  to  the  rehabilitation  of  these 
 assets  approved  in  each  of  the  archaeological  community  Maronite 
 church."  On  the  other  hand,  Wise  father  recognized  the  importance 
 of  the  historic  Church  archaeological  classified,  especially 
 after  the  year.  "We  have  decided  to  re-repair  and  rehabilitation 
 of  the  roof  and  walls.  We  have  initiated  three  years  ago, 
 building  above  the  surface  crown  room"  ",  as  we  have  supported 
 the  cornerstone  of  the  central  dome  surface  al-Turabi,  which 
 has  been  built  without  the  pillars  of  iron  or.  "He  pointed 
 out  that  the  cost  of  the  work  carried  out  first  amounted 
 to  80  thousand  American  dollars  contributed  to  the  Directorate 
 General  of  Antiquities  about  20  thousand  of  them,  as  a  contribution 
 of  the  people  of  the  town  with  the  rest  of  the  amount. 
 Al-Hakim,  the  father  acknowledges  that  in  carrying  out  repair 
 work  has  been  obtained  the  approval  of  the  first  time  the 
 Director-General  of  Antiquities  Camille  Al  Asmar,  however, 
 the  workshop  were  interrupted  because  of  the  security  and 
 economic  conditions  experienced  in  the  town  after  Israel's 
 withdrawal.  Today  it  is  no  longer  possible  for  a  postponement, 
 we  have  therefore  decided  to  resume  restoration  in  spite 
 of  all  circumstances."  He  also  pointed  out  that  the  cost 
 of  the  proposed  project  was  estimated  at  approximately  200 
 thousand  dollars,  he  pointed  out  that  its  sources  of  funding 
 will  come  only  from  the  people  of  the  town,  "built  thanks 
 to  the  efforts  of  the  sons  of  the  parish  contributions  should 
 be  tributaries  Also,  we  do  not  expect  any  external  assistance. 
 It  is  expected  to  take  repair  workshop  about  a  year  or 
 more,  therefore,  the  parish  in  connection  with  the  processing 
 of  alternative  hall  east  of  the  church,  where  they  will 
 be  conveyed  to  them  in  the  Saint  Jawarjius  will  continue 
 prayers  in  the  form  of  normal  ".  The  reasons  for  the  challenge 
 Article  2  of  resolution  year  inclusion  of  the  church  in 
 the  list  of  historic  buildings  inventory  (No.  12  in  1997): 
 "should  not  be  any  action  that  would  change  the  status  quo 
 archaeological  construction  based  on  the  aforementioned  property 
 without  the  consent  of  the  Directorate  General  of  Antiquities 
 semen  work  carried  out  prior  to  the  use  of  materials  and 
 semen."  Whether  the  authorization  given  by  the  Directorate-General. 
 Still  in  force  ?  Does  this  mean  that  it  is  obliged  to 
 follow  this  problem  today,  in  particular,  the  church  be  classified 
 as  "historical  !"  Although  the  intervention  by  parish  priest 
 of  the  Mar  Girgis-in  in  the  restoration  of  the  church,  comes 
 as  a  result  of  the  desire,  it  should  be  noted  that  some 
 of  the  people  of  the  town  on  the  other,  cultural  and  spiritual 
 heritage,  which  is  also  time  to  contest  the  renovation  project 
 in  its  current  form.  is  part  of  the  memory  of  its  sons, 
 and  the  change  in  its  features  is  Mesa  sanctity  engineering. 
 In  conclusion,  it  must  be  put  forward  a  number  of  questions: 
 whether  previous  resolutions  of  the  Directorate  General  of 
 Antiquities  will  remain  in  force  ?  will  allow  the  Ministry 
 of  Culture,  non-restoration  observer  to  the  site  of  "historical" 
 sort  itself  ?  Where  is  the  foundation  of  the  national  heritage 
 of  what  happened  ?  Mi  Elian  Rizq

 the  wake  of  the  With  the  American  aggression,  continuing 
 British  on  Iraq,  for  all  Iraq,  it  has  been  delayed  once 
 again,  by  the  growing  tendency  American  military  threat  (wars 
 within  six  months  and  the  return  of  the  large  majority  of 
 American  political  and  military  to  reject  the  "statement" 
 American  defeat  in  Vietnam.)  It  has  been  delayed  in  the 
 Arab  world,  all  other  issues  in  favour  of  the  national  cause. 
 No  other  choice.  It  is  in  the  Arab  world.  The  question 
 of  the  national  cause,  not  for  profit  and  loss  accounts 
 field,  but  the  question  of  the  "legitimacy  ",  which  does 
 not  understand  yet  planners  Americans  with  some  of  whom  appeared 
 at  times  seemed  to  understand.  Practical,  albeit  slowly,  did 
 not  understand  that  it  is  impossible  to  stabilize  a  positive 
 image  of  the  United  States  in  the  region  without  resolving 
 the  Arab-Israeli  conflict  a  just  and  lasting  solution  to 
 the  Palestinian  people.  How  would  the  region  with  military 
 invasion,  but  so-called  Anti-Americans,  even  if  a  new  dynamic 
 stand  in  front  of  a  political  system,  such  as  the  Iraqi 
 regime,  that  is  more  a  lack  system  in  their  own  systems 
 among  all  the  Arab  world.  Probably.  fall  of  the  Iraqi  regime, 
 but  this  does  not  mean  that  America's  war  profit  deep  established 
 standards  for  profit.  Those  who  are  in  the  Arab  world,  some 
 Iraqi  opposition  and  outside  the  draft  of  the  war  on  Iraq 
 refused  to  even  at  the  height  of  extraordinary  rejection 
 of  an  authoritarian  regime  in  Baghdad-knew  that  the  very 
 beginning  of  the  war,  and  will  only  be  for  all  Iraqis  human 
 beings  and  built  a  destructive  war,  which  will  eliminate 
 any  possibility  of  a  long  period  of  time  to  change  with 
 the  legitimacy  of  the  interests  of  the  region  and  their 
 peoples  in  progress  and  modernization.  This  occupation,  to 
 put  an  end  to  the  American-British  Iraq  is  now  the  absolute 
 priority,  because  as  long  as  this  occupation  is  primarily 
 the  responsibility  will  be  replenished  the  equation  that  American 
 policy  in  the  region,  which  would  make  it  all  dictator  nationally, 
 and  all  democratic  clients,  Americans  themselves  how  the  issue 
 of  "legitimacy"  of  the  most  crucial  Iraqi  elites,  social 
 and  depth.  discover  that  followed  an  important  field  developments 
 However  proceeded.  Therefore,  with  the  beginning  of  the  aggression, 
 the  point  where  the  "political  action"  military  action,  the 
 core  issue  in  Iraq  and  the  Arab  world  has  become,  as  has 
 happened  repeatedly  in  the  former  standing  in  the  introduction 
 of  Palestine  -  The  question  of  the  "legitimacy"  in  whatever 
 field  profit  and  loss  accounts  !  "  These  specific  language 
 in  the  Arab  region.  Since  the  post-World  War  I  until  today. 
 Apart  from  other  language  sent  world  movement  against  the 
 war  on  Iraq.  In  New  York,  Paris,  London,  Madrid  or  Tokyo. 
 Nature  here  differences  exist  between  the  two  movements:  the 
 movement  against  the  war  on  global  anti-war  movement  at  the 
 Arab  level.  Before  the  war  was  the  difference  between  the 
 two  movements  and  Arab  world  based  on  the  first  in  its 
 objection  to  the  war  did  not  see  Iraq  ",  but  in  the  view 
 of  America  and  the  dangers  of  growing  military  tendency. 
 It  was  a  debate  within  the  system  West-general,  as  governments 
 and  communities.  In  the  second  on  Iraq  over  the  same  (as 
 part  of  the  Iraqi  regime  vision  for  reconciliation).  But, 
 after  the  war,  the  difference  between  the  two  movements  to 
 move  forward  when  different  Second,  the  Arab  Movement,  the 
 question  of  the  "legitimacy"  and  rejected  what  it  considers 
 force  fraction.  Each  connected  awareness  tragic  recent  history 
 since  the  fall  of  the  Ottoman  empire,  but  also  accepted. 
 American  experience  in  the  1950s.  In  that  period  when  pursuing 
 the  implementation  of  the  American  administration  has  started 
 its  strategic  priority  at  the  global  level  to  contain  the 
 Soviet  Union,  have  been  put  forward  a  programme  of  two  key 
 points  in  the  Middle  East  and  South  Asia  in  particular. 
 The  first  point  is  to  withdraw  "national  cause"  by  communist 
 parties  in  the  countries  of  the  two  regions  and  to  make 
 it,  according  to  American  literature  that  stage  of  a  number 
 of  Planners,  the  issue  will  be  represented  by  the  communists. 
 Communists  and  thereby  make  to  "agents  of  foreign  force" 
 is  of  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  eyes  of  their  peoples.  The 
 second  point  is  to  draw  upon  the  "army"  in  the  Arab  world 
 and  south-east  Asia  in  particular  to  put  an  end  to  the 
 influence  of  imperial  ""  Britain,  France,  as  the  army  is 
 an  institution  capable  of  coherent  social,  economic  and  political 
 modernization.  The  1950s  suggest  practical  policies  that  Washington 
 has  already  embarked  on  the  application  of  this  programme. 
 The  first  is  more  Egyptian  support  coup  against  the  king, 
 which  has  turned  to  the  revolution  led  by  Gamal  Abdel  Nasser. 
 He  then  followed  the  position  of  support  for  the  year  1956 
 against  Britain,  France  and  Israel.  The  climax  of  the  application 
 of  the  programme  status  when  they  appear  difficult  Syrian 
 Communist  Party  unity  against  Syrian-Egyptian,  then  the  height 
 of  the  national  legitimate.  Flow  repression  in  Damascus,  Cairo 
 without  trouble.  In  south-east  Asia,  the  Americans  are  seeking 
 to  support  "of  a  national  force"  against  the  Vietnamese  Communist 
 Party,  that  was  the  beginning  of  the  South  Vietnam  against 
 northern  Vietnam.  .  did  not  come  the  1960s  was  the  only 
 things  have  been  taken  against  upside  down  to  an  end  to 
 the  dramatic.  "Forgot"  this  equation  because  of  its  relations 
 with  Israel,  Arab  enemy,  national  enemy  upward  trend  in  the 
 face  then  led  by  Abdul  Nasser.  Owing  to  Israeli  pressure 
 American  bias,  conspired  against  unity  Washington  Syrian-Egyptian, 
 and  turned  in  the  1960s  to  an  enemy  Abd  al-Nasser,  so  that 
 national  in  the  Arab  world  are  exactly  the  enemies  of  America, 
 including,  but  in  the  Communists  !  have  also  started  to 
 American  military  involvement  in  Vietnam,  which  concluded  there 
 is  a  historic  defeat  by  Vietnamese  nationals  who  are  this 
 time  the  Communists  themselves,  but  no  one  else.  The  disaster 
 intensified  in  the  south-east  Asia,  because  in  the  Middle

 The  historic  compliant  by  the  end  of  the  war  marked  the 
 end  of  the  French  imperial  era,  the  end  of  the  first  and 
 second  world  wars,  German  and  British  Imperial  periods  neo-Nazi 
 sequence.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  end  of  the  Cold  War 
 was  an  important  turning  point  in  the  transformation  of  the 
 world  of  bipolar  strife  or  camps  to  stage  Polar  unilateral 
 or  only  great  power.  The  United  States  enjoyed  overwhelming 
 superiority  at  the  earliest  its  competitors  in  various  areas. 
 According  to  2000:  the  elements  of  the  force  are:  the  military 
 capacity,  the  finance  and  economy,  9-technical  and  Informatics 
 (technological  know-how).  For  America  have  advanced  conventional 
 and  nuclear  military  force  in  the  world  military  superiority 
 its  budget  for  the  year  2003  (excluding  the  cost  of  Iraq's 
 invasion)  total  budgets  in  military  spending,  followed  by 
 20  states,  which  added  the  enormous  potential  for  rapid  deployment 
 in  various  regions  of  the  world  and  support  a  network  of 
 sophisticated  satellite  spy  planes  and  early  warning  and  means 
 of  electronic  communication  link  complex.  The  financially-American 
 national  economic  output  equivalent  to  twice  the  Japan  national 
 output  of  the  mandate  of  the  California  alone  than  French 
 product.  According  to  Economist  magazine  larger  than  the  American 
 economy  total  economy  of  Japan,  Germany,  Britain,  together. 
 The  American  precedence  in  the  fields  of  science  and  technology 
 and  research  are  more  clearly  supported  by  huge  financial 
 balance  funded  by  the  public  and  private  sectors.  It  is 
 estimated  that  the  United  States  allocated  annually  for  scientific 
 research  and  technical  development  total  spending  by  the  seven 
 major  industrialized  countries  that  followed  in  wealth.  The 
 United  States  to  surpass  earlier  empires  and  the  major  powers 
 inter  alia:  margin  American  superiority  in  the  nearest  competitors 
 set  a  precedent  was  not  known  parallel  history.  America  country 
 geographically  so  long  isolation  from  the  events  and  variables 
 which  is  located  in  the  world,  their  growing  strength  does 
 not  frighten  its  immediate  neighbours  regional  imbalance  does 
 not  occur  in  the  balance  of  power,  as  is  the  case  with 
 Russia  or  Germany  or  Japan  or  China.  a  country  with  a  multiplicity 
 of  vast  natural  wealth  climatic  tremendous  productive  capacities 
 continuous  increase  in  population  (about  38  million  between 
 1990-2000)  no  more  than  half  the  population  of  France  and 
 Britain.  All  the  above-mentioned  many  times  by  others  to 
 make  some  politicians  as  American.  a  political  analyst  Charles 
 1991  called  for  two  years  after  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet 
 Union  and  analyses  of  the  socialist  camp  to  a  new  world 
 order  consisting  of  unilateral  American  polar.  Well-known  British 
 historian  Paul  Kennedy  was  speaking  on  the  strength  of  the 
 American  superiority  in  the  number  one  at  a  cost  is  high, 
 and  to  be  a  great  power  in  the  world  only  low-cost  is 
 something  else.  "For  America  retain  overwhelming  military  superiority 
 expenditure  does  not  exceed  3.5%  of  the  national  output. 
 However,  more  than  40  percent  of  Americans  believe  that  America 
 is  today  a  major  force  among  a  number  of  major  powers  which 
 continue  to  increase  their  number.  According  to  a  political 
 analyst  Samuel  Huntington  in  his  article  "great  force"  to 
 the  beginning  of  a  new  era,  called  the  unilateral-multi-polar 
 "Huntington  believed  that  the  single-polar  mean  that  there 
 is  a  great  power  in  the  absence  of  any  single  force  with 
 the  presence  of  a  number  of  other  relevant  micro-power  and 
 great  to  be  the  dominant  force  in  solving  international  problems 
 can  only  be  able  to  function  without  any  system  or  a  group 
 of  states  to  prevent  or  even  to  influence.  Now,  the  question, 
 whether  the  United  States  is  able  or  qualified  to  assume 
 this  role  ?  Soon,  the  answer  is  negative.  For  America  had 
 not  been  resolved,  or  may  not  wish  to  a  solution,  many 
 of  the  basic  problems  and  difficulties  which  threaten  the 
 future  of  international  humanitarian  and  security,  on  the 
 contrary  it  would,  for  example,  persisted  in  support  of  the 
 Zionist  entity  occupying  Palestine  usurped  Arab  areas,  despite 
 atrocities  and  massacres  perpetrated  on  a  daily  basis  against 
 civilian  women  and  children,  and  ensured  a  qualitative  superiority 
 in  weapons  and  financial  support  diplomatic  cover  economic 
 billions  of  dollars  in  the  Security  Council,  despite  a  blow 
 to  disregard  the  dozens  of  international  resolutions  and  the 
 status  of  a  neutral  negotiator  sponsor  of  the  peace  negotiations, 
 has  gained  nothing  against  Arabs  and  Muslims  and  Christians. 
 More  of  the  many  intellectuals  and  unique  American  politicians 
 bridges  Robin  Zakaria  came  at  the  root  causes  of  hostility 
 towards  America  in  our  relationship  with  nature  of  the  ruling 
 political  systems  and  do  not  recognize  the  impact  of  policy 
 in  support  of  Israel.  They  emphasize  that  America  support 
 of  some  Arab  rulers  Despotics  corrupt  reflected  hate  them 
 in  the  Arab  street.  In  addition  to  the  Palestinian  problem 
 in  the  United  States  has  failed  to  solve  many  of  the  hot 
 issues  as  nuclear  proliferation  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction 
 in  particular,  the  crisis  in  Kashmir  between  nuclear  neighbours 
 India  and  Pakistan.  In  addition  to  a  series  of  failures 
 American  neglect  of  the  problem  of  poverty,  malnutrition, 
 particularly  in  the  African  continent  condoning  for  a  long 
 time  to  cope  with  the  AIDS  pandemic,  which  exceeded  the 
 number  of  people  infected  with  40  million,  more  than  90% 
 of  them  in  states  that  do  not  have  financial  capacity  to 
 respond  to  the  epidemic  and  reduce  its  spread.  It  has  not 
 made  any  move  to  stop  ethnic  massacres  in  Rwanda,  religious 
 and  in  Nigeria  has  continued  to  support  a  number  of  dictatorial 
 regimes  in  the  world  despite  the  lifting  of  the  slogans 
 of  human  rights,  democracy  and  political  reform.  It  seems 
 that  the  strong  American  force  engaged  in  increasing  their 
 capacity  with  the  international  community  made  a  lot  of  bluntness, 
 sometimes  overlooked.  Most  global  environment  of  the  Rio  Conference 
 in  order  to  preserve  the  VIII  to  Kyoto  industrial  interests, 
 have  fought  battles  against  closer  economic  allies,  steel 
 and  steel  bananas,  the  protection  of  the  tax  imposed  on 
 the  production,  despite  its  call  for  more  liberal  economy 
 that  almost  led  to  the  failure  of  the  World  Trade  Organization 
 (WTO)  collapse.  Affected  by  the  American  political  thinking 
 in  the  1990s  Francis  Fukuyama  at  the  end  of  history,  although 
 the  subsequent  events  have  proved  to  be  incorrect.  It  has 
 signed  Fukuyama  ideological  conflicts  as  a  result  of  the 
 victory  of  the  end  of  the  political  and  economic  liberalism, 
 but  failed  to  appreciate  the  importance  of  national  loyalty 
 and  commitment  to  the  national  religious  affiliation  when 
 many  people  appear  on  a  kind  of  split  between  reality  and 
 theoretical  in  international  political  relations  of  the  United 
 States.  According  to  well-known  German  is  that  there  must 
 be  to  declare  war  against  the  well-known,  so  that  it  is 
 estimated  to  surrender  or  undertake  not  to  renew  the  ball. 
 But  George  Bush  the  father  and  son  after  Clinton  decided 
 to  wage  war  against  their  opponents  could  not  be  won  by 
 crime  and  drugs,  finally,  not  least,  terrorism.  Although  it 
 is  impossible  for  the  victory  over  such  wanted  to  add  the 
 emblem  of  the  right  of  human  rights,  which  is  null  and 
 void  by  the  donors  themselves  standing  in  the  privacy  of 
 states  to  intervene  in  matters  of  historical  facts,  causes 
 markers,  excluded  Israeli  terrorism  allies  daily  human  rights. 
 They  declared  war  against  the  Serbs  in  the  Milosevic  regime 
 when  Yugoslavia  not  to  react  with  the  Security  Council  in 
 the  legislation  of  the  war  had  sought  protection  under  the 
 umbrella  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization.  The  relations 
 between  the  two  banks  of  the  Atlantic,  especially  between 
 the  United  States  and  Europe  is  going  through  a  critical 
 period  caused  by  loss  of  confidence,  serious  competing  economically 
 unified  Europe,  if  not  military  technology  and  the  United 
 States  there  is  a  form  of  mistrust  between  the  two  sides 
 is  clear  in  the  press  and  media  reason  to  believe  Times 
 editor  Richard  Lambert  demise  of  the  danger  of  the  socialist 
 camp  and  cold-war  Berlin  Wall,  which  has  affected  Atlantic 
 relations  for  many  decades.  Assistant  Minister  for  Foreign 
 Affairs  and  the  current  chairman  of  the  institution  of  previous 
 studies  Strobe  Talbot  believes  that  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty 
 Organization  (NATO)  is  suffering  from  an  American  marginalization 
 of  the  crisis  is  clear.  The  United  States  has  maintained 
 that  the  exclusion  of  any  of  the  role  of  military  and  strategic 
 alliance  in  the  war  in  Afghanistan,  which  today  suffer  from 
 the  risk  of  division  due  to  the  divergence  of  views  on 
 the  military  invasion  of  Iraq.  Now  that  the  aggression  began 
 American-British  on  Iraq,  is  becoming  more  complex.  It  is 
 not  a  threat  to  the  military  conquest  of  the  security  of 
 the  region,  but  before  international  relations  to  further 
 tension  and  sensitivity  and  might  create  a  new  international 
 order  after  the  failure  of  international  institutions  such 
 as  the  Security  Council  explained  current  limitations  in  dealing 
 with  the  American  the  Iraqi  crisis.  The  Security  Council 
 and  the  United  Nations  is  the  fate  of  the  fate  of  the 
 League  of  Nations  ?  faced  with  NATO  despite  the  growing 
 number  of  state  of  the  problem  of  finding  a  role  in  the 
 world  insist  that  only  a  great  power  monopoly  roles  each 
 and  every  measure  in  proportion  to  their  interests  ?  So 
 that  the  unity  of  Europe  are  at  risk  as  a  result  of  the 
 main  pivots  polarization  between  French-German  Russia  supported 
 by  the  (European  Troika)  aims  at  Anglo-Spanish  supported  by 
 Italy  and  eastern  European  states,  France,  Germany,  which 
 they  are  singled  out  for  control  of  the  policy  of  the  European 
 system.  Globalization  came  three.  Economic,  which  has  increased 
 the  rich  richer  and  the  young  and  adults  the  magnitude  of 
 the  poor  and  needy:  Cultural  who  tried  to  abolish  the  national 
 identity  and  heritage  of  cultures  and  the  imposition  of  a 
 pattern  of  behaviour  is  not  commensurate  with  social  traditions 
 and  beliefs,  and  political  transformation  of  state  and  government, 
 which  targeted  the  abolition  of  the  border  into  something 
 like  a  local  administrations.  The  understanding  of  the  world 
 of  globalization  as  reserve  merits  focused  on  the  humanitarian 
 aspects  in  the  interests  of  the  effectiveness  offenses  productivity 
 ?  left  was  Karl  Marx,  traditional  and  new  Frederic  ingles. 
 The  American  invasion  of  Iraq  aimed  at  achieving  many  things 
 and  put  to  test  the  fate  of  many  enterprises,  which  seized 
 the  pace  of  relations  in  the  post  of  the  Second  World  War. 
 The  goal  of  the  war  is  declared  American  removal  and  disposal 
 of  Saddam  Hussein's  dictatorial  regime  and  the  restoration 
 of  democracy  in  Iraq.  It  also  did  not  hide  their  intention 
 to  change  the  Americans  geo-political  in  the  region  affect 
 many  states  and  regulations  on  the  grounds  that  they  do 
 not  meet  the  wishes  of  the  peoples  of  autocratic  following 
 a  threat  to  American  interests  are  vital.  But  most  observers 
 believe  firmly  that  America's  oil  wealth  because  it  wanted 
 to  invade  Iraq's  desire  to  control  sources  of  these  vital 
 commodity,  and  it  was  also  designed  and  control  of  strategic 
 presence  in  the  region,  while  Simpson  stresses  large  British 
 radio  and  television  correspondents  in  the  form  of  psychological 
 factor  of  the  Americans,  saying  that  after  it  lost  a  large 
 part  of  the  self-confidence  quake  America's  image  in  the 
 world  after  September  11  is  the  need  for  substantial  military 
 battle  Zahir  lesson  will  not  forget  the  world  is  one  of 
 the  return  of  the  globe.  This  was  unchanged  with  Japan  after 
 Pearl  Harbour  and  did  not  stop  the  war  and  accept  the  surrender 
 of  Japan  only  after  the  strike  nuclear  bombs.  It  is  true 
 there  is  evidence  that  everything  that  has  been  supported 
 by  many,  but  we  must  not  forget  that  the  United  States 
 to  assume  responsibility  for  the  Arabs  to  different  religious 
 sects,  following  the  events  of  September  11,  and  the  desire 
 to  try  to  break  the  resistance  at  capacity.  It  is  a  new 
 colonialism  entitled  different.  The  most  pressing  question: 
 does  the  Americans  and  their  allies  British  succeed  ?  As 
 a  result  of  military  confrontation  between  Iraqi  invading 
 armies  are  important,  and  any  loss  incurred  by  the  occupiers 
 have  a  positive  impact,  and  any  determination  shown  by  the 
 Iraqis  might  lead  to  audit  Plans  changed  in  view  of  the 
 American  Society  (naive)  of  the  war.  But  the  same  importance 
 to  this  challenge  American  long-term  could  be  dealt  with 
 the  Arabs.  Do  we  are  capable  of  confrontation  or  non-qualified 
 and  try  to  many,  including  reports  of  population  development 
 of  the  United  Nations  photography  ?  If  they  drop  all  priorities 
 slogans  including  talk  of  democracy  and  development  and  modernization 
 has  on  two  priorities:  Palestinian  weapons  through  the  defeat 
 of  Israel,  using  all  means,  first  and  foremost  Jihad  testimony, 
 Iraqi  across  the  face  of  the  American  scheme  and  preventing 
 it  from  achieving  its  objectives  and  strategy  immediate  later. 
 Perhaps  the  fate  Arabs  to  re-Americans  and  the  world  balance, 
 it  is  not  the  United  States  maintains  excessive  force  and 
 the  French  call,  over-the  term  used  in  many  fields  of  medicine 
 and  the  economy  and  meet  other  satisfactory  health  to  reflect 
 the  increase.  In  this  area  was  Fareed  Zakaria,  editor  of 
 international  edition  of  "Newsweek  ",  the  world  feared  America 
 because  it  did  not  understand  because  they  had  lost  a  minimum 
 of  decency  diplomatic  political  credibility.  The  United  States 
 has  tried  to  change  many  parameters  that  mankind  has  struggled 
 over  time  in  order  to  achieve  a  just  state  regulatory  institutions 
 and  human  rights  to  them.  They  are  now  attempting  to  occupy 
 part  of  our  land  as  if  we  live  in  a  vacuum.  We  have  forgotten 
 or  ignored  the  roots  of  our  civilization  and  completeness 
 of  the  depth  of  our  faith  and  commitment,  we  must  be  reminded 
 of  the  various  methods  that  we  are  Capables.  We  have  demonstrated 
 our  recently  in  various  stages  buy  Suez,  the  armed  struggle 
 to  build  a  road  of  liberalization,  and  the  big  victory  for 
 the  resistance  in  Lebanon  and  the  continuation  of  the  series 
 of  Heroisms  intifada  in  Palestine  and  steadfastness  in  Iraq. 
 History  is  not  much,  but  the  design  of  peoples.  There  is 
 no  change  to  God  to  change  the  themselves,  if  not  salt

 for  agricultural  production,  then  it  would  be  best  to  transform 
 this  support  to  direct  support  to  farmers  in  line  with  what 
 is  happening  in  the  majority  of  the  states  of  the  world 
 (Olive  oil  production  support,  for  example,  European  states 
 to  pay  the  farms  1.2  euros  for  each  liters  of  oil  output. 
 They  also  bear  the  cost  of  pest  control  the  olives)  or 
 to  establish  institutions  buying  output  from  farmers  to  return 
 some  loss  due  to  be  issued  by  the  support  funds  to  cover 
 the  difference  between  the  purchase  price  and  income  from 
 export  process  ".  He  also  called  on  the  board  of  directors 
 of  the  institution  "ideal"  B  "to  take  a  decision  file  attention, 
 particularly  the  clause  agricultural  marketing,  and  the  creation 
 of  new  markets  for  agricultural  products."  He  concluded:  "If

 could  be  formulated  in  such  a  partnership  between  the"  ideal 
 "domestic  agricultural  sector,  support"  ideal  "moral  this  partnership,

 an  average  rate  of  lira,  which  for  more  than  three  and 
 a  half  years.  However,  owing  to  the  tyranny  of  supply-demand, 
 it  was  the  dollar  circulation  during  work  hours  without  intervention 
 by  the  Bank  of  Lebanon,  the  ceiling  margin  between  1512.00

 on  the  green  paper  in  parallel  with  the  growing  expectations 
 on  the  last  time  that  Iraq  war  and  the  high  cost  involved 
 in  American  treasury  incurred  as  a  result.  It  has  been  strengthened 
 by  concerns  about  the  future  of  the  employment  of  the  assets 
 of  the  American  officer  after  the  suicide  operation  undertaken 
 by  Iraqi  forces  against  a  group  of  "Marines"  American  near

 that  the  decline  in  the  index  below  the  threshold  of  50.00

 was  issued  yesterday  by  disadvantages  of  economic  fundamentals 
 on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  oceans  him  weak 
 in  the  dollar.  Indeed,  dealers  ignored  the  Declaration  on 
 the  European  Commission  that  the  monthly  index  to  measure 
 investment  climate  in  the  euro  area  fell  from  98.40  points 
 in  February  to  97.80  points  in  March,  which  is  the  lowest

 Myriad  mysteries  secrets  overflow  promise  by  the  presence 
 in  all,  how  to  address  the  concern  and  fear  the  establishment 
 of  the  rules  of  ensure  sustainability  of  convergence  outside 
 the  conflict  and  the  logic  of  the  rivalry  ?  The  other  to 
 maintain  self-reliance  in  able  to  escape  from  the  impact 
 of  these  questions  ?  We  are  not  exaggerating  never  go  in 
 our  analysis  to  emphasize  that  the  issue  of  the  major  human 
 shorten  with  ramifications  and  complexities  in  one  issue: 
 peace.  Peace  with  self-reliance  and  peace  with  others  as 
 a  prerequisite  for  the  kind  of  happiness  relative,  scarcity 
 of  basic  human.  Thus,  we  trust  in  human  concerns  and  the 
 search  for  peace  in  war  and  the  happiness  of  the  pain  and. 
 This  is  human  beings  on  the  realities  of  the  inspector  never 
 fugitive,  shows  the  nature  on  growth  and  development  within 
 equivalent  contradictions  and  inconsistencies.  Because  many 
 intellectuals  philosophers  phenomenon  of  violence  and  conflict 
 in  human  life  to  the  substance  of  the  nature  and  controlled 
 by  laws  limited.  Because  of  inadequate  presence  imbalance, 
 which  is  based  on  the  perception,  become  Time  To  date,  no 
 common  ground  to  a  series  of  events,  most  often,  tragic 
 character.  From  here  to  say,  which  has  become  memorables 
 "not  happy  that  the  peoples  of  the  date  for  it."  It  said 
 that  the  human  usually  joyful  events  in  the  embrace  of  in, 
 was  from  the  shackles  of  time  and  place  in  areas  once  and 
 for  all  to  deter  history  to  infiltrate  and  reside  there. 
 Here  the  right  to  ask:  Is  there  any  of  the  peoples  of 
 historic  events  did  not  register  themselves  ?  Certainly  not. 
 Therefore,  there  are  no  people  happy.  This  fact  led  Jean-Paul 
 in  his  book  "The  declaration  of  war  on  the  war"  in  the 
 year  1809  to  say:  "So  far,  it's  war  spanning  the  chapters 
 of  history  books.  Peace  does  not  add  up  here  and  there 
 are  only  some  margins."  comes  in  the  framework  of  the  war 
 scientists  Statistics  figures  to  prove  its  vast  area  occupied 
 by  bloody  conflicts  between  all  peoples.  Over  three  thousand 
 years,  it  was  possible  to  count  some  hundred  Seventy-one 
 year  of  peace  has  been  in  preparation  for  launching  wars 
 or  to  deter  them.  Thus,  it  appears  violence  not  only  as 
 an  engine  components  exist,  but  also  in  particular,  it  is 
 difficult  for  them  in  accordance  with  events  in  the  midst 
 of  a  study  that.  To  monitor  this  reality  for  payment  of 
 philosopher,  ,  in  the  sixth  century  G.  M.  to  consider  any 
 of  the  principle  of  war  conflicts,  either  giving  birth  to 
 rigid  all  living  organisms,  according  to  the  laws  of  the 
 movement  which  is  the  only,  according  to,  the  basis  of  continuity 
 of  presence.  From  here  prayers,  which  has  been  criticized 
 for  every  violent  people  gods  for  peace  is  restored.  was 
 wrong,  saying:  "Leete  dispute  disappear  between  gods  human 
 beings."  It  was  not  aware  that  it  was  pray  for  the  destruction 
 of  the  universe,  if  links,  all  organisms.  This  perception 
 of  life  and  existence  maintained  fire  communication  even  received 
 a  new  impetus  to  the  philosophy  of  acted  as  controversial 
 conflict  historical  show  if  direct  echo  hunch  philosopher 
 shine  in  specifically  for  that  following  the  principle  of 
 the  conflict:  "Up  against,  coalition  is  one  which  combines 
 opposites."  However,  this  positive  outlook  to  the  principle 
 of  the  conflict  did  not  find  unanimity  among  intellectuals, 
 especially  in  the  fields  of  sociology  and  political  science. 
 It  seems  that  the  intifada  against  controversial  intellectual 
 made  deep  in  the  historical  trend  to  violent  and  toppling 
 the  fatness  permanent  renewal  of  the  human  body,  draws  a 
 driving  force  of  a  civilization  of  love  Christian  laid  down 
 by  the  rules  of  the  self-sacrifice  and  forgiveness,  acceptance 
 of  others  in  what  is  different,  single-cell  is  alive  in 
 the  human  body,  based  on  unity  in  diversity.  It  is  without 
 significantly  to  the  comprehensive  review  of  the  ideas  in 
 favour  of  the  principle  of  violence  and  the  opposition  to 
 him,  just  a  rapid  philosophical  the  essence  of  the  conflict 
 and  peace.  With  thinking  in  the  sixteenth  century,  there 
 was  strong  emphasis  on  the  need  for  sustainable  renewal, 
 but  outside  a  cycle  of  violence  and  within  institutions  and 
 organizations,  within  the  movement  of  calm  and  meaningful 
 development.  In  the  subject  of  freedom,  under  the  title  of 
 the  poem  des  Greek  poet  "Those  who  did  not  good  War"  (1515), 
 says:  "If  there  is  among  the  matters  of  human  beings,  we 
 should  accept  it  reluctantly,  or  rather  that  by  all  means, 
 it  is  certainly  the  war.  It  goes  on  in  an  article  thinker 
 Rotterdam  bear  titles  other  profound  sadness  and  more  gloomy" 
 Mourning  Peace  "(1517):"  The  scourge  of  war  States  tomb  justice. 
 In  disarmament,  silent  religions.  If  the  blasphemous  and  forget 
 religion  lay  behind  the  tragedy,  these  reach  their  maximum 
 limits  in  the  violence  of  war.  In  comparison  between  the 
 scourge  of  war  peace,  shows  following  matters:  "We  have  to 
 eliminate  the  causes  of  war  in  its  infancy.  In  order  to 
 do  so,  we  should  turn  a  blind  eye  to  the  certain  rights. 
 There  are  cases  we  have  a  duty  to  purchase  impose  peace. 
 When  we  take  the  process  of  the  statistics  of  the  cost 
 of  war  and  a  number  of  citizens  who  escape  from  death, 
 his  peace  seems  to  be  purchased  at  a  price  Zahid,  whatever 
 the  price.  When  we  think,  however,  in  which  pains  and  property, 
 which,  not  him  very  much  that  we  have  to  pay  the  price 
 of  peace  ".  To  this  thinking,  non-violent  guided  directly 
 from  the  Bible,  did  not  succeed  in  amending  the  positions 
 of  a  man  of  the  Netherlands  Hugo  Grotius  Diplomatic  Law 
 (1583-1645),  which  placed  all  have  been  categorically  rejected 
 the  principle  of  the  war  in  the  column.  In  his  book  "The 
 right  of  war  and  peace"  (1625),  the  author  seeks  She  not 
 only  to  the  war  on  behalf  of  the  human  and  moral  principles, 
 but  the  legal  controls  over  control  of  them  from  breaking 
 out  if  absolutely  necessary  and  after  the  fall  of  bargainings 
 all  the  negotiations.  The  memorandum  Abbe  Pierre  de  san  firm 
 to  make  peace  in  Europe  (1712)  after  his  return  from  the 
 peace  conference  in  Utrecht  drink  not  far  from  that  of  the 
 principles  of  the  start  thinking  of  Grotius.  With  his  father, 
 Pierre  de  San,  emerged  from  the  question  of  peace  of  the 
 religious  service  requirements  moral  considerations,  then  stopped, 
 effective  intervention  in  the  framework  of  the  political  treatment: 
 collective  security  has  become  subject  to  the  rule  of  law. 
 On  the  basis  of  this  reality,  it  was  suggested  that  the 
 formation  of  the  intervention  force  deter  members,  in  what 
 he  called  "European  body,  who  had  not  respected  peaceful 
 alliance  between  the  nations  of  Europe.  The  project  for  a 
 lasting  peace,  we  also  note,  was  designed  only  European  states. 
 In  order  to  emerge  from  this  narrow,  we  will  have  to  wait 
 for  the  emergence  of  Rousseau  even  read  philosophical  project 
 on  the  scene  of  a  comprehensive  peace.  In  the  context  of 
 the  opinion  of  the  scheme  of  lasting  peace  Father  de  Saint-Pierre 
 Rousseau  year  )  recognized  the  importance  of  the  book  describes 
 the  author's  proposals  very  deep  and  necessary,  but  could 
 not  remain  simply  to  criticize  the  author  of  in  non-stop 
 enough  when  operational  means  towards  genuine  implementation 
 of  the  programme  of  this  type  of  establishing  a  lasting 
 peace.  What  is  most  critical  tone  when  dealing  with  confidence 
 and  unjustified  large  Abbe  Pierre  de  san  valuable  rulers 
 to  citizens'  political  affairs.  According  to  actual  Rousseau, 
 the  Abbe  Pierre  de  san  goodness  exaggerated  perceived  to 
 be  completed  at  the  invitation  to  the  conference  of  the 
 entire  recitation  items  formulated  for  a  lasting  peace,  and 
 signed  by  all  concerned.  He  goes  on  Rousseau  Analysis:  "We 
 can  not  say  has  not  been  implemented  the  scheme  because 
 it  bad,  but  made  it  impossible  to  implement  it  because  it 
 has  been  good,  owing  to  the  evil  and  abuse  in  normally 
 accompany  the  work  of  the  people.  What  is  useful  general 
 matter,  rarely  would  pave  the  way  out  of  the  force,  because 
 of  special  interests  are  almost  always  opposed  it.  There 
 is  no  doubt,  that  lasting  peace  is  now,  the  draft  absurdity. 
 Or  rather,  admiration  for  this  type  who  outline  very  beautiful, 
 each  other,  since  it  would  not  be  able  to  see  it  enter 
 into  force  of  the  day."  In  another  location,  launch  Rousseau 
 violent  attack  on  the  philosophy  of  political  than  in  his 
 book  entitled  The  famous  (  Chapter  40  of  the  travel  Ayub. 
 The  theory  of  coherent  tripartite  than  on  the  non-negotiable 
 separation:  usefulness  and  oppression.  For  him,  natural  situation 
 of  human  rights  is  the  ongoing  war.  Wolf  human  human  brother. 
 However,  the  instinct  to  survive  and  fear  of  death  because 
 of  continuing  conflict  imposed  on  the  use  of  a  social  contract 
 and  transfer  of  human  rights  to  society.  Only  the  absolute 
 power  in  a  position  to  ensure  that  such  transfer  of  rights. 
 Rousseau  attacking  this  theory.  For  him,  is  not  war  but 
 the  outcome  of  the  people  moral  corruption.  They  are  deadly 
 disease  which  gripped  by  social  and  political  body.  The  situation 
 and  physical  health  is  in  the  peace  process.  It  is  only 
 to  develop  all  social  body  cells  and  members  of  the  population 
 growth  is  necessary  through  development,  agricultural,  commercial. 
 The  unit  believed  peace  desired  peoples  happiness  in  every 
 society.  The  war,  on  the  contrary,  complete  the  states  of 
 their  peoples,  the  focus  havoc  on  the  throne  of  governance, 
 religions  silent  before  the  rights  and  humanitarian  acts  contrary 
 to  allow  the  war.  In  the  eyes  of  Rousseau,  whatever  the 
 extraordinary  victories  can  never  irreparable  harm  to  the 
 nation  of  its  nationals  during  the  war.  open  deep  wounds 
 heal  not  only  thanks  to  the  peace.  In  the  face  of  the 
 tide  of  violence,  was  also  contribution  by  German  philosophical 
 signed  in  the  minds  of  the  most  famous  during  his  article 
 "for  lasting  peace  draft  philosophical"  (1795).  Assisted  by 
 two  ideas  by  the  philosophy  of  history;  the  release  philosophical 
 planned  for  a  lasting  peace.  First,  the  conviction  that  the 
 development  of  better  inevitably  flow,  and,  secondly,  to  ensure 
 that  the  highest  run  by  the  forces  of  good  will  prevail 
 and  values  of  the  forces  of  evil.  If;  did  not  specify  the 
 accuracy  of  the  content  of  which  is  better  to  wait  for 
 humankind  itself,  by  the  demarcation  of  ambitious  human  intelligence 
 and  frameworks  comprehensive  university  is  a  good  idea  of 
 greater  political  community  which  had  been  achieved  through 
 full  alliance  that  will  bring  together  all  peoples  in  the 
 Republic  of  the  world,  and  remove  factors  already  appointed 
 by  the  explosion  of  the  conflicts  and  wars  and  lay-sponsored 
 peace  shown  religions  and  laws.  By  did  not  agree  to  all 
 ideas.  It  is  considered  a  proposal  by  the  states  of  the 
 Union  of  Self-rule  "transition,  for  peace,  according  to  his 
 view,  can  be  achieved  only  in  the  state  of  peoples.  this 
 lofty  goal,  each  state  should  undertake  a  process  where  injured 
 in  a  clear-cut  political  and  social  regime  would  be  fair 
 and  reasonable  input  to  the  organization  of  a  comprehensive 
 and  consistent  international  relations,  the"  state  of  the 
 peoples  ".  He  stressed  the  following  point:  "The  state-sponsored 
 internally  organized  unfair  inevitably  will  seek  to  the  looting 
 of  its  neighbours,  with  a  view  to  securing  the  kind  of 
 relaxation  of  its  citizens  oppressed,  access  to  new  resources 
 (...)  ".  The  owner  of  Jean-Paul  promising  prophecy  disappearance 
 is  imperative  that  the  war,  intensify  in  his  book  "The  declaration 
 of  war  on  the  war  (1809),  which  ended  the  war  is  that 
 the  killing  of  the  war.  In  excess  of  technological  development, 
 war  itself.  However,  this  prophecy  did  not  find  any  echoed 
 in  the  book  Carl  von  "in  the  war  (1831).  Consider  this 
 author,  signed  military  academy,  to  the  principle  of  the 
 war  in  positive  enter  as  a  key  element  in  the  political 
 action  and,  as  saying  that  the"  war  is  the  policy  pursued 
 by  other  means.  "While  the  Karl  Marx,  did  not  believe  that 
 the  war  is  a  candidate  to  continue  as  an  integral  part 
 of  the  Social  Political  action,  assigns  the  task  of  removal 
 of  the  Union  of  workers  across  the  border  they  alone  are 
 able  to  address  the  issue  of  violence  and  war.  As  for  the 
 dream  of  Freud's  elimination  of  violence  and  war  did  not 
 kill  any  link  to  the  fact,  it  is  unaware  of  the  basic 
 components  of  human  nature,  in  essence,  the  existing  contradictory 
 trends:  tendency  in  widespread  death  and  the  tendency  of 
 love,  i.e.  any  tendency  to  rapprochement  convergence.  According 
 to  his  vision,  it  is  impossible  to  eradicate  the  tendency 
 of  death  and  violence  in  human  nature,  and  the  maximum  possible 
 to  attain  these  destructive  power  was  to  turn  to  other  topics 
 to  be  safety  valve  for  natural  congestion.  crown  his  intervention 
 following  comment:"  All  is  to  contribute  to  the  growth  of 
 culture  to  the  detriment  of  the  interests  of  the  war.  To 
 conclude  that  there  are  ideas  which  were  submitted  to  the 
 dreams  of  serious  human  hard  in  the  inspection  was  pleased 
 to  note:  disgust  take  the  course  of  events  of  the  world 
 and  has  sought  to  overcome  self-reliance  for  the  better, 
 and  another  term  dream  of  a  society  full  dream  in  a  lasting 
 peace  between  peoples.  This  principle,  please  in  political 
 thought  blessed.  This  kind  of  thought,  flow  disrupted  in 
 times  of  controlled  by  the  type  of  relative  calm.  The  history 
 of  An,  while  showing  some  of  the  constant,  reflected  the 
 common  ground  stations  discrimination,  because  it  is  based 
 on  cultural  pension  of  socio-political  reality,  it  would  give 
 the  merits  of  the  interval  before  each  society  to  weave 
 dreams  and  aspirations  in  some  controlled  by  the  kind  of 
 freedom  of  deduction  belts,  without  being  subjected  to  the 
 ready-made  models  canning  effusion  thought  before.  As  that 
 of  the  question  of  peace  is  closely  related  to  intellectual 
 areas  rift  in  history.  Thus,  we  see  how  was  launched  in 
 dealing  with  the  cause  of  peace,  after  the  tension  made 
 sure  that  controlling  the  church  to  lead  the  battle  with 
 the  reform  of  the  scourge  of  accidents  entailed.  And  the 
 Netherlands  Grotius,  shortly  after  the  outbreak  of  war  30 
 years,  Father  de  Saint-Pierre,  at  the  end  of  the  bloody 
 rule  of  Louis  XIV,  ,  in  the  first  wars  of  the  revolution, 
 the  League  of  Nations  at  the  end  of  the  major  war,  and 
 the  Organization  for  the  United  Nations  at  the  end  of  the 
 Second  World  War.  Note  through  this  rapid  Overview  that  the 
 majority  of  contributions  to  the  theme  of  peace  pains  generated 
 from  the  womb  of  sadness,  therefore,  is  characterized  by. 
 Every  draft  is  based  on  the  previous,  adds  to  the  new  visions. 
 It  has  been  affected  by  the  De  Saint-Pierre  Rousseau,  two 
 together,  affected  by  the  president  Wilson,  a  manufacturer 
 of  the  League  of  Nations,  graffiti  by.  As  we  have  seen 
 above,  since  the  sixth  century  G.  M.  To  date,  there  has 
 been  some  considered  essential  to  bring  about  a  date  to 
 the  principle  of  the  conflict  as  an  engine  components  life. 
 Outside  the  conflict,  and  even  bloodshed,  not  the  life  and 
 development.  According  to  this  view,  is  another,  ethnically 
 and  culturally  different  religious,  political  and  a  threat 
 to  the  unity  and  cohesion  of  society,  limit  the  growth  of 
 various  ego.  From  here,  work  on  the  other  in  the  crucible 
 melting  this  unilateral  if  possible,  or  seek  to  marginalize 
 it  and  then  cancelled.  The  principle  of  this  conflict,  on 
 time,  the  history  of  the  tragic  human  calamities  which  reproduce 
 from  each  other  in  the  vicious  circle  of  violence.  In  the 
 face  of  an  ideological  war,  which  never  see  the  light  of 
 day  and  grow  in  the  embrace  of  meaningless,  shows  the  tide 
 of  spiritual  and  philosophical  based  on  peace,  which  find 
 their  way  to  consciences  and  minds  following  the  pace  of 
 time,  at  the  time  of  the  salvation  of  man  stumbling  in 
 the  West  and  quality.  This  trend  calls  for  the  passage  of 
 the  principle  of  adversity  contradiction  to  the  principle 
 of  complementarity,  which  would  lay  a  good  competitive  various 
 components  of  the  people  to  meet  some  of  them  with  one

 The  commission  issued  in  Beirut  committee  headed  by  Judge 
 Jamil  Bairam  and  membership  of  the  judges  Ghadah  advisers 
 will  help  to  practise  by  Imad  Qublan  resolutions  related 
 to  the  non-affiliated  to  any  of  the  unions  press  editors, 
 in  discussing  the  case  filed  by  MP  Nicola  Fattoush  on  colleague 
 George  Bashir  offence  of  slander  against  by  the  newspaper 
 articles  published  in  "homes"  with  2001  and  2002  on  the 
 cave,  arrogate  Bashir  the  status  of  a  lack  of  affiliation 
 to  any  of  the  journalist.  The  commission  concluded  that  the 
 outcome  of  the  committee  in  its  resolution  resolution  to 
 the  chief  investigating  magistrate  in  Beirut,  Hatem  Madi, 
 which  resume  Fattoush,  prosecutor  before  this  body  to  prevent 
 the  trial  of  Bashir  in  an  offence  carrying  out  the  status 
 of  a  lack  of  permanence.  The  commission  first  contradict 
 explanation  adopted  by  the  prosecutor  has  expanded  its  interpretation 
 on  the  basis  of  the  press  law  which  provides  for  the  conditions 
 for  the  exercise  of  press  profession  of  journalism,  among 
 its  members  implies  a  duty  to  join  the  union.  It  considered 
 that  the  expansion  of  the  interpretation  of  the  provisions 
 of  this  law  violates  the  principle  of  interpretation  of  the 
 penal  provisions  restrictive  interpretation.  The  decision  in 
 the  complaint,  the  first  investigator  was  considered  one  of 
 the  are  set  in  motion  a  claim  against  journalist.  With  reference 
 to  the  explanations  ended  the  journalist  had  not  been  able 
 to  cope  with  an  offence  carrying  out  the  status  of  the 
 significance  of  these  resolutions,  they  cover  the  prosecution 
 of  non-affiliated  to  the  Press  Syndicate  only  outside  the 
 scope  of  what  is  stipulated  in  the  press  law  and  to  submit 
 a  complaint  to  the  journalist.  This  is  resorting  to  explain 
 the  absence  of  an  explicit  provision  prevents  the  prosecution 
 of  journalist  this  offence.  The  commission  endorsed  the  decision 
 to  prosecute  Bashir  and  the  director-in-charge  in  the  past, 
 in  terms  of  print  Yusif  Al-Huwaik  criticism  prosecutor  and 
 the  prevention  of  crime  in  an  offence  slander  trial  about 
 the  lack  of  permanence.  According  to  explain  the  Commission 
 on  the  issue  of  carrying  out  capacity.  "At  the  base.  First, 
 in  fact,  this  body  found  after  an  audit  of  the  overall 
 circumstances  of  this  issue  as  follows  :  The  defendant  George 
 Bashir  exercise  journalist  working  for  more  than  30  years, 
 but  that  is  registered  in  the  press  association,  and  that 
 one  of  the  pillars  of  dawn  press  company,  which  has  the 
 Central  News  Agency,  the  agency  recorded  in  the  calendar 
 press  publications  licensed  to  participate  in  such  union  elections, 
 according  to  the  benefit  of  the  Press  Syndicate  in  the  history 
 of  the  20/2  /  2003.  It  was  found  that  the  defendant  has 
 been  mentioned  in  recent  homes  on  the  exercise  of  its  work 
 in  a  newspaper  journalist  wrote  several  articles  on  different 
 dates  dealt  with  the  prosecutor  by  Nicola  Fattouch  (...) 
 showed  that  the  deputy  prosecutor  Fattoush,  made  in  this 
 body,  appealed  to  summary  :  The  press  that  the  defendant 
 George  Bashir  exercise  a  profession  without  actually  take 
 to  possess  the  legal  requirements,  it  is  not  registered  in 
 one  of  the  press  or  editors  syndicates  does  not  hold  a 
 press  card,  which  is  accredited  to  their  homes  and  free 
 in  the  daily  newspaper,  exercised  by  the  press  for  more 
 than  30  years  near  defined  by  taking  the  title  of  a  journalist, 
 and  that  this  character  has  announced  publicly  in  his  articles. 
 The  resolution  appealed  erred  when  he  went  to  consider  that 
 there  is  no  requirement  to  be  written  in  a  newspaper  journalist 
 was  not  every  person  in  a  newspaper  written  press,  but  in 
 this  capacity,  which  is  only  given  to  those  who  had  been 
 registered  in  the  press  syndicate  or  in  the  Syndicate  of 
 editors  who  take  the  press  profession  has,  since  the  adoption 
 of  this  view  denies  every  possibility  for  an  offence  carrying 
 out  capacity,  and  jeopardized  the  application  of  Article  10 
 of  the  Press  Law  and  Article  35  of  the  decree-law  104/77 
 The  magistrate  erred  when  considering  that  only  affected  persons 
 from  carrying  out  one  of  the  status  of  a  journalist  is 
 one  of  the  syndicates,  editors  and  the  press  and  public 
 proceedings  in  one  of  spurious  rested  on  the  complaint,  because 
 arrogate  capacity  penal  offence,  another  offence  in  the  public 
 prosecutor  general  of  the  right  to  move  in  that  case,  it 
 would  also  be  the  right  of  any  other  person  suffered  damage 
 as  a  result  of  this  crime,  as  well  as  the  case  at  present, 
 the  right  to  initiate  proceedings  move  according  to  the  General 
 Authority  for  civil  proceedings.  The  legislator  if  he  wanted 
 to  limit  claim  sole  explicitly  states  that  the  union  would 
 also  act  on  the  alleged  offence  of  adultery  in  Article  498 
 of  the  penal  code  when  an  inventory  of  the  right  to  claim 
 spouse,  cover  even  the  public  prosecutor's  office  itself, 
 and  the  general  rule  is  applicable.  It  was  stipulated  in 
 Article  7  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  which  has  given 
 each  victim  of  any  offence  to  initiate  proceedings  for  the 
 general  right  to  demand  the  right  to  claim  compensation, 
 and  may  not  be  said  with  the  exception  to  this  rule  but 
 the  text  of  the  Open.  He  added  the  prosecutor  appealed  the 
 decision  also  resumed  erred  when  justified  to  prevent  the 
 trial  of  the  defendant  not  to  use  the  title  of  a  journalist 
 when  he  wrote  articles  complained  when  they  participated  in 
 the  interview  television  dismissed  because  it  was  signed  on 
 behalf  of  the  personal  mechanism  without  adding  any  capacity, 
 because  the  signed  article  personal  journalist  on  behalf  of 
 the  press,  without  adding  the  words  "press"  there  is  no 
 evidence  of  the  Non-arrogate  capacity  because  it  was  determined 
 to  press  the  actual  practice,  as  well  as  the  defendant  identified 
 himself  in  a  video  television  interview  in  the  file  that 
 brilliant  journalist  George  Bashir.  The  resolution  also  resumed 
 erred  when  considering  the  circumstances  that  just  because 
 the  defendant  wrote  articles  complained  of  them  have  not 
 given  itself  the  status  of  a  journalist  because  such  find 
 legal  source  in  the  process  of  affiliation  to  a,  because 
 the  articles  mentioned  are  not  isolated  many  articles  have 
 precedence  over  the  years  followed  by  several  well,  without 
 the  correct  defendant  developed  in  so  as  not  to  return  spurious 
 bench  (...).  As  a  result  of  the  expansion  of  the  investigation 
 carried  out  by  this  body,  indicating  that  the  defendant  George 
 Bashir  reported  to  the  interrogation  he  exercised  by  the 
 press  since  the  year  .1959  and  that  the  work  of  the  first 
 in  a  newspaper  and  magazine  incidents,  Radio  Monte  Carlo 
 in  Lebanon  television,  which  is  currently  written  in  a  newspaper 
 homes  run  by  the  Central  News  Agency  as  one  of  their  owners. 
 He  highlighted  several  documents  are  press  cards  conferred 
 on  the  work  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  and  several 
 media  organizations,  as  well  as  documents  proving  his  involvement 
 in  the  media  delegations  abroad,  in  matters  relating  to  the 
 press  conferences.  The  prosecutor  has  been  found  to  be  provided 
 as  a  result  of  the  expansion  of  the  investigation  of  the 
 memorandum  in  which  he  confirmed  earlier  statements  resume 
 attach  three  documents.  The  law:  (.  )  In  the  alleged  offence 
 arrogate  capacity:  As  legally  recognized  that  once  harm  arising 
 from  the  crime  and  it  is  for  each  damaged  the  right  to 
 establish  its  claim  for  compensation  of  penal  justice  personal 
 before  it  was  thus  set  in  motion  a  general  case,  and  that 
 this  right  is  not  blocked  a  particular  category  of  people, 
 and  cannot  therefore  be  limited  or  restricted  only  by  explicitly. 
 Accordingly,  contrary  to  what  he  has  gone  appealed  decision, 
 the  right  to  claim  an  offence  carrying  out  capacity  for 
 each  victim,  as  long  as  they  did  not  provide  legislator 
 to  limit  the  right  to  claim  such  professional  unions,  for 
 example,  the  press.  Since  the  offence  arrogate  requires  a 
 spur  to  Article  393  of  the  penal  code  to  be  spurious  capacity 
 has  conducted  without  the  right  of  the  profession  are  subject 
 to  a  certain  legal  system  and  the  text  is  the  same  French 
 law  contained  in  the  history  of  the  23  May  1942,  which 
 includes:  .,  ,  P.  E.  Since  the  legislator  had  transmitted 
 the  clear,  therefore,  to  determine  what  this  crime  to  the 
 legal  system,  which  are  subject  to  its  occupation,  which 
 set  the  terms  of  exercise  of  their  affiliation  to  it,  in 
 order  to  determine  whether  the  defendant  had  committed  an 
 offence  carrying  out  organizational  chaos  in  the  light  of 
 the  grade.  Since  some  occupations  have  made  the  requirement 
 of  affiliation  to  the  essential  and  necessary  without  any 
 person  who  did  not  have  the  right  for  the  exercise  of  this 
 profession  as  stated  in  Article  4  of  the  Organization  of 
 the  legal  profession  act  which  stipulates  that  could  be  a 
 lawyer  to  exercise  the  bar  in  Lebanon  if  his  name  registered 
 in  one  of  as  well  as  Article  2  of  the  law  regulating  the 
 profession  of  Engineering,  which  stipulates  that  no  one  has 
 the  right  to  exercise  a  profession  of  engineering  in  Lebanon 
 if  it  is  not  registered  in  one  of  name.  Otherwise,  that 
 is  otherwise  in  relation  to  the  exercise  of  the  profession 
 in  accordance  with  the  benefit  of  scrutiny  in  the  texts 
 of  the  press  law  14/9  /  1962  rate  under  Legislative  Decree 
 No.  104/77  Law  89/91,  330/94,  which  did  not  contain  a  similar 
 provision  texts  contained  in  the  organization  of  legal  professions 
 Engineering  and  the  legal  profession  in  terms  of  the  requirement 
 to  be  affiliated  to  the  press  association  journalist  to  have 
 the  right  of  the  exercise  of  this  activity.  Indeed,  the 
 revision  of  Article  10  of  the  law  on  publications  mentioned 
 it  shows  that  means  have  been  taken  by  the  press  profession 
 source  of  livelihood  for  him  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
 set  out  in  articles  .22  .23.  24  25  26  of  the  law.  Since 
 Article  22  of  the  law  provides  that  a  sample  must  be  available 
 in  the  press  as  defined  in  articles  10  and  11  following 
 conditions  :  The  Lebanese  should  be.  The  holder  would  be 
 at  least  the  second  section  Lebanese  baccalaureate  certificate 
 or  its  equivalent,  to  be  continuing  March  practice  journalist 
 working  for  four  years  following  the  acceptance  of  students 
 belonging  to  the  press,  or  to  be  in  the  press  ?  Leave 
 certificate  holder  exempts  pregnant  leave  from  graduation. 
 The  Be  enjoy  civil  and  political  rights.  The  practice  of 
 practising  without  any  other  profession,  in  accordance  with 
 the  assets  to  be  determined  by  the  rules  of  procedure.  Since 
 the  legislator,  therefore,  does  not  require  the  article  reported 
 that  the  journalist  belonging  to  the  Press  Association  as 
 a  precondition  for  substantive  did  not  have  the  right  of 
 the  exercise  of  this  activity  without  even  relieved  implicitly 
 licence  certificate  holders  in  the  press  to  have  a  duty 
 to  join  the  union.  Since  the  adoption  of  any  other  interpretation 
 would  lead  to  an  expansion  of  the  interpretation  of  these 
 texts,  which  is  contrary  to  the  principle  that  must  be  interpreted 
 in  explanation  of  exclusive  criminal  texts.  In  addition  to 
 make  it  an  offence  carrying  out  capacity,  like  any  other 
 offence  assumed  the  availability  of  pillars  material  can  be 
 achieved  as  a  result  of  the  feet  of  the  first  defendant 
 to  arrogate  false  capacity  and  enjoys  the  conditions  imposed 
 by  law  to  practice,  and  moral  will  be  available  as  a  result 
 of  a  tendency  to  deceive  people  despite  the  lack  of  knowledge 
 of  their  professional  competence  of  the  exercise  of  a  particular 
 activity.  ..  P.,  RR  E  E,.  ,  259.  It  is  currently  in  an 
 audit  of  all  the  papers  and  documents  contained  in  the  case 
 that  the  defendant  George  Bashir  had  exercised  effective  exercise

 in  various  international  conferences  and  delegations  abroad 
 to  spread  information  reputation  among  people  without  moving

 on  the  contrary,  the  commission  had  said  that  the  defendant 
 belongs  to  the  Central  News  Agency,  the  agency  recorded  in 
 the  calendar  publications  licensed  and  participate  in  the 
 press  syndicate  elections  as  such.  Since  this  body  sees  progress 
 based  on  the  mental  element  that  crime  investigator  in  carrying 
 out  non-capacity,  said  the  defendant  present  in  the  case, 
 because  it  did  not  prove  to  file  the  papers  will  already 
 have  tended  to  deceive  people  as  false,  since  many  of  the 
 official  and  media  institutions  had  contracted  by  as  his 
 statement,  and  the  press  syndicate  has  implicitly  acknowledged 
 the  actual  exercise  this  right  as  a  result  of  a  journalist 
 for  40  years  of  occupation  without  the  obstacles  to  the 
 union  to  do  so.  The  fact  that  the  commission  and  were  resumed 
 in  terms  of  explanation,  which  are  contrary  to  the  resolution

 namely,  to  prevent  the  trial  of  the  defendant  George  harbinger

 proceedings  filed  by  the  bank,  where  he  was  responsible  for 
 the  last  body  of  the  committee  that  a  decision  has  been 
 issued  in  Beirut  on  6/6  /  2002  served  to  prevent  the  trial 
 of  the  defendant  of  crimes  attributed  to  him  for  lack  of 
 evidence  on  the  availability  of  elements  of  some  of  these 
 crimes  and  the  waiver  of  the  case  in  terms  of  the  absence 
 of  some  elements  of  the  passage  of  time,  not  three,  leading 
 to  be  regarded  as  one  of  the  elements  of  the  crime  of 
 money  laundering,  and  the  illegality  of  the  funds  that  have

 the  evidence  in  the  file  to  the  director  of  the  company, 
 which  has  been  restricted  to  calculate  the  value  of  these 
 checks  had  participated  in  the  rigging  or  used  forged  with 
 the  knowledge  that,  or  that  it  had  benefited  from  illegal 
 funds  not  knowing  their  legitimacy,  as  well  as  it  did  not

 While  officials  people  flocked  to  the  "Holocaust"  plant,  which

 450  people  were  killed  and  wounded  in  3206,  is  still  pending 
 between  the  official  neglect  negligence.  It  seems  to  be  Held 
 Hostage-responsibilities  away  from  any  integrated  plan  to  deal 
 with  it.  Official  statistics  issued  by  the  Emergency  Committee 
 on  traffic  affairs  that  compared  with  the  number  of  incidents 
 between  the  years  2001  and  2002  show  a  rise  in  the  number 
 of  victims  at  a  rate  of  3.30  percent,  after  this  figure 
 in  2000  to  2001,  at  a  rate  of  3.10  percent.  The  study 
 indicates  that  the  vehicle  accidents  constitute  76.82  percent 
 of  the  total  accidents,  with  share  of  the  remaining  18.08 
 percent,  trucks,  bicycles  %.  These  figures  are  staggering 
 frequent  incidents  on  certain  points,  officials  at  the  Ministry 
 of  Interior  to  the  reasons  for  the  speed  and  lack  of  attention. 
 Produced,  according  to  the  chairman  of  the  Emergency  Committee 
 on  traffic  Affairs  Colonel  Joseph  al-Duwaihi  of  thoughtlessness 
 drivers.  "  He  added:  "The  ministry  (internal)  attaches  particular 
 importance  over  the  issue  of  Public  Safety,  which  maintains 
 total  campaigns,  with  the  Organization  of  the  traffic  control

 joint  venture  between  the  ministries  of  interior,  revealing

 accidents.  This  project,  which  is  still  a  prisoner  school 
 space  awaiting  funding,  accompanied  by"  Fever  "campaigns  carried 
 out  by  the  ministry  in  conjunction  with  different  actors. 
 As  well  as  provide  Minister  Elias  Murr  draft  law  regulating 
 traffic  affairs  finally  career  path  of  the  House  of  Representatives. 
 According  to  strict  measures  in  the  most  important  articles 
 transgressors  up  some  of  them  to  the  prison  sentence  and 
 the  withdrawal  of  licence  for  the  market.  But  what  is  really 
 interesting  is  the  fact  that  none  of  the  ministries  concerned 
 with  the  subject  of  the  move  did  not  participate  in  the 
 drafting  of  this  project  or  in  its  discussions,  the  lack 
 of  coordination  between  ministries  concerned,  carry  activists 
 in  the  private  sector,  primary  responsibility  for  the  high 
 number  of  incidents.  In  this  context,  was  in  charge  of  "bring 
 together  young  people  social  awareness-("  Ziiad  Akl  that" 
 any  plan  to  reduce  traffic  accidents  should  adopt  a  rule 
 "highlighting  the  role  of  the  parties  represented  in  engineering, 
 namely,  the  Ministry  of  Works  and  the  Council  for  Development 
 and  Reconstruction  (  CDR),  as  well  as  education  through  the 
 role  of  associations  and  the  media,  in  addition  to  the  emergency

 Committee  of  the  Red  Cross.  In  addition  to  these  actors 
 rating  application  of  the  law  to  examine  the  effectiveness 
 of  the  campaign."  complain  that  the  public  safety  and  prevention 
 measures  around  the  emerge  from  the  application  of  the  law. 
 That  way  to  obtain  a  licence  in  Lebanon  are  market  scandal 
 in  full,  "he  said  cuts  traffic  control  and  allocation  of 
 funds  is  part  of  the  fund  a  holistic  judges  rather  than 
 be  used  in  the  maintenance  of  roads,  and  the  issuance  of 
 Inaccurate  statistics  to  reduce  the  volume  of  the  problem 
 as  well  as  on-the  responsibilities  of  ministries,  clearly 
 shows  that  the  crisis  is  not  dealt  with  ways  of  serious 
 ".  In  parallel  with  the  above-mentioned  factors,  have  highlighted 
 the  case  of  roads  an  integral  part  of  the  crisis  "Black 
 tunnel."  came  thunderstorms  storms,  and  heavy  rains  which 
 took  place  in  Lebanon,  finally,  reveal  hidden,  clear  to  in 
 appalling  conditions.  Landslides  digging  and  methods  of  dark 
 international  insignia  on  the  measurement  of  municipalities, 
 seasonal  maintenance  projects  do  not  take  into  account  any 
 of  the  terms  of  public  safety,  turn  with  the  leadership 
 of  the  car  in  some  places  is  similar  to  attempt  to  commit 
 suicide.  These  facts  are  still  not  capable  of  effective  remedies, 
 especially  in  light  of  the  budget  allocated  to  the  Department 
 of  Public  Works.  According  to  the  passage  of  European  unity 
 engineer  at  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  Omar  Atallah,  "examination 
 of  the  roads  in  Lebanon  indicate  the  systemic  problems  ", 
 pointing  out  that"  subject  to  the  maintenance  of  roads  for 
 more  than  one  in  every  time  a  lead  to  chaos  rampant  makes 
 it  impossible  to  determine  responsibilities  ".  He  pointed 
 out  that  "the  study  of  the  cost  of  a  traffic  accident  rate 
 economically  through  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  might  be  the 
 solution  to  this  issue  will  be  given  sufficient  importance 
 ",  pointing  out  that"  the  ministry  (Works)  completed  a  number 
 of  studies  for  the  development  of  roads  and  circulated  to 
 all  concerned,  however,  remain  subject  to  the  application. 
 "  The  management  of  a  series  of  flood  death  almost  daily 
 on  the  roads  of  Lebanon,  to  detect  a  real  crisis  faced 
 by  citizens  in  clearly  shows  that  neglect  and  the  responsibility 
 of  the  loss  of  life  of  people  still  Sir  position.

 If  the  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  awarded  the  Nobel 
 Peace  Prize,  will  be  thanks  to  the  positions  of  the  Arab 
 world.  a  man,  who  can  only  play  the  role  of  "intermediary" 
 The  effects  of  the  wounds  between  the  West  and  the  Arab 
 world,  has  allowed  for  the  position  of  France  in  the  Palestinian-Israeli 
 conflict  and  currently  in  the  war  on  Iraq,  to  receive  the 
 confidence  of  all  Arabs.  These  sentiments,  across  Egyptian 
 writer  and  journalist  Ahmad  Yusuf,  the  newspaper,  Al-Ahram 
 Cairene  in  Paris,  expressed  the  opinion  of  many  intellectuals 
 and  politicians  Arabs  living  in  France  and  other  countries 
 in  the  world,  such  as  the  issuance  of  his  book  "Jacques 
 Chirac  and  the  east,"  the  Dar  French,  which  was  disclosed 
 in  the  French  language  and  twenty-hundred  pages  on  the  myth 
 of  close  relations  between  Chirac  and  the  east,  which  stems 
 from  the  very  old  links  between  France  and  the  Arab  world, 
 and  secret  admiration  personality  Arab  Chirac  Arab  positions, 
 which  has  become  a  man  just  west  ",  as  well  as  the  author's 
 semi-political  picture  of  Chirac's  Middle  East  that  has  been 
 marked  by  princes,  which  has  long  eastern  imagination,  reflecting 
 attributes  of  influence.  Thanks  to  the  careful  examination 
 of  the  policy  of  France  in  the  Arab  world,  has  been  able 
 to  Ahmad  Yusuf,  winner  of  a  certificate  from  the  Sorbonne 
 University  on  Egypt's  image  in  the  French  supposed  ",  was 
 accompanied  by  diverse  culture,  which  are  articles  as  a  reference 
 to  reflect  the  nature  of  this  eastern  personal  hidden  in 
 the  French  president,  which  was  monitored  by  the  author  of 
 his  time  in  the  Middle  East,  which  he  analysed  the  speech 
 in  Cairo,  Beirut  and  in  Jerusalem,  and  explore  movements. 
 In  a  study  on  the  personality  of  "friend  of  Arabs,"  he 
 said:  "If  it  is  not  an  easy  personal  Jacques  Chirac,  but 
 it  is  very  similar  to  personal  Caesar"  ",  on  the  one  hand 
 and  humanitarian  policy  on  the  other  hand.  People's  image 
 With  the  deterioration  of  the  Palestinian-Israeli  peace  process, 
 it  appeared  Chirac  in  the  eyes  of  the  Arab  public  opinion 
 western  only  force  capable  of  restoring  a  sort  of  balance, 
 is  distinct  from  Israel's  unconditional  support  of  the  United 
 States.  Thus,  the  image  of  Chirac  in  the  Arab  capitals, 
 with  the  passage  of  time,  more  popular  heads  of  some  Arab 
 kings.  In  addition,  important  elements:  personal  relations, 
 which  French  president,  with  some  Arab  leaders  and  politicians, 
 policy  heritage  Arab-French.  This  political  approach  can  be 
 seen  as  a  token  of  friendship  to  the  Arabs  were  absolute, 
 as  reflected  in  their  minds  to  maintain  a  balance  in  the 
 diplomatic  complex  conflict,  in  particular,  "according  to  the 
 right  as  repeat  former  president  Mitterrand,  but  careful  consideration 
 of  matters  to  show  that  this  policy  of  France  is  not  one 
 of  the  Arab  inspiration,  and  does  not  constitute  a  major 
 part  of  the  struggles  of  General  de  Gaulle,  which  is  much 
 more  senior  and  has  its  roots  in  the  foundations  for  French 
 diplomacy.  The  writer  says:  "What  is  new  and  raises  the 
 admiration  of  Arabs  is  Chirac's  personality,  how  states  welcoming 
 reception  of  the  leaders  of  the  totality  of  the  people, 
 the  meeting.  In  fact,  the  spontaneous  edition  and  prestige 
 demonstrating  assist.  There  is  no  doubt  that  these  advantages 
 delight  by  Arabs  who  belong  to  a  culture  of  Given  the  importance 
 of  external  appearance.  In  addition  to  the  fascination  of 
 creation  of  the  French  president  equitable  position  that  it 
 is  time-honoured  French  heritage.  Thus,  Chirac"  a  man  just 
 west  ",  such  as  the  hero  of  legendary  stories.  "  "Jacques 
 Chirac  with  the  Arab  world  a  long  story.  He  wanted  or  ABI. 
 This  live  the  French  president,  by  virtue  of  its  position, 
 the  story  of  the  millennium  with  common  Arab  civilization, 
 Arab  policy  that  we  are  talking  about  it  today  is  not  in 
 fact  a  long  common  history  of  the  highest  stage.  Jacques 
 Chirac  is  not  contrary  to  this  legacy  of  French-marvelous 
 Arab,  on  the  contrary,  it  personality  overall  view  with  other 
 civilizations,  alien-loving  countries  and  the  identification 
 and  travel,  this  romantic  in  the  third  millennium."  The  book 
 focuses  on  two  fronts  symbolic  president  of  France,  because 
 I  face  belongs  to  Arab  traditions  in  French  policy,  and 
 one  depicts  heresy  exclusively  in  types  and  complex  dimensions. 
 "If  we  go  back  date  back  to  old  and  tried  to  draw  this 
 relationship,  to  show  us  that  there  were  many  political  projects 
 ranging  from  I  even  Arabism  kingdom  via  the  Arab  Dream, 
 which  was  established  by  Napoleon  III.  And  this  relationship 
 and  prepare  for  this  book  written  Jean-intellectual  Ghassan 
 Tweini  political  partner  in  the  book  "nonexistence  Century 
 ",  on  24  February  last  year  before  the  outbreak  of  war 
 on  Iraq  :  "Is  Only  here  to  welcome  the  leader  of  the  policy 
 I  until  the  beginning  of  the  month  of  May  2002  in  connection 
 with  the  cold  ?  The  positions  of  the  French  President  Jacques 
 Chirac  throughout  the  crisis  between  the  United  States  under 
 the  chairmanship  of  President  George  Bush,  with  the  vast 
 majority  of  the  peoples  of  the  world,  was  of  paramount  importance, 
 cannot  be  ignored,  as  long  as  the  diplomatic  what  the  United 
 States"  Old  Europe  would  prefer  the  logic  of  acute  madness, 
 outweigh  edge  policy  on  the  logic  of  the  fighting,  and  balance 
 in  the  colonial  an  authoritarian  tendencies.  The  historic 
 events  which  took  place  in  the  relations  between  France  and 
 the  Arab  world  staggering  from  positive  San  Luis  crusade 
 to  and  Louis  XIV  to  draft  II  Arab  Kingdom,  France  case 
 to  De  Gaulle,  referred  to  in  this  book,  for  the  first  time, 
 the  French  language,  a  correspondent  with  Gamal  Abdel  Nasser. 
 And  in  this  context,  the  draft  Abd  al-Nasser's  visit  to 
 Paris,  which  is  long.  The  relations  between  France  in  times 
 of  grandeur  and  east,  and  had  been  exemplary  in  this  book, 
 it  is  not  important.  As  said:  "The  virtues  lost  in  the 
 midst  of  interests,  such  as  rivers  in  the  sea."  It  is  difficult 
 when  applied  to  individuals,  but  just  when  we  mean  by  states. 
 Thus,  it  was  for  property  relations  then  empires  after  French 
 republics  with  various  Arab  societies.  History,  however,  thus 
 making,  and  combining  state  de  Mustafa  full  consideration 
 was  bright  with  great  admiration  shares  ".

 ",  teach  others  even  those  assigned  to  adopt  new  name,  view 
 in  the  name,  everyone  him.  The  three  or  four  female  teachers 
 in  various  schools,  members  or  friends  of  the  movement,  Idea 
 new  name  among  pupils.  The  joy  of  these  large  with  the 
 word  ".  "They  have  become,  since  then,  they  say  the  owner 
 of  shop"  "interrogate,  child"  What  is  known  that  we  have 
 changed  the  name  of  the  Ras  al-Abd  and  necessary  remained, 
 such  as  the  company  has  grown  Ghandour,  and  racism  against 
 blacks.  "Smile  idea,  immediately  notify  in  Pale  song"  Abdou 
 and  other  what  Biddo  ".  The  information  in  television  and 
 radio  links  (the  clever  report  "For  example,  of  racism,  1998), 
 told  the  idea  of  the  amendment  proposal  on  the  initiative 
 and  name  an  alternative.  -  In  conferences  on  human  rights 
 and  racism,  we  are  examples  of  "the  head  of  the  slave" 
 Fire  idea  to  give  such  as  on  the  face  of  racism  and  popular 
 simple  ideas  to  the  people  (for  example,  the  conference  in 
 Jordan  in  2001  in  preparation  for  the  World  Summit  Against 
 Racism).  The  meetings  in  sensitizing  youth  associations  and 
 the  other  members  of  the  university  students  in  many  parts 
 of  Lebanon,  the  idea  has  become  known,  first  name  alternative 
 preferable  to  everyone.  The  year  2002,  returned  to  seriously 
 consider  an  alternative  to  release  the  name,  requested  that 
 a  lawyer  is  a  member  of  the  movement  of  people's  rights 
 "to  prepare  legal  file  on  how  to  amend  the  name  of  a  product 
 and  the  cost  of  that.  The  goals  of  the  proposed  amendment

 cost  of  the  semi-free),  but  the  special  circumstances  many 
 occupations  have  prevented  us  from  the  implementation  of  these 
 steps.  Now  that  I  am  concerned,  to  work  together  in  order 
 to  give  first  initiative  (since  1995)  right,  on  behalf  of 
 the  late  moral  right  to  propose  an  alternative  name  like 
 everyone.  He  said  it  on  behalf  of,  in  a  timely  manner, 
 has  not  been  chosen,  he  said,  adding:  "On  behalf  of  the 
 top  of  the  slave-related  Ghandour,  any  company  Ghandour,  we 
 must  find  a  name  to  maintain  this,  at  the  same  time,  we 
 find  him  popular  word  Lebanese  heritage  of  ancient  people

 ""  to  "to  share  in  launching  this  amendment,  the  initiative 
 of  respect  for  each  of  us,  appreciating,  welcoming  the  referendum,
