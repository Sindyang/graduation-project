 Omar  /  Jordan  Tourism  Committee  chairman,  Mr  Fok  said  here 
 on  the  first  in  the  past  23  years,  the  volatile  situation 
 in  the  Middle  East,  some  international  terrorist  attacks  on 
 Iraq  as  well  as  the  current  fighting  has  been  severely  affected 
 the  tourism  industry  in  Jordan  in  Jordan  is  now  almost  little 
 foreign  tourists.  Mr  Fok,  in  an  interview  with  Xinhua  on 
 the  same  day,  the  Jordanian  capital  Amman  hotel  to  hotel 
 by  several  foreign  journalists,  United  Nations  agencies  and 
 international  aid  workers  and  the  arrival  of  good  business, 
 the  occupancy  rate  was  generally  low.  Jordan  famous  tourist 
 destination  Petra  now  have  three  restaurants  have  closed  down, 
 the  past  this  every  day  more  than  3,000  western  tourists 
 who  frequented  the  world-famous  ancient  city,  now  at  least 
 a  day  when  only  receive  three  Western  tourists.  The  Jordanian 
 Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Antiquities  statistics,  Jordan  major 
 tourist  sources  from  the  Arab  countries,  followed  by  Europe, 
 Israel  and  the  Americas.  In  2000,  tourism  to  Jordan  Arab 
 tourists  to  770,000  visitors,  followed  by  326,000  tourists 
 from  Europe,  the  Israeli  136,000  and  126,000  American,  2002, 
 the  number  of  visitors  from  Arab  countries  rose  to  1.131 
 million  visitors  and  tourists  from  Europe  declined  to  167,000 
 Israeli  tourists  declined  to  161,000,  the  Inter-American  tourists 
 only  73,000.  Mr  Fok  said  that  since  September  2000  Palestinian-Israeli 
 bloody  clashes  began  after  beginning  the  tourism  industry 
 in  Jordan.  "9.11"  After  the  incident,  Jordan's  tourism  industry 
 have  more  fight,  then  60%  of  the  cancelled  tourist  visits 
 to  Jordan.  After  that,  Jordan  has  taken  some  measures  to 
 attract  more  tourists  to  Jordan  in  the  Arab  countries  to 
 cover  the  shortage  of  western  tourists  reduced  Jordan's  tourism 
 industry  was  able  to  maintain  the  balance.  Mr  Fok  said  that 
 since  September  2002  the  United  States  has  threatened  to 
 use  force  against  Iraq  and  military  build-up  in  the  Gulf 
 region,  many  western  countries  warned  nationals  against  travel 
 to  the  Middle  East,  Jordan  Tourism  is  deteriorating.  He  noted 
 that  the  tourism  industry  accounted  for  8.5%  of  the  gross 
 domestic  product  in  Jordan  by  Jordan's  second  largest  source 
 of  foreign  exchange,  Jordan  and  11%  of  the  workforce  survival 
 dependent  on  tourism  in  the  region  and  this  led  to  the 
 volatile  situation  in  the  emerging  tourism  industry  in  Jordan 
 this  serious  situation,  you  can  imagine  the  impact  on  the 
 Jordanian  economy.  Mr  Fok  said  that  in  view  of  this  situation, 
 the  Jordanian  government  has  adopted  some  measures  to  assist 
 Jordan's  tourism  industry,  such  as  tourism  enterprises  extend 
 debt  service  relief  from  interest  on  loans  and  reduce  tourist 
 tickets  and  reduce  tourism  value-added  tax.  In  addition,  the 
 Jordanian  tourism  sector  in  the  Arab  countries  tourism  promotion 
 activities,  and  also  planned  in  Russia  and  Eastern  Europe 
 and  in  Japan  and  China  and  other  conflict-affected  areas 
 of  relatively  small  new  source  markets  in  order  to  revitalize 
 the  tourism  industry.  However,  he  also  pointed  out  that  the 
 plan  will  help  open  up  new  markets  have  been  fighting  the 
 duration  of  Iraq.  If  the  war  delay,  the  Jordanian  economy 
 will  further  damage,  which  will  probably  be  delayed.  Mr  Fok 
 against  Iraq  once  the  fighting  has  subsided  expressed  optimism 
 about  prospects  for  future  tourism  industry  in  Jordan.  He 
 said  that  once  the  fighting  has  subsided,  the  Jordanian  tourism 
 sector  will  introduce  a  new  plan,  including  increased  advertising, 
 lower  taxes,  reduce  airfares  and  hotel  accommodation  prices, 
 with  a  view  to  strengthening  the  competitiveness  of  tourism 
 industry  in  Jordan.
