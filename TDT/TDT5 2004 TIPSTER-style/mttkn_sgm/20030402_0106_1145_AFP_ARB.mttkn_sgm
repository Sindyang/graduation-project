 Arab  and  foreign  music  radio  broadcast  news  bulletins  and 
 other  programmes  such  as  the  free  trade  zone,  which  aspires 
 to  be  a  forum  for  democracy  in  the  Arab  world.  A  new  programme 
 will  be  broadcast  in  the  next  few  days  devoted  to  Iraq,

 funds  financed  by  an  American  official,  ambition  to  be  broadcast 
 first  in  the  Arab  world,  especially  with  the  start  of  the 
 war  on  Iraq  ?  According  to  war,  "We  are  not  funnel  the 
 system.  We  are  funded  by  the  Congress  of  the  taxpayers'

 The  American  government  agencies  to  ensure  the  independence 
 of  the  American  Radio  protect  themselves  from  any  interference 
 in  its  work.  At  the  same  time,  but  emphasized  that  "the 
 official  position  is  the  value  of  the  American  administration's 
 position  as  an  important  part  of  any  story,  but  it  is  not 
 the  only  one  we  are  keen  to  incorporate  the  views  of  other 
 parties  ".  He  says  that  "the  natural  relationship  between

 of  confidence.  We  must  not  allow  the  enterprise  or  article 
 to  take  advantage  of  the  information  from  the  different  parties.

 credibility  of  the  room,  sometimes  through  liberalization  does 
 not  broadcast  by  the  News  ".  He  added  that  "Arab  listener

 the  American  policy,  but  our  purely  information  ".  It  is 
 almost  radio  journalists  from  all  Arab  countries  as  it  seeks 
 to  further  expansion  and  deployment  in  the  Arab  world.  Future

 year  2004  and  the  additional  budget  requested  by  US  President

 and  the  United  Kingdom)  significantly  wrong."  He  added  that 
 such  false  accounts  "not  only  in  relation  to  the  military 
 resistance  is  likely  to  express  the  Iraqi  army  but  also

 built  to  teach  the  accounts,  but  one  of  the  tests  now, 
 after  14  days  (of  war)  accounts  that  had  been  seriously 
 flawed  ".  He  said  that  because  of  lack  of  consent  by  the 
 United  Nations  to  military  action  to  oppose  Most  of  the 
 world's  nations  of  the  war  on  Iraq,  the  only  conclusion 
 that  one  can  come  out  is  that  this  was  a  mistake  ".  In

 cease-fire  Sinha  said  that  New  Delhi  in  contact  with  the 
 United  Nations  and  many  governments  to  examine  the  issue. 
 However,  he  said,  "it  is  not  only  a  question  to  provide 
 advice,  but  also  the  question  of  the  means  to  be  done  through

 of  the  Security  Council  to  take  the  initiative  and  may  issue 
 a  decision  to  stop  fighting."  However,  he  said  he  believed 
 that  those  countries  that  supported  the  war,  which  is  not

 By  Jean-Louis  Washington  4-2  (AFP)  -  US  President  George 
 W.  Bush  accused  the  Democratic  Opposition  sacrifice  land  protection 
 for  American  war  on  Iraq  Inadequate  budget  request  to  a 
 large  extent,  in  their  view,  to  combat  terrorism  within  the 
 United  States.  In  the  Senate  Minority  Leader  said  Democratic 
 Senator  Tom  said  that  "the  war  against  terrorism  fronts." 
 He  said  he  was  speaking  during  a  press  conference  in  which 
 he  proposed  to  double  the  amount  proposed  by  Bush's  internal 
 security  to  nine  billion  dollars,  and  believes  that  the  Democrats 
 a  solid  Bush  in  this  area  are  not  political.  He  added: 
 "We  must  show  greater  vigilance  and  caution  and  to  allocate 
 adequate  funds  to  combat  terrorism  in  our  territory  and  abroad 
 ",  pointing  out  that  a  number  of  Republicans  shared  the 
 concern  that  the  Democrats.  However,  the  senator,  which  represents 
 the  mandate  of  the  South  Dakota  refrained  from  criticism 
 to  Bush's  war  immediately  for  fear  of  being  accused  by  opponents 
 that  the  Republican  national  feeling  in  the  midst  of  the 
 war  against  Iraq.  In  response  to  a  question  about  the  criticisms 
 made  by  the  press  on  military  strategy,  said  he  would  simply 
 by  saying  that  "soldiers  are  doing  excellent  work"  echoing 
 echoes  reassuring  cited  by  the  Bush  administration.  Additional 
 funds  requested  by  Democrats  aims  to  strengthen  the  means 
 of  police  and  fire  extinguishers  and  emergency  services  in 
 cities  and  towns  throughout  the  country,  which  are  to  show 
 greater  sensitivity  towards  the  Americans  since  the  attacks 
 of  11  September  .2001  Democratic  demand  additional  budget 
 amendment  contained  in  the  volume  of  74.4  billion  dollars, 
 which  Bush's  request  to  Congress  last  week  to  finance  the 
 war,  because  the  White  House  did  not  ask  for  only  $4.25 
 billion  dollars  in  addition  to  national  security.  Senator 
 Hillary  Clinton  was  involved  in  the  amendment  to  the  amounts 
 are  sensitive  to  cope  with  the  situation  internally  in  the 
 United  States  about  the  attacks  and  to  improve  the  means 
 to  respond  to  be  distributed  according  to  the  proportion 
 of  population  and  the  special  needs  of  the  city  like  New 
 York,  Washington,  where  increased  risks  of  terrorist  attacks. 
 He  drew  the  Democrats  in  the  House  of  Representatives  of 
 the  majority  of  the  republic  that  Bush  accusations  that  he 
 was  interested  in  internal  security  less  than  demand  by  the 
 members  of  his  government.  Democrat  MP  David  it,  a  member 
 of  the  main  committee  Democrats  in  budgets,  "George  Bush 
 to  try  to  respond  to  the  needs  of  the  funding  of  internal 
 security  by  obtaining  statements  images."  He  added:  "The  Republicans 
 are  exerting  efforts  to  provide  the  maximum  amount  of  dollars 
 to  fund  the  process  of  reducing  taxes"  of  the  value  of 
 725  billion  dollars  over  10  years  as  proposed  by  Bush,  which 
 was  adopted  by  parliament  last  week.  In  contrast,  announced 
 the  Senate  by  some  Republicans  that  he  supported  the  reduction 
 of  these  tax  gift  to  half  (350  billion  dollars)  because 
 it  favoured  the  richest  Americans,  especially  in  terms  of 
 the  abolition  of  double  taxation  on  profits.  For  his  part, 
 Bush  will  continue  to  stress  the  linkage  between  the  war 
 in  Iraq  and  the  fight  against  terrorism  abroad  inside.  It 
 was  announced  last  Monday  during  his  visit  to  Philadelphia 
 that  "after  the  attack  on  our  nation  on  11  September  .2001 
 decided  to  wait  until  hit  only  America's  enemies  before  moving 
 against  them."  Jess  /  mi  /  or  Moi  /

 of  application  of  the  Law  of  the  "universal  jurisdiction, 
 which  may  lead  to  a  resumption  of  the  proceedings  against 
 Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  before  a  Belgian  court. 
 Under  the  text,  which  was  adopted  by  parliament  during  the 
 meeting  of  the  whole  of  its  members,  Minister  of  Justice 
 in  a  position  in  some  cases,  with  the  consent  of  the  government 
 to  refer  the  issue  of  the  district  of  the  State  of  Origin

 against  humanity.  The  text  of  the  law  has  yet  to  receive 
 the  approval  of  the  Senate  in  the  coming  days,  in  principle, 
 to  apply  this  procedure,  which  calls  for  the  Belgian  diplomatic 
 officials,  Israel  and  the  United  States.  Washington  has  exerted 
 great  pressure  to  Belgium  over  the  past  few  weeks  in  this 
 regard.  The  law  of  universal  jurisdiction  of  the  year  1993, 
 allows  Belgian  courts  to  consider  the  issues  of  war  crimes, 
 genocide  and  crimes  against  humanity,  wherever  they  were  committed 
 whatever  the  nationality  of  the  perpetrators  or  victims.  Under 
 this  law,  provided  more  than  30  complaints  against  the  leaders

 responsibility  in  the  camps  of  Sabra  and  Shatila  massacres 
 carried  out  by  Lebanese  Christian  militia  loyal  to  Israel 
 in  1982.  Last  month  also  filed  a  complaint  against  the  former 
 American  President  George  W.  Bush  on  the  American  bombardment 
 of  Iraq  during  the  Gulf  War  in  .1991  A  first  version  of 
 the  draft  amendment  to  the  law  was  approved  by  the  Commission 
 on  the  judiciary  in  the  House  of  Representatives  of  the 
 Belgian  state  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  intervention  by 
 the  Minister  of  Justice  in  the  complaints  had  been  made 
 after  1  July  .2002  Although  the  draft  law,  the  father  of 
 the  American  president  set  free  from  the  current  complaints, 
 but  to  allow  the  prosecution  of  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel 
 Sharon  in  Belgium  at  the  end  of  its  mandate  at  the  head 
 of  the  Israeli  government  has  waived  his  immunity.  The  latest

 By  Hugh  Paris  4-2  (AFP)  -  The  French  government  is  increasingly 
 concerned  that  the  opposition  People's  war  on  Iraq  to  the 
 work  of  the  hostile  to  the  United  States  and  Britain  or 
 acts  of  violence  against  Jews,  particularly  among  Arabs  in 
 the  areas  inhabited  by  many  immigrants.  Despite  the  fact 
 that  the  opposition  to  French  President  Jacques  Chirac  of 
 the  war  on  Iraq  constituted  an  important  factor  in  defusing 
 the  tension  within  France,  where  the  support  of  about  90 
 per  cent  of  the  people,  the  authorities  fear  that  a  long 
 war  on  Iraq  and  the  rising  number  of  casualties  light  emotions 
 among  the  five  million  Muslims  living  in  France.  Among  the 
 indicators  to  the  escalation  of  hostile  feelings  of  the  United 
 States  and  Jewish  writings  that  appear  on  the  walls  in  the 
 slums  of  cities  as  well  as  the  impact  of  demonstrations 
 in  major  Arab  groups  who  bear  signs  and  fired  anti-war  slogans 
 supporting  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein.  The  unidentified 
 last  Thursday  by  distorting  the  cemetery  British  war  dead 
 in  the  first  world  war  north  France  chart  hooked  cross  the 
 words  written  request  from  the  British  ",  which  refuses  to 
 remove  our  soil,  has  been  a  few  days  earlier,  a  group  of 
 Jewish  leftist  beaten  with  iron  bars  in  the  process  of  hostile 
 to  the  war  in  Paris.  A  senior  official  in  the  interior 
 ministry  said  in  an  interview  with  the  newspaper  had  published 
 today  Wednesday  that  "anti-American  sentiments  are  growing 
 in  poor  neighbourhoods  could  turn  out  to  be  a  source  of 
 real  concern  ".  He  added:  "The  media  coverage  failures  the 
 coalition  forces  in  Iraq  is  fed  into  a  sort  of  delusion 
 see  policemen  on  the  ground  every  day.  It  could  cause  a 
 spark  in  the  transformation  of  the  hostile  feelings  towards 
 Americans  to  forms  of  violence  can  be  controlled."  It  seems 
 that  the  French  government  suffered  a  surprise  when  an  opinion 
 poll  showed  in  the  newspaper  if  Mond  "yesterday  that  about 
 one  third  of  French  people  want  to  lose  the  United  States 
 and  the  United  Kingdom,  the  war  in  Iraq.  He  said  almost 
 half  of  them  that  they  want  to  win  the  allies  of  war. 
 While  Chirac  did  not  indicate  any  statements  made  by  a  few 
 days  ago,  Prime  Minister  Jean-Pierre  has  tried  to  curb  popular 
 sentiment  yesterday  Tuesday  reminding  France  "that  did  not 
 choose  the  enemy  mistake"  He  said,  "We  believe  that  the 
 war  option  bad  (...)  but  the  Americans  are  not  enemies. 
 We  war  does  not  mean  that  we  want  to  win  a  dictatorship 
 to  democracy.  That  is  camp  democracy."  On  the  other  hand, 
 he  said  a  close  associate  of  Chirac,  told  Agence  France 
 Presse:  "How  can  we  hope  to  think  about  anything  other  than 
 the  defeat  of  Saddam  Hussein  and  the  victory  of  the  Americans, 
 even  if  we  disagree  with  them  on  whether  military  intervention 
 is  the  appropriate  option  ".  The  French  government  has  failed 
 so  far  to  express  its  unequivocal  support  for  American  and 
 British  forces,  which  France  believes  that  it  is  waging  war 
 against  illegal,  assistant  Chirac's  statements  reflect  the 
 concern  of  the  hostile  feelings  towards  the  United  States 
 to  pull  out  of  control.  Concern  has  played  the  French  government 
 of  the  reaction  of  large  numbers  of  Arabs,  mostly  of  immigrants 
 from  North  Africa,  a  key  role  to  play  in  France's  opposition 
 to  the  war  in  which  the  government  believes  that  shake  the 
 stability  of  the  Middle  East  and  make  the  public  opinion 
 more  stringent.  Officials  warned  of  the  war  against  terrorism 
 will  increase  the  number  of  adhering  to  the  extremist  Islamic 
 groups  already  stationed  in  France  and  other  parts  of  Europe, 
 which  is  likely  that  they  were  currently  targets  splitting 
 or  the  use  of  chemical  weapons  or  suicide  attacks  in  the 
 attack.  Chirac  war  because  of  the  opposition  is  likely  to 
 rule  out  the  objectives  of  those  attacks  French  figures, 
 however,  the  United  States  exposed,  according  to  officials. 
 Security  measures  have  been  strengthened  not  only  on  the 
 American  Embassy,  but  on  the  eastern  Greenland  Disney  Stores 
 around  the  capital,  and  even  books  in  English.  Commits  /

 than  one  half  of  the  victory  "Arab  people's  memory,  but 
 it  will  be  open  to  the  system  of  Baghdad,  while  another 
 analyst's  view  that  the  objective  of  the  United  States  in 
 the  war  is  far  from  Iraq."  Abdel-Khaliq  Abd  Al-allah,  professor 
 of  political  science  at  the  University  of  Ghana  told  Agence 
 France  Presse  that  "at  this  stage.  It  is  difficult  to  predict 
 the  outcome  of  the  war  began  adorn  many  surprises,  it  will 
 come  as  a  whole  war  victory  and  defeat.  Or  rather,  half 
 of  the  defeat  of  the  victory  and  a  half  years."  He  added 
 that  it  is  expected  to  reach  the  United  States  military 
 victory  and  Fall  Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein's  regime, 
 however,  because  it  will  most  probably  will  not  be  complete 
 devastation,  coupled  with  a  very  large  number  of  deaths, 
 particularly  of  civilians.  "  At  the  same  time,  "Iraq's  defeat 
 by  expectations,  but  the  Iraqi  resistance  is  continuity  confirm 
 that  the  regime  (Iraqi)  even  though  it  was  defeated  motive 
 and  no  people  on  the  night  of  overnight."  He  pointed  out 
 that  "people's  memory  include  Arab  history  make  stronger  champion 
 faced  with  the  army  on  earth."  In  response  to  a  question 
 on  observed  by  surprise  at  the  beginning  of  the  war  being 
 waged  by  the  United  States  and  Britain  on  Iraq  since  20 
 March  1995,  Abdel-Khaliq  said  "this  war  from  the  recent  wars 
 gather  beginning  surprises  perhaps  most  notably  with  regard 
 to  the  planning."  He  also  said  that  "the  beginning  of  the 
 war  has  shown  that  the  American  reading  of  the  political 
 realities  in  Iraq  are  wrong,"  referring  to  the  expectations 
 which  accompanied  by  launching  the  war,  which  spoke  of  the 
 reception  of  American  forces  receive  "liberators"  in  Iraq 
 and  not  fierce  resistance.  He  added  that  the  United  States 
 was  forced  to  reconsider  its  plans  ",  noting  that  two  weeks 
 after  the  war  has  not  been  able  to  American  and  British 
 forces  from  entering  the  Basra  These  forces  have  emerged 
 in  the  form  of  "give  the  army  came  to  kill  a  civilian 
 freedom.  But  after  killing  massacre  ".  On  the  other  hand, 
 Dr.  Mustafa  felt  distressed  in  security  affairs  and  defence 
 counsel  that  the  British  Royal  Institute  "to  mobilize  the 
 huge  expenditure  huge  numbers  indicate  that  the  purpose  of 
 the  American  war  is  far  from  Iraq."  He  said  in  a  lecture 
 he  delivered  at  the  centre  of  Sheikh  Zayed  Coordination  and 
 Follow-up  to  the  success  of  America  politically  and  militarily 
 in  the  medium  and  long  term  in  Iraq  will  not  be  limited 
 geographically  "and"  waged  war  against  other  states  in  the 
 later  stages  which  will  enable  them  to  restructure  the  balance 
 of  power  in  the  region.  In  this  context,  he  added  that 
 "American  warnings  to  Syria  and  Iran  have  reflected  the  confusion 
 and  anxiety  because  if  America  is  victorious  in  the  first 
 days  of  the  ongoing  war  in  Iraq  and  the  strategy  of  the 
 decree  is  needed  to  warn  both  Syria  and  Iran."  Having  said 
 that  the  war,  which  is  aimed  at  controlling  the  pro-Iraq 
 and  the  establishment  of  political  power  of  the  United  States 
 there  was  "distressed  considered  that  the  American  control 
 on  Iraq"  will  lead  to  a  weakening  of  Syria  and  the  loss 
 of  strategic  depth,  where  Israel  will  become  more  beneficiaries 
 (.  )  and  strengthen  this  situation,  the  Israeli  side  in 
 the  negotiations  with  the  Arabs,  who  will  become  more  willing 
 to  provide  significant  political  concessions.  "  He  also  noted 
 that  Iraq  is  a  geographical  point  closer  to  provide  Israel 
 with  oil,  "referring  to  the"  dream  of  Israel  in  the  rehabilitation 
 of  the  oil  pipeline  linking  the  Mosul  Haifa.  "  Hassan  /

 By  Claire  Jerusalem  4-2  (AFP)  -  threaten  severe  austerity 
 plan  by  Finance  Minister,  Benjamin  Netanyahu  to  remove  Israel 
 from  the  worst  period  of  economic  contraction  in  its  history, 
 causing  social  crisis  since  the  strike  now  comprises  suffocating, 
 so  far,  a  large  number  of  sectors.  The  Central  Trade  Unions 
 (Histadrut)  that  it  is  ready  to  fight,  with  all  that  had 
 the  force,  "special  measures  imposed  by  the  emergency  period" 
 announced  by  Netanyahu,  which  will  affect  mainly  on  the  most 
 disadvantaged  classes.  One  hundred  thousand  strikes,  which 
 responds  to  him  my  officer  almost  fifty  thousand  in  the 
 public  sector  entered  third  day.  Waste  and  accumulate  throughout 
 the  country,  except  in  some  sectors  of  three  major  cities: 
 Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv  and  Haifa,  where  an  order  was  issued 
 by  the  Palestinians  gathered  for  reasons  of  security  for 
 fear  of  in-bombs.  Worse  still  on  the  road.  If  negotiations 
 between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  failed  to  turn  the  role 
 of  the  electricity  company,  water  and  telephone  company  and 
 the  national  airline  "aal"  In  the  declaration  on  the  strike. 
 Did  not  lead  the  talks  between  the  Central  Trade  Union  Chairman 
 Amir  Peretz  Benjamin  Netanyahu  to  nothing  so  far.  Peretz 
 stressed  "the  Histadrut  would  stand  for  a  tough  battle  without 
 concessions  for  the  abolition  of  the  plan  does  not  intend 
 to  never  losing  the  battle."  The  association  also  suggested 
 that  central  alternative  plan,  which  is  based  on  borrowing 
 by  offering  bonds.  The  liberal  minister  reply  as  follows: 
 "If  you  as  you  live  on  another  planet.  The  budget  deficit 
 to  reach  the  pace  of  horror  have  grown  at  a  value  of  50 
 million  shekels  per  day.  Ultimately,  we  will  get  to  the 
 full  bankruptcy  would  then  arrested  one  of  his  salary."  The 
 plan  adopted  by  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the  government 
 at  the  end  of  March,  provides  for  the  new  budget  cuts  worth 
 2.3  billion  dollars,  reducing  the  salaries  of  public  service 
 at  a  rate  ranging  between  8  to  10%  and  the  demobilization 
 of  some  10,000  staff,  including  six  thousand  teachers.  It 
 cuts  social  assistance,  especially  in  the  ad  hoc  family  housing 
 and  compensation.  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  pointed 
 out  that  "the  plan  and  painful"  but  "necessary"  to  face 
 the  most  serious  crisis  in  the  history  of  Israel  after  30 
 months  of  the  Palestinian  intifada.  The  budget  deficit  amounted 
 to  6.4  billion  dollars,  or  6%  of  the  total  gross  domestic 
 product  (GDP).  In  January  is  10.5%  of  the  population  are 
 unemployed  and  the  decline  in  the  gross  domestic  product 
 by  1%  in  the  year  2001  and  0.9%  in  2002  and  will  remain 
 in  the  country's  recession  also  in  the  year  2003.  The  intifada 
 has  been  charged  with  the  Jewish  state  so  dearly.  They  have 
 caused  a  significant  decline  in  tourism  revenue  and  exports 
 in  the  direction  of  Israeli-Palestinian  land  and  created  "an 
 atmosphere  of  uncertainty"  responsible  for  the  decline  in 
 the  movement  of  domestic  consumption  and  a  decline  in  the 
 year  in  the  value  of  investments.  Israel  also  affected  by 
 high-tech  crisis  affecting  the  entire  world.  The  plan  will 
 be  approved  by  parliament  on  first  reading  at  the  end  of 
 the  discussions  expected  on  14  and  15  April  and  is  expected 
 to  hold  meetings  to  vote  in  second  and  third  readings  in

 editor  of  Al-Mussawar  weekly  that  the  civilian  victims  "constitute 
 a  sea  of  blood  separates  the  Iraqi  people's  liberation  forces

 "  The  newspaper  "the  statement  said  that  the"  new  approach

 Michel  Moto  registry  New  York  8-4  (AFP)  -  a  prospect  of 
 a  street  to  street  battles  and  house  to  house  within  the 
 Iraqi  capital,  which  have  become  entrenched  defend  fighters 
 Castle,  a  potential  nightmare  for  some  analysts  believed  that 
 the  American  army  will  do  everything  possible  to  avoid.  In 
 the  face  of  opposition  to  a  significant  portion  of  the  world 
 public  opinion  in  the  absence  of  an  international  umbrella 
 of  the  United  Nations,  could  not  be  the  adoption  of  the 
 American  army  in  Chechnya,  Russian  tactic  around  the  capital, 
 Grozny  debris  to  be  able  to  control.  He  pointed  out  John 
 Feris  military  history  professor  at  the  University  of  Calgary 
 (Canada)  "is  not  easy  to  win  the  battle  for  the  streets 
 without  destroying  the  streets,  the  army  and  the  American 
 knows  so  well."  He  added:  "The  latest  American  army  wants 
 to  do  is  attempting  to  enter  Baghdad  if  it  is  thought  to 
 be  confronted  with  considerable  resistance.  We  will  not  resort 
 to  only  as  a  last  resort  ".  In  a  document  entitled  "doctrine 
 of  operations  in  the  cities,  released  in  September,  the  American 
 Army  General  Staff  of  the  sentence  quoted  Sun  Zu  famous 
 Chinese  military,  which  says  that"  the  worst  tactic  is  protected 
 by  the  walls  of  the  besieged  cities  ".  John  Feris  said 
 that  the  question  will  be  essential  to  be  put  to  the  forces 
 loyal  to  President  Saddam  Hussein  when  the  Americans  launch 
 an  attack  ?  "he  went  on  to  say:"  That  was  still  in  a 
 position  to  rely  on  the  equivalent  of  three  or  four  teams 
 from  the  Republican  Guard,  as  well  as  civilian  forces,  I 
 exclude  the  possibility  that  the  Americans  will  be  able  to 
 avoid  civilian  casualties  and  severe  damage.  "  Most  of  the 
 current  clashes  against  American  and  British  forces  in  southern 
 Iraq  carried  out  mainly  in  the  present  environment  elements 
 of  militias  or  irregular  armed  groups,  which  could  indicate 
 that  the  system  would  be  better  equipped  and  reserve  forces 
 to  defend  the  capital.  For  his  part,  former  officer  researcher 
 in  view  of  religion  Brookings  Institute  that  "we  should  expect 
 to  keep  Saddam  Hussein  himself  more  men  to  meet  him,  this 
 poses  a  problem,  which  brings  us  back  directly  to  the  fundamental 
 question  on  the  extent  of  the  killing  and  destruction,  which 
 should  be  landing  before  the  collapse  of  order.  He  said 
 that  the  resistance  of  the  city  of  Basra  in  southern  Iraq, 
 where  the  majority  of  the  Shiite  could  serve  as  an  indicator 
 next  battle  of  Baghdad.  He  pointed  out  that  "the  British 
 are  trying  to  apply  in  Basra  tactical  means  adopted  in  Belfast." 
 He  added  that  "if  all  goes  well,  it  seems  during  the  scenes 
 on  television  that  this  is  the  case,  we  will  believe  that 
 this  technique  to  be  applicable  in  Baghdad.  In  the  face 
 of  the  difficulties  faced  by  the  coalition  forces  in  cities 
 in  southern  and  central  parts  of  the  country,  in  the  absence 
 of  any  signs  of  communities  to  differences  in  the  Iraqi 
 leadership  or  military,  the  authorities  began  warning  American 
 public  opinion  from  the  control  of  the  Iraqi  capital,  will 
 be  difficult.  He  acknowledged  the  American  Defense  Secretary 
 Donald  Rumsfeld  on  Sunday  that  Baghdad  is  the  heart  of  the 
 system,  the  place  where  the  converging  defenders,  and  it 
 will  not  be  easy  to  control  ".  He  acknowledged  indirectly 
 that  Baghdad  battle,  if  they  occur,  would  begin  soon,  "he 
 added,  pointing  out  that  the  coalition  forces  will  be  launched 
 only  after  four  weeks  of  air  campaign."  He  said  the  president 
 of  the  magazine  editor  Clifford  bill  specialized  British  weekly 
 the  importance  of  the  timetable  and  weather  conditions,  at 
 a  time  temperatures  began  to  rise  in  the  Iraqi  desert.  He 
 said,  "Alliance  soldiers  fighting  at  present,  many  of  the 
 guard,  but  in  the  event  of  battles  in  cities,  it  would 
 be  difficult  to  continue  war  clean."  He  pointed  out  that 
 the  fighting  in  more  cities  and  mobilize  a  greater  number 
 of  men.  This  is  the  battle  should  be  fought  in  conflict 
 with  time.  Whenever  pitched,  it  is  difficult  to  increase 
 the  massacres  in  which  the  Bush  administration  to  continue.
