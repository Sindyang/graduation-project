(1) Primary System Description

The system uses a single nearest neighbor approach to determine
whether a story is sufficiently similar to any previously seen 
story. The belief in novelty of the story was taken to be the 
average similarity with past stories minus similarity of the story to its closest neighbor in the past.

Cosine correlation (length-normalized inner product of 
story vectors) was used as a similarity metric. Both story vectors
were weighted according the the following scheme:

     TF = log (1 + tf)

     IDF = log ((N / DF) 0.5)

where tf is the number of times a given word occurs in a document,
DL is the document length (total number of word occurrences), 
avgDL is the average document length in the collection, DF
is the number of documents in the collection that contain one
or more occurrences of the word, and N is the total number of 
documents in the collection. 

All collection-wide statistics are incremental: we start with an 
empty collection and update statistics as the stories arrive.
Incoming stories were lowercased and reduced to a root form by
a dictionary-based stemmer [2]. Stop-words were removed.

The current story was compared with all the stories preceeding it.

(3) Differences for each Contrastive Run

    No contrastive runs performed.


(4) New Conditions for this Evaluation

    The same system settings used were:

                model      = single link (set to knn 1)
                similarity = cosine
                weighting  = tf*idf
                threshold  = -0.20
                deferral   = 1
