TDT New Event Detection Task

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
Captures co-occurrence counts between location entities and 
non-location words in a sliding window.  Uses the Dice coefficient
to generate an association value for the pair.  Significant pairs 
are added as a feature to the story's vector representation and 
constituent words in the pair are removed from the vector.  The 
pair's weight is the sum of its member's tf.idf weights.  Uses 
pairwise full-text cosine similarity.

<PARAM name="threshold" value="0.19" />
<PARAM name="boost" value="1.0" />
<PARAM name="critical_value" value="0.7" />
<PARAM name="min_freq" value="5" />
<PARAM name="file_lookahead" value="10" />
<PARAM name="file_lookbehind" value="20" />

2) TRAINING:
The global idf counts are computed from stories sampled from the
tdt3 corpus.  Rethresholded to 0.7964 based on harmonic mean of 
tdt3 and tdt4 optimal thresholds.

3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST:
None.

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:
None.
