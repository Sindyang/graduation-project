shai/majority
TDT New Event Detection Task (Official submission)

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
Combines the following NED methods in a committee of three members.  A majority
voting scheme is used whereby the voting majority (FS, non-FS) determines the
final judgment.  The associated confidence is the average normalized distance 
from the judgment threshold for the models in the majority.  
   + Baseline - Uses tf-idf weighting with pairwise full-text cosine similarity.
   + LocationAssoc - Captures co-occurrence counts between location entities 
     and non-location words in a sliding window.  Uses the Dice coefficient 
     to generate an association value for the pair.  Significant pairs are 
     added as a feature to the story's vector representation and constituent
     words in the pair are removed from the vector.  The pair's weight is the
     sum of its member's tf.idf weights.  Uses pairwise full-text cosine 
     similarity.
   + SentenceLink - Presence of a sentence in one story that matches the text 
     of another story implies a link.  Matching is done by binary feature 
     overlap between the sentence and the story.  Pairwise sentence/story 
     matching is performed.

2) TRAINING:
The global idf counts are computed from stories sampled from the
tdt3 corpus.

Baseline threshold = 0.8092
LocationAssoc = 0.7964
SentenceLink = 0.5858

3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST:
None.

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:
None.

5) REFERENCES:
None.
