TDT New Event Detection Task

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
Combines the following NED methods:
a) Uses tf-idf weighting with pairwise full-text cosine similarity.
b) Presence of a sentence in one story that matches the text of another
story implies a link.  Matching is done by binary feature overlap
between the sentence and the story.  Pairwise sentence/story matching
is performed.

Classifiers are combined in a linear pipeline.  If (a) judges a story
to be non-FS, that judgment is kept.  If it judges a story to be FS,
(b) is consulted and its judgment used instead.  The intent is to allow
(b) to fix a class of errors made by (a) by recognizing linking events
that relate a story from a new activity of a topic to stories from
previous activities.

2) TRAINING:
(a) was thresholded to 0.8092 and (b) to 0.3900 based on the harmonic
mean of optimized values from tdt3 and tdt4 newswire datasets prior
to pipelined combination.

3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST:
None.

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:
None.

5) REFERENCES:
None.
