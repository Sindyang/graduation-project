CMU/CMUDIR
TDT supervised topic tracking task
1) The system is the YFilter adaptive filterng system developed in CMU Distributed Information Retrieval group. The system was orignally designed for TREC adaptive filtering tack. We only changed the input/out file format processing part of the system for the TDT task. We also disabled using original user profile module (which is valid for TREC). No parameters were tuned for TDT task in this run.
2) Training: Nt=1, U=10R-NR
3) Differences for each contrastive test:
	Changing of Nt
	Changing of the negative training data weight
