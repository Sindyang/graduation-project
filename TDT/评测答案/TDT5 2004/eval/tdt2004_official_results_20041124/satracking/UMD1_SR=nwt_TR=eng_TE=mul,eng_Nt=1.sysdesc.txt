Topic Tracking
1) Primary Test System Description:
	This system is based on n-gram language modeling. The n-gram term is defined as a contiguous n-chars in the text source. 
2) Training:
	The system is trained with both given on-topic stories and a sampled "assumed" off-topic stories. The off-topic stories are sampled from a time period starting from the corpus starting date to a percentage period before the first on-topic story. Then a smaller set of stories are chosen from that sample according to similarity to the on-topic stories. The top most similar stories are assumed to be "off-topic".
	In the adaptive task, if a retrieved decoument was relevant, it's added to the on-topic training set, and if it was irrelevant, it replaces one of the previously assumed off-topic stories. Log-odds are then recomputed before a new document is considered.
3) Differences For each Contrastive Test:
	No differences are considered.
4) New Conditions For The Evaluation:
	No new conditions.
5) References:
