TDT5 tracking with manually-segmented story boundaries

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

   The Rocchio algorithm generates relevance scores for a given document
   and class (event) by comparing centroid computed from positive 
   and negative centroid (according to the standard cosine similiarity metric) 
   Because of system efficiency, we used most similar kn negative documents for
   the negative centroid compared to the positive centroid.

2) TRAINING
   Nt = 1
   term-weighting scheme: TFxIDF with cosine-normalization, where 
      TF(x)= 1 + ln(# of times term x occurs in document) 
      IDF(x) = ln((# of documents in corpus seen so far)/
                    (# of documents term x appears in))
   alpha = 1
   beta  = -3.0 
   kn = 8000

   Threshold is constant tuned on TDT3 DR Corpus


3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:
   This run is optimized for T11SU.
