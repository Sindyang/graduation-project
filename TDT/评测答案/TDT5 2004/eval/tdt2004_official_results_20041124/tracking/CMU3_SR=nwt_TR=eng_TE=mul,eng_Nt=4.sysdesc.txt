CMU/kNN-score
TDT3 tracking with manually-segmented story boundaries

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

   The kNN-score algorithm generates relevance scores for a given document
   and class (event) by retrieving the kp most-similar (according to the
   standard cosine similiarity metric) in-class documents and kn most-
   similar out-of-class documents.  The relevance score for the given
   document (designated "d")is then computed as

   (1/kp)*SUM(k=1 to kp):SIM(d,IC(k,c)) - (1/kn)*SUM(l=1 to kn):SIM(d,OC(l,c))

   where "d" is the document for which the relevance score is being
   computed, "c" is the class (e.g. event), SUM(<var>= <a> to <b>):<expr>
   is the sum of the values of <expr> as <var> goes from <a> to <b>,
   IC(k,c) is the kth most-similar in-class document to document "d" for 
   class c, OC(k,c) is the kth most-similar out-of-class document
   for class c, and SIM(a,b) is the standard cosine similarity between
   documents a and b.

2) TRAINING
   Nt = 4
   term-weighting scheme: TFxIDF with cosine-normalization, where 
      TF(x)= 1 + ln(# of times term x occurs in document) 
      IDF(x) = ln((# of documents in corpus seen so far)/
                    (# of documents term x appears in))
   kp = 4
   kn = 2500
   pmax = 500
   rth = 0.25	
   decision threshold = 0.035

3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:
   Separate kp and kn instead of a single k
   No time window
