ict/MulLevelCluster
TDT Hierarchical Topic Detection Task

1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
Using hierarchical agglomerate clustering method first to cluster all the texts into microclusters,
then using singlepass to cluster the microclusters for many levels. In each level,the threshold is 
decreased by a decimal--BC than former level.

Cosine + time decay correlation was used as a similarity metric. 

   D(di,dj) =  cos(di,dj)*(1-i/m)

Both story vectors were weighted using tf*IDF weighting scheme :

     IDF = log (N / DF) / log (N)


2) TRAINING:
using TDT4 corpus for training 

3) DIFFERENCES FOR EACH CONTRASTIVE TEST:
none.

4) NEW CONDITIONS FOR THIS EVALUATION:

m = 280
bucket size = 10000
bottem level threshold : 0.35
BC = 0.07
