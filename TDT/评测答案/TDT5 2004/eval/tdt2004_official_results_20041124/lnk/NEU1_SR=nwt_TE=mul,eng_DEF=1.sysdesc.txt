TDT Task Designation: Topic Tracking (TRK)



(1) Primary System Description

This system relies on a vsm model.
The feature of vector is word cluster. 
Clusters are got from TDT3 corpus and TDT4 corpus.
The similarity of stories is calculated by cosine function[1].  

(2) Training

    Parameters learned on dry run corpus.


(3) Differences for each Contrastive Run

    No contrastive runs performed.

(4) New Conditions for this Evaluation

    The system settings used were:

                model               = vsm
                weighting	    = tf
                threshold	    = 0.5
		score normalization = NO
                def = 1
