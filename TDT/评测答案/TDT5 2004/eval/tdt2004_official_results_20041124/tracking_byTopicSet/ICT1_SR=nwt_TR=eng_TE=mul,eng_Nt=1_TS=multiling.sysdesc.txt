Topic Tracking (TRK)


(1) Primary System Description

Both story vectors were weighted using tf*IDF weighting scheme :

     IDF = log (N / DF) / log (N)

where tf is the number of times a given word occurs in a document,
DF is the number of documents in the collection that contain one
or more occurrences of the word, and N is the total number of 
documents in the collection. 

Cosine + time decay correlation was used as a similarity metric. 

   D(di,dj) =  cos(di,dj)*(1-i/m)

Stop-words and stop-part of speech were removed. NE were weighted.


(2) Training

    using TDT4 corpus for training 


(3) Differences for each Contrastive Run

    No contrastive runs performed.


(4) New Conditions for this Evaluation

    The system settings used were:

                model               = central 
                similarity	    = cosine+time
                weighting	    = tf_idf
                threshold	    = 0.20		
                deferral	    = 1				
                Nt = 1
