TDT Task Designation: Topic Tracking (TRK)



(1) Primary System Description

This system relies on a unigram model[1][2].
The similarity between a story and a topic is the normalized 
log likelihood ratio between the topic model and a general 
Chinese model. The general English model was estimated from 
the TDT3 corpus and TDT4 corpus.  
For each topic, a unigram model is constructed from the provided 
on-topic stories without using the off-topic training stories. 
Due to the sparseness of the on-topic training data, 
the probability of the story given the topic is obtained 
by interpolating its maximum likelihood unigram estimate 
with the general Chinese model probability. 
The interpolation coefficient ¦Ë was chosen to minimize the 
tracking cost on the part of topics. 

(2) Training

    Parameters learned on dry run corpus.


(3) Differences for each Contrastive Run

    No contrastive runs performed.

(4) New Conditions for this Evaluation

    The system settings used were:

                model               = unigram
                weighting	    = tf
                threshold	    = 4.45
		score normalization = NO
                ¦Ë =0.25
                Nt = 1
                Nn = 0
