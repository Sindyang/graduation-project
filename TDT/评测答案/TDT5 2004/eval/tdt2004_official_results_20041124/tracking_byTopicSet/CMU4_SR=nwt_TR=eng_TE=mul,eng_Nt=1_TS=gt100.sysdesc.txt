1) PRIMARY TEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

COSINE is an old tracker using simple cosine similarity between the
positive training instances and the new story being tracked.  If
multiple positive training instances are available, the decision is
based on the second-highest similarity score.  If the decision would
be YES and there are negative training instances, the provisional
decision can be vetoed by the negative training instances if the new
story is more similar to a negative instance than to any positive
instance.

Adaptation consists of adding the new story to either the set of
positive training instances or the set of negative training instances,
as appropriate.  The number of additions to the training sets is
bounded to keep down the computational cost and to avoid indefinite
expansion of the YES decisions or excessive vetos (for TDT4nwt, the
optimum proved to be 18 positive and 18 negative; for TDT5, with its
lack of complete annotation, the negative limit needs to be lower and
was set to 2).
