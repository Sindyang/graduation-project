55001.  Family demands body be moved 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Family of James Davis, James Davis, Othniel Askew
WHAT: Family of James Davis, demand movement of body. 
WHEN: 08/01/2003
WHERE: Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York City, New York

Topic Explication
In a strange twist of fate, City Councilman James Davis and his killer, Othniel Askew were interred in the same cemetery. The mix-up occurred because Askew's funeral arrangements were made by his brother under a different name. The Davis family has a plot in the Cemetery of the Evergreens, but accepted the offer of a free plot at Green-Wood Cemetery because it's the resting place of some of New York's most famous and infamous people. At the request of Davis' mother, Thelma Davis, the mayor expedited Davis' exhumation and re-burial at Cemetery of the Evergreens. 
Background
Othniel Askew was a model citizen and had been arrested for abusing his homosexual lover on one occasion. He hoped to run against James Davis for his city council seat in the fall, but failed to file the correct paperwork on time. Davis invited Askew to join him on the city council floor, where the shooting took place. Davis was a former police officer and had founded a social awareness organization called, Love Yourself and Stop the Violence. 
Green-Wood Cemetery is a 27 mile stretch of Brooklyn, several blocks east of Prospect Park. All told, the cemetery holds over 600,000 graves, ranging from governors to ball players, chief justices to gangsters. Nathaniel Currier, James Ives, F.A.O. Schwarz, Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Ebbets, and the notorious William "Boss" Tweed all rest there.

55004.  Whales Stranded in Florida 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Pilot whales
WHAT: Stranded themselves.
WHEN: 04/18/2003
WHERE: Florida Keys

Topic Explication
Dozens of pilot whales (approximately 27-31+) beached themselves in the shallow waters off Big Pine Key, one of the string of islands at Florida Keys. Seven, including two that were euthanized, died when first discovered by a fisherman. Six were able to swim freely into the Gulf of Mexico and 3-9 were unaccounted for. Their reasons for beaching is unknown. Seven whales including a 12-foot male and a 1-year-old female calf were rescued, loaded into a boat by crane, and taken to the pen for rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, two died. The surviving five whales have been taken care of by teams of volunteers and released after four months. 
Background
Massive strandings or beaching by pilot whales are not unusual and have been recorded for centuries. In July 2002, more than 40 pilot whales repeatedly beached themselves on the coast of Massachusetts. 
Pilot whales are social and communicate with whistles and clicks. They generally feed and travel in groups, or 'pods', of 5-50. Marine experts have not been able to explain why marine mammals such as whales or dolphins get stranded in shallow waters. Some theories include illness, navigational disorientation due to certain geographical or loud man-made noise that confuse their sonar system, or empathy of other whales into the shallow waters.

WHO: Ted Nugent
WHAT: Ted Nugent sues for being called a racist.
WHEN: 08/23/2003
WHERE: Muskegon, CO

Topic Explication
Ted Nugent filed a lawsuit in federal court naming the City of Muskegon, Mayor Stephen Warmington, City Manager Bryon Mazade, and Meridian Entertainment. In the suit, Nugent claims accusations from city officials and the cancellation of his June 30th concert damaged his reputation and career. Officials for the Muskegon Summer Celebration cancelled the show after Nugent did an interview with Rick Lewis and Michael Floorwax, in which the two Denver disc jockeys said he made racist comments referring to Asians and blacks. Nugent contends that the statements were falsely attributed and run counter to his beliefs. 
Background
On the radio show, Nugent apparently uttered derogatory terms for Asians and blacks trying to make the point that they were just words and shouldn't offend, citing Richard Pryor's language use as an example. The show's producer did not believe the comments to be racist but after a flood of calls, complaining about the interview, both deejays publicly denounced his use of the words.

55012.  National Do Not Call Registry 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Congress; telemarketers; FTC; FCC; Lee West; Edward Nottingham
WHAT: Passed legislation to protect citizens from unsolicited telemarketer phone calls.
WHEN: 09/25/2003
WHERE: Washington DC

Topic Explication
Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation to protect citizens from unsolicited telemarketer phone calls. The "do-not-call" list applies to telemarketers only, not to nonprofit organizations, politicians, and pollsters. U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham has slightly slowed the implementation by ruling that the do-not-call legislation impedes upon telemarketers' Constitutionally protected right to free speech. 
Background
In late June, the "do not call" list program began. Subsequent legal activity placed the program's legal status in doubt: on September 23, federal district judge in Oklahoma, Lee West, ruled that the FTC lacked authorization from Congress to establish the no-call registry. Congress responded rapidly, overwhelmingly passing new legislation (which was then signed by President Bush) explicitly granting the FTC the necessary authority to maintain and enforce the list. 
But on the same day (9/25), U.S. District Judge in Colorado, Edward Nottingham, blocked the list based on telemarketers' free speech rights as guaranteed by the Constitution's first amendment. Because this ruling is rooted in the Constitution, while a higher court may overrule it, Congress cannot override it with a mere statute. When a constitutional ruling and a regulation or statute clash, the constitutional ruling prevails.

WHAT: Memorial service for Lonnie Donegan.
WHEN: Thursday, 05/08/2003
WHERE: St. Paul's church, Covent Garden, London, UK

Topic Explication
The "king of skiffle," Lonnie Donegan, died during a concert tour in November 2002 and now a public service is being held to commemorate England's first musical super-star. Queen's Brian May, the Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood, Van Morrison, and Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler were among the musicians present to pay tribute to one of the pioneers of rock in England. His "skiffle" music has been described as a mixture of folk, jazz, gospel and the blues. Whatever it was, skiffle made music accessible to Britons in a way that it hadn't been before and influenced a generation. The ceremony was held in St Paul's church in Covent Garden, London. 
Background
Skiffle Music is a type of folk music with a jazz and blues influence, usually using homemade or improvised instruments such as the washboard, tea-chest bass, kazoo, cigar-box fiddle, or a comb and paper, and so forth. Skiffle first became popular in the early 1900s in the US, starting in New Orleans. Its roots are also found in the jazz bands of the 1940s and 1950s. Skiffle became extremely popular in the UK in the late 1950s, when Lonnie Donegan enjoyed major international success with the Leadbelly song, "Rock Island Line" and the novelty song "Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Over Night?" 
Other well-known British skiffle groups include The Gin Mill Skiffle Group, and The Quarry Men, who later became the rock band The Beatles. Mick Jagger was a member of the Barber-Colyer Skiffle Band but claims he didn't really like skiffle. Nonetheless, it was the popularity of simple skiffle music that opened young Britons' eyes to the idea that they could play music and have hit records. The result, several years later, was the musical explosion called the British Invasion.

Seminal Event 


WHO: poachers
WHAT: Ugandan poachers charged for killing elephants.
WHEN: 07/03/2003
WHERE: Uganda

Topic Explication
In March of 2003, seven elephants were killed by poachers in Murchison Falls National Park. Six suspected poachers have been charged in a military court in Uganda for killing these protected animals and taking off with their tusks. This incident represents the largest number of elephants killed by poachers in Uganda in the past twenty years. 
Background
Although the international trade in ivory was banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1989, the illegal ivory trade and elephant poaching are alive and well.
Poaching is the act of hunting for animals illegally. In the case of animals that produce a highly prized commodity, such as elephants (ivory), poaching can pose a serious threat of extinction. As a result of poaching, Uganda's elephant population has fallen to 3000 from 30,000 since the 1960s.

WHAT: Jeffrey John is appointed as Bishop of Reading, England.
WHEN: 05/20/2003
WHERE: Reading, England

Topic Explication
On May 20th, the Church of England announced that they had appointed a new Bishop of Reading, a 51-year-old Jeffrey John. John was well-known for his reform efforts, his passionate evangelism, and his 20-year loving relationship with another man. His appointment as Bishop of Reading was confirmed by the Queen, still the nominal head of the Church of England. He had come under fire for denouncing the church's ban on homosexual marriages, and for 4 years had been open about his now celibate relationship with his partner. 
Background
The Rev d. Canon Jeffrey Philip Hywel John was appointed in late May. The controversy was immediate and heated. But, interestingly, it was not centered on his homosexuality or his continuing, unrepentant celibate relationship with his partner of twenty years. The initial fervor was over his opinion on gay marriage, which he supported despite the Church of England's firm stance on the matter. Despite his assertion that he would abide by all of the codes and laws of the Church, other high-ranking clergy contested his appointment by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. 
This brought his appointment under international scrutiny. International reaction to John's homosexuality was mixed. Many saw the appointment as a promising sign of benevolence and acceptance. But others were shocked and hostile, particularly the Archbishop of Nigeria, who threatened to break from the Church of England over the matter. Instead of being a sign of peace, the appointment of Britain's first gay bishop was becoming a bone of contention. Under threats of schism, Archbishop Rowan Williams reluctantly asked John to step down, months before he was supposed to take office. John complied.

Topic Explication
On Sept. 4, distraught father, William Hoffine, ended the life of his son, Evan Nash, with a volley of gunfire on the sidewalk in front of People's Market in Ocean Beach. Nash, a freshman at Point Loma High School, was felled as he ran past the popular health food market on Voltaire with his cross-country team. After killing his son, Hoffine drove to a friend's townhouse in OB, where he cloistered himself inside an encirclement of swat teams and made a number of phone calls on his cell phone until approximately 1:30 a.m. when he ended his own life with a single shot to his head. 
Background

Seminal Event 


WHO: Sylvio Berlusconi, Italian Parliament
WHAT: Italian parliament passed the bill under pressure from Italy's Prime Minister and current richest man, Sylvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi, terrified of spiders and other crawlies, pushed the parliament into outlawing all poisonous arachnids. The new bill was introduced and passed with a speed that shocked the opposition.
WHEN: 07/29/2003
WHERE: Rome, Italy

Topic Explication
Under pressure from Prime Minister and Italy's richest man Sylvio Berlusconi, the Italian Senate passed into law a bill forbidding the import of scorpions, tarantulas, and eight-legged venomous creatures. 
Background
The Senate had for months been deadlocked by an investigation of PM Berlusconi's sometimes-shady business deals, but somehow they found the time to assuage his fears of arachnid attack. They passed a bill banning the import or sale of arachnids, which Berlusconi is reputedly terrified of. The bill was drafted by Berlusconi's own office and presented to the Senate in the form of a decree, a form usually reserved for the most urgent of executive matters. It was passed into law with blazing speed. The whole affair, from introduction to adoption as law, took less than a month, and this from the notoriously slow Italian Parliament.
Berlusconi doesn't like creepie-crawlies. In 1996, he underwent plastic surgery for damage caused by what he claimed was a spider bite. And then the final straw: a pharmaceutical company imported more than 300 scorpions just a few months before the new law was passed. The company's lab is located a few miles from one of Berlusconi's private residences outside Milan. Berlusconi reportedly expressed concern that the security at the lab might not be adequate for the containment of the venomous creatures and that they might make their way into his garden. So he took steps.
The Prime Minister's office said, concerning the new law, that Berlusconi was an "animal lover who wanted to protect Italians from potential danger."

55023.  Milwaukee Bucks face assault charges 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Gary Payton, Sam Cassell, Jason Caffey
WHAT: The three players surrendered to Toronto police and face assault charges.
WHEN: 04/19/2003
WHERE: Toronto, Canada

Topic Explication
Gary Payton, Sam Cassell and Jason Caffey of the Milwaukee Bucks all surrendered to Toronto police following an investigation into an alleged assault outside a local strip club. Payton, 35, is charged with three counts of assault while Cassell, 33, is charged with two counts of assault. Caffey, 29, faces one count of assault. The three players were all released and are scheduled to appear at Toronto court May 30. The alleged assaults occurred around 2:30 a.m. last Friday after the players left a taxi in front of the club where a dancer was arguing with her boyfriend, authorities said. The Bucks arrived in Toronto last Thursday for a game Friday night against the Raptors. Mullin said earlier the "members of the Milwaukee team exited the cab to confront the man and there was a physical confrontation. The doorman attempted to intervene and he was assaulted as well." The dancer claimed she was assaulted when she tried to separate her boyfriend from the players, who had spent part of the evening at the club. The boyfriend had some minor bumps and scrapes, but the woman and the doorman had no visible injuries, Mullin said. 
Background
Police have upgraded an assault charge against former Milwaukee Bucks teammates Gary Payton, Sam Cassell and Jason Caffey stemming from a fight, a prosecutor and the men's lawyer said Friday. Payton, Cassell and Caffey are charged in connection with an altercation outside a bar April 11. They were charged with common assault, but police upgraded it to assault causing bodily harm, prosecutor Calvin Barry said. Barry said further investigation found that one of the participants in the altercation was injured.
Payton is now with the Los Angeles Lakers and Cassell with the Minnesota Timberwolves. They are accused of assaulting two men and two women outside a club after closing time while the Bucks were in Toronto to play the Raptors.
According to Edward Greenspan, the players' lawyer, prosecutors have indicated they will proceed with summary charges in the case, rather than more serious indictable charges. "One of the people who made the allegation of assault at the time said that he suffered no injuries, but has now got some medical evidence that we have not seen that he did suffer some medical injury," Greenspan said, adding he believed the injury was whiplash. "There's no suggestion of serious bodily harm."
He noted that police file charges in Canada that prosecutors later review, a different system than in the United States, where prosecutors file charges as a legal decision. "The reality is that what happened today is what the police did all on their own, which the prosecutor several months down the road will review," Greenspan said. The maximum sentences for summary charges are 18 months for assault causing bodily harm and six months for common assault, Greenspan said. Under the revised charges, Payton now faces two counts of common assault and one count of assault causing bodily harm, while Cassell faces one of each and Caffey a lone count of assault causing bodily harm.

55026.  Inmates escape French prison by helicopter 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Three French inmates
WHAT: Three French inmates escape from prison with assistance from helicopter.
WHEN: 04/14/2003
WHERE: Luynes, France

Topic Explication
Three prisoners accused of running an international drug smuggling ring staged a daring daylight escape by helicopter from a jail in southern France, officials and police sources said. No shots were fired and no one was hurt during the escape, an official at the UFAP prison guards' union told Reuters. Franck Perletto, Michel Valero and Eric Alboreo had been due to go on trial in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille next month on charges of running a network trafficking drugs between Morocco, Brazil and France, police sources said. The three prisoners escaped after two accomplices hijacked a helicopter and ordered the pilot to hover above the prison courtyard. One of the men abseiled from the helicopter to cut through a security net and allow the inmates, who were on an exercise break outside, to climb aboard. The whole operation lasted less than two minutes. The prison break follows a similar helicopter escape by two inmates at the same prison in 2001. 
Background
The breakout at Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence was the latest in a series of escapes from French prisons, which have prompted Justice Minister Dominique Perben to order swifter rotation between jails of the country's most dangerous convicts. The prison break follows a similar helicopter escape by two inmates at the same prison in 2001. The Justice Ministry has begun a program of prison reform including large-scale searches of high-security prisons for materials which could be used in future escapes. But prison guards have criticized the government for what they say is a failure to tackle the problem of overcrowding in prisons. The prison population in France is at a record high level with nearly 60,000 people in jail - one in every thousand people. "It is time for the government to take urgent measures for French prisons and the staff who work in them to improve security," said Frederic Grandcolas, secretary general of the prison guards' union.

55027.  Thai prison to stage laughter contest 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Thailand's Corrections Department
WHAT: Thai prison holds a laughter contest for convicts.
WHEN: 04/29/2003
WHERE: Thailand

Topic Explication
Thailand's prison Corrections Department will hold a laughter contest in an attempt to ease stress in the nation's overcrowded prisons. The inmate whose laugh is deemed "most contagious" will be awarded with a prize trophy. There will also be a joke-telling competition. These programs, in addition to meditation, choir singing, cooking lessons, and soccer tournaments, are part of a larger effort to reduce the stress levels in the prison population, which is 150,000 inmates over its 100,000 capacity. 
Background
Prison populations have increased dramatically in recent years in Thailand. While the number of inmates in 1996 was 102,950 and the imprisonment rate an already high 173.1 per one hundred, by 2000 these numbers had increased to a population of 206,011 and an imprisonment rate of 334.1. In 2002, the prison staff to inmate ratio was a whopping 1:23, as compared to 1:8 just ten years earlier.
The reason for the remarkable and rapid increase is usually allotted to the recent increase in Government suppression of drug offenses. "We'd make sure the drug trafficker have only two places to stay - jail or the cemetery," said Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in March of 2003. His tough "war on drugs" has significantly increased the numbers in Thai prisons. It is also believed that sufficient early release measures - such as a Royal Decree of Pardon or parole - are not being utilized fully. This is exacerbated by staff shortages, insufficient budgets, a tendency to overlook alternatives to imprisonment, and a generally inefficient administration.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Anna Lindh
WHAT: Anna Lindh, Swedish Foreign Minister, was stabbed while shopping at an exclusive department store in downtown Stockholm.
WHEN: 09/10/2003
WHERE: Stockholm, Sweden

Topic Explication
Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, age 46, was stabbed just before 4 pm on September 10th while shopping in Nordiska Kompanie, an upscale store in downtown Stockholm. Her attacker was reported as an unidentified Swedish-looking man. Lindh was rushed to Karolinska Hospital. Initially her reported condition was not life-threatening, however overnight her condition worsened and she died early the following morning. Police do not think the attack was politically motivated. 
Background
Sweden has prided itself on a tradition of openness: Lindh regularly commuted alone by public transportation and anyone could walk up and converse or debate with her. Her actions were not atypical of Swedish politicians. Most politicians say this attack will not change their openness, but nonetheless many Swedes still see this as an attack on Sweden's openness and naivete. 
Lindh had been in politics since her early twenties. She had been head of the Foreign Ministry since 1998 and served as environmental minister before that. She was very popular, even tipped to become Prime Minister. Lindh was stabbed during the final days of a campaign in which she had been trying to persuade Swedes to vote in favor of joining the European single currency.

55032.  Cracker Barrel Lawsuit 
Seminal Event 


WHO: 23 plaintiffs
WHAT: Plaintiffs allege that the service they received at Cracker Barrel franchises in Arkansas, Georgia, and other states was inferior to that provided to the white patrons. When they complained, a manager suggested that perhaps Burger King would be more suited to them.
WHEN: 07/30/2003
WHERE: Arkansas

Topic Explication
A class-action lawsuit involving 23 predominantly African American plaintiffs has been filed against the CBRL Group, a Tennessee-based company that owns the 497 Cracker Barrel locations around the country. The suit alleges that the company's stores pursued systematic campaigns of discrimination at many of their Southern locations, but particularly in and around Atlanta, Georgia and Little Rock, Arkansas. The discrimination, they say, was made by the managers of the individual stores with the tacit approval of the company management. 
Background
The CBRL group is a publicly owned and traded firm listed on the NASDAQ that reported earnings totaling 1.9 billion dollars in 2003. Their 497 locations lead the nation's diner business in earnings, with Cracker Barrel far ahead of other chains like Denny's and IHOP. But the success of the chains has come despite multiple incidences of discrimination on the part of the company. In 1991, company policy was rewritten to say that all employees must display the "normal heterosexual values" that are the "foundation of families." Despite a swarm of complaints, the company did not publicly retract this policy until 2002, after a decade of fierce lobbying by one of its largest shareholders.
In 2002, a class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia alleging that the company had repeatedly and systematically discriminated against patrons based on race. The case meandered through the courts for a while, then was struck down by a Georgia judge, who denied the suit class-action status. The CBRL group refused to settle with the plaintiffs or acknowledge their claims. So the next step was a federal discrimination lawsuit. Attorney Phillip Kaplan filed the suit on behalf of 23 predominantly black plaintiffs, some of them held over from the failed Georgia class-action suit. The new suit was filed in Little Rock, Arkansas.
The allegations of the plaintiffs are deeply disturbing. Rev. Henry Harris, an elderly black man, visited a Little Rock Cracker Barrel and waited for seating. His party waited for 40 minutes, while white parties of identical size who arrived after he did were ushered in and seated immediately. Eventually, his party was led into the restaurant and seated at the very back, against their wishes, in the smoking section, where all of the restaurant's other African American customers were seated. Service was poor. When the reverend complained, the manager of the restaurant suggested that, if he was dissatisfied, there was a Burger King around the corner. Harris said that the experience was evocative of the "Jim Crow" discrimination that he had faced more than 40 years before.
Teri Wise, a 34 year-old black woman, said that she experienced discrimination while she was browsing through the "Country Store" portion of a Cracker Barrel establishment. Everywhere she went she was closely shadowed by a white sales-woman. When she picked up a doll to examine, the sales-woman removed it from her hands and returned it to the shelf. Another plaintiff is an older white man, who went to a Cracker Barrel with his adopted black son. They were forced to wait to be seated, and then simply never served.
The Justice Department investigation into Cracker Barrel policies seems to uphold the plaintiffs allegations. They found that Cracker Barrels consistently segregate customers by race, giving better seating to white patrons. Cracker Barrel policies often allowed white servers to refuse to serve black families. Black groups are seated at the rear of many restaurants, where they are served almost exclusively by black servers, while white servers take care of the white patrons seated at the front of the establishment. In all of this, the managers of the restaurants either participated directly or knowingly allowed it to continue. 
A black former waitress at Cracker Barrel alleges that white servers routinely paid her one to three dollars to serve black tables. The manager was aware of, and even encouraged, this practice. The Justice Department found that eighty percent of Cracker Barrel's employees (current employment is around 55,000) had seen or directly experienced discrimination. CBRL group did not dispute these figures, but said that, if that is the case, the responsibility for continued discrimination must be placed on those employees. The company's non-discrimination policy states clearly that every incident of discrimination should be reported to company headquarters. As few reports have been filed, the company cannot be held responsible for continued discrimination.
But it is not that simple. Take the case of Lorraine Nelson, a sixty year-old African American woman who went to a Cracker Barrel with her two grandsons after church one Sunday. They waited for an hour while white patrons were served. She was irate, and immediately filed a complaint with the company headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee. No response came. Further phone calls had no effect. In fact, the formal investigation into the Cracker Barrel claims department found that "the vast majority" of discrimination complaints were ignored.
The Justice Department investigation concluded with 42 pages of recommended changes in company policy. Several of the complainants in the federal case have filed civil suits against CBRL in response to the federal findings, seeking financial damages. The CBRL still maintains that all allegations of racial discrimination are fabrications, as discrimination would run counter to their mission statement of "pleasing people." Each incident can be justified by other, more friendly explanations than discrimination, in the cases where a greedy plaintiff did not simply make the whole thing up. Besides, the company said in the same press release, some 13% of their 55,000 employees are black, as are 7% of their franchise owners, and three of the company's directors, including the Director of Human Services, who is in charge of training policy. After all, if some of their best friends are black, how could they be racist?

WHEN: 07/16/2003
WHERE: Santa Monica, California

Topic Explication
Russel Weller, aged 86, drove his Buick through two blocks of a farmer's market, resulting in ten deaths. 
Background
When Russell Weller was pulled from his car at the end of it all, he did not appear to know what had happened. He exited the car with his cane, unhurt. More than two blocks of carnage lay behind him.
Weller was 86 years old. His neighbors described him as a perfect father, a perfect grandfather, a bastion of his church. He led an active life and had many friends. On July 16th, Weller turned his 1992 maroon Buick LeSabre onto Hollywood Blvd. which was closed for an open-air farmer's market. It is not known what happened next, except that the vehicle accelerated through two blocks of produce and pedestrians. Witnesses say that Weller appeared to be stiff behind the wheel. His neighbors suggested that perhaps he had suffered a mild stroke or heart attack, making him press convulsively on the gas pedal and hold it for two blocks. Weller himself has said that he was trying to stop the car and simply hit the wrong pedal. The vehicle finally came to rest with a man on the hood and a woman under the wheels. The area looked like a war zone. Women were screaming; injured people lay sprawled on the sidewalks; a woman clutched a tiny, limp figure to her breast. More than fifty people were injured, thirteen of them critically. Eight more were dead, including a seven month-old. Two more would die from their injuries within the next week.It is surprising that there was no riot, as there was in a similar case in Chicago in 2002. Then, a mob beat the driver and passenger of a van to death with bricks and stones after they lost control of their van and crashed into a stoop, killing a woman. One witness to the Weller crash said that he calmed the crowd down when they were clamoring to beat Weller up, but there was no confirmation of this. Instead, the crowd stayed to help the wounded until more than a hundred emergency vehicles arrived. The police arrested Weller, but extensive testing showed no evidence of alcohol or medications in his system. He was released after questioning.A few days later, Weller issued a statement describing his deep sorrow for the pain he had caused. No criminal charges have been filed, although it is possible that Weller could be charged with vehicular homicide. Such a charge is unlikely in the absence of malicious intent or intoxicants.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima
WHAT: Ronaldo receives the best returning athelete award.
WHEN: 05/20/2003
WHERE: Monte Carlo

Topic Explication
Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo became the first man to collect two Laureus Statuettes in the same year as the 2003 Laureus World Sports Awards were announced in Monte Carlo on May 20. 2003. First he received the Laureus World Comeback of the Year award following the goals he scored in the 2002 World Cup for which he won the Golden Boot as leading goalscorer. Then, on behalf of World Cup winners Brazil, he picked up a second Statuette for the Laureus World Team of the Year award. Ronaldo, who had flown in from Madrid during the afternoon, received an enthusiastic reception from an audience of sports stars, past and present, and sporting enthusiasts from the world of entertainment. The Awards Ceremony has a worldwide TV audience of 320 million. 
Background
Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima, simply known as Ronaldo, is a Brazilian footballer who is widely considered to be one of the best strikers playing today. He was born on September 22, 1976. In 1993, aged 16, he had already scored 59 goals in 57 matches for Brazil's under 17 squad. By 1994 he joined the squad of the national team but didn't get to play a single minute on the pitch of the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the USA. In 1996/97, Ronaldo played arguably his best season, scoring numerous spectacular goals for FC Barcelona. One of them, a solo goal against Compostela, is considered one of the most amazing goals in football. Chosen the World's best player in 1996 and 1997, he had a disappointing performance during the 1998 World Cup, scoring only 4 goals, and losing the final to hosts France after suffering a mysterious fit in the night before the final. The fit's circumstances still remain unclear and a source of speculation.
A year later he severely injured his right knee and was out of the game for several months. During his first comeback in 2000 he managed to play a few minutes during a league game against Lazio before injuring his knee for a second time. After 2 operations and 20 months of rehabilitation, Ronaldo managed a comeback during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He claimed the Golden Boot by scoring 8 goals during the tournament (and tied with Pele for a Brazilian record 12 total World Cup goals), leading Brazil to win an unprecedented fifth World Championship. In 2002, he was awarded the title of the World's best soccer player for the third time and transferred to Real Madrid. Ronaldo's ex-wife Milene Domingues (married in April 1999, divorced in September 2003) set the current female world record for keepie uppie in 1997. She was signed by Rayo Vallecano but plays football for Fiamma Monza. On June 2, 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick for Brazil against archrivals Argentina in a CONMEBOL qualifier for the 2006 World Cup. He scored all of Brazil's goals in a 3-1 win via penalty kicks.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Japanese Red Cross Society
WHAT: Tainted blood was used in Japan.
WHEN: 06/13/2003 - 07/21/2003
WHERE: Tokyo, Japan

Topic Explication
Japan's Red Cross shipped about 6,400 blood products possibly tainted with HIV, hepatitis or syphilis to patients across the country. 
Background
Contamination may have occurred because screening tests are often unable to detect viruses during the initial incubation period after infection. More than 7,000 blood donors who gave blood at least twice over the past year eventually ended up testing positive for HIV, hepatitis or syphilis. But their earlier blood samples tested negative and 6,419 units were processed into blood products and shipped for use. The Red Cross said it had recalled only 13 of the 6,419 possibly contaminated blood units, which suggests that the rest have already been used. However, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, has assured that the risk of infection from this blood is low, but that the Ministry will contact everyone to whom it was administered in order perform tests and confirm that no one has become infected.
The Ministry is advising recent transfusion recipients to seek follow-up testing and has urged the Red Cross to improve its blood screening methods. It also urged the association to store blood samples for at least four to six months to allow time for suspected cases of infection to arise before being shipped for use.

WHEN: 06/11/2003
WHERE: Sichuan Province, China

Topic Explication
The oldest signal station on the upper reaches of the Yantze River (called Chuanjiang) was demolished on June 11, 2003, resulting from the rise water level in the Three Gorges Reservoir built on the Yantze River. The signal station lies in the dangerous section of the Three Gorges that is noted for its rapids, whirlpools and shallows. The Three Gorges Project (Water Conservation Project) will make all the rapids, shallows and whirlpools on the Chuanjiang waterway disappear and double the width of its navigation channel. 
Background
The Yantze River has been plagued with many floods. In order to put an end to the natural disasters, the Chinese government decided to build a dam east of the Three Gorges. This water conservation project is known as the Three Gorges Project.
The first phase of water storage was planned to be completed in June 2003. By this date, everything below 135 meters (above sea level), in a 400-kilometer-long section west of the dam along the banks of the Yangtze, will be submerged. Many signal stations along the banks will, therefore, disappear. The signal stations are built to direct passage through sections with single routes, shallows, rapids or wirlpools.

55055.  Indianapolis 500 practice crash 
Seminal Event 


WHO: A.J. Foyt IV
WHAT: The youngest-ever Indianapolis 500 qualifier crashed for the second time during practice. The rookie was uninjured.
WHEN: 05/16/2003
WHERE: Indianapolis, Indiana

Topic Explication
A. J. Foyt IV, grandson of racing legend A. J. Foyt, crashed into a wall during practice for the 87th Indianapolis 500. He lost control of his No. 14 car as it entered a turn, sending it sliding up an embankment and rear-first into a restraining wall. Foyt IV is the youngest racer ever to qualify for the Indy 500. He will turn 19 on race day. He had already had one crash and narrowly escaped another during the practice for the event. None of the incidents involved other cars or drivers. 
Background
A. J. Foyt IV grew up on racing. His grandfather, considered by many to be the greatest American racecar driver of all time, is the A. J. Foyt, four-time champion of the Indianapolis 500, the marquee event that the Indy Racing League is virtually built around. And the original Foyt expected his grandson to follow in his footsteps. Foyt IV had been running go-carts and small cars since he was literally able to walk. He entered the world of competitive racing when he turned 9. At the age of 18, some say under heavy pressure from his grandfather, who owns the Foyt Racing Company, Foyt IV joined the Indy Racing League (IRL). He was out of his depth. In the first half of his first season (Jan-May 2003) Foyt IV had already crashed his car seven times. He had escaped several others, by his own admission, by sheer luck. The youngest IRL driver ever, Foyt IV made headlines for his distinguished lineage, his lack of success in the IRL, and the way he endangered his fellow drivers by not being completely in control of his vehicle.
Foyt IV has all the hallmarks of a great driver. And many contend that he still will be. He is simply too young. Most drivers do not jump directly from the "minor league" competitions like the Infinti Pro series straight into IRL competition. They spend some time attatched to a team as a test driver or in some other non-competitive capacity. The second-youngest rookie in 2003 is Scott Dixon, 22, and a driver of full-size Indy racecars for the past 3 years. The dominant sentiment in the league was that Foyt IV was allowed to enter the league so young (and stay in it after being in so many crashes) because of his name, rather than his qualifications.
Being the Foyt's grandson, there was much anticipation over Foyt IV's first Indy 500. While not many people expected him to win, a good showing would confirm the Foyt legacy. But as the race neared, it seemed that Foyt iV was not ready to step into the shoes of his lineage. He spun out in warmup for the qualifier, escaping disaster by the narrowest of margins, an inauspicious start despite his fourth-place finish. A cut tire led to another accident in practice a few days later. Then he spun out in the first turn and hit the wall. He escaped harm each time, and luckily no one else was involved. 
Foyt would go on to race in the Indy 500, but the only record broken was for being the youngest-known competitor, turning 19 on the day of the race. A faulty radio kept him from being competitive at the start of the race and continued to plague him all day, eventually necessitating a time-consuming repair job. Foyt IV was unable to be a major part of the competition, and ended up 18th after having started 23rd. 
He would go on to crash out in his second Indy 500 a year later.

WHAT: King Fahd had cataract removed from his left eye. He had a similar operation on his right eye last year. 
WHEN: 05/19/2003
WHERE: King Faisal Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Topic Explication
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia underwent cataract-removal surgery in Riyadh. 
Background
In July 2002, King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, leader of the House of Saud, and King of Saudi Arabia, left his Geneva estate and went to an elite Swiss hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove a cataract from his right eye. He has been almost entirely removed from the decision making process in Saudi Arabia, after a near-fatal stroke in 1996 left him largely incapacitated. Decisions are now made by his regent, Crown Prince Abdullah, his half-brother. King Fahd still attends certain ceremonies and receives rare visitors, but is largely removed from the government of Saudi Arabia and spends much of his time out of the country on vacation. At the time of the removal of his second cataract, from his left eye, King Fahd was eighty years old. The surgery was performed at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, and was deemed a complete success.

WHO: African Rainbow Minerals Gold (chairman: Patrice Motsepe); Harmony Gold Mining
WHAT: African Rainbow Minerals Gold and Harmony Gold Mining announced that they will merge.
WHEN: 05/05/2003
WHERE: Cape Town, South Africa

Topic Explication
Harmony, the primary acquiring firm, will acquire the entire issued share capital of ARMGold, the primary target firm. Harmony was already listed on both the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The name of the new mining company is HARMony, with an emphasis on "ARM" to represent ARMGold. Mr. Patrice Motsepe, the chairman of ARM, will become the non-executive chairman of the merged company. Mr. Bernard Swanepoel will remain the chief executive. Harmony will become the largest local gold producer in South Africa and the fifth largest in the world. 
Background
The complexity of the deal is driven in part by the demands of the South Africa's Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) charter, which calls for 15% of mining companies' local assets to have non-white ownership within 5 years and 26% in 10 years. This charter was put into effect by the government under pressure to redress the economic imbalance left by decades of apartheid rule, which excluded the country's huge black majority from the economy.

55063.  (SARS) Quarantined medics in Taiwan protest 
Seminal Event 


WHO: about 30 nurses and workers
WHAT: Hospital workers protested quarantine, saying it could expose healthy workers to the deadly disease, SARS.
WHEN: 04/25/2003
WHERE: Taipei, Taiwan

Topic Explication
On April 25, 2003, about 30 nurses and workers at the Hoping Hospital in Taipei, Taiwan protested being quarantined, due to SARS, for two weeks. Taiwan had reported 41 probable cases of SARS but no deaths. Hospital workers complained that confining people could expose staffers to the deadly disease. They protested by throwing bottles and paper out of windows and displaying banners saying "Wrong Policy" and "Long, long 14 days." 
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) appears to be caused by a previously unknown virus belonging to the coronavirus family. The incubation period usually ranges from two-to-seven days, but may be as long as ten days. The first symptom is usually fever, often accompanied by chills, headache, body aches, and malaise. This is typically followed by dry cough and difficulty breathing, at times severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. 
An outbreak of SARS was reported from Taiwan in March 2003, resulting in 674 cases and 84 deaths as of July 5 2004, chiefly from Taipei City and Taipei County. Most of the spread occurred within hospitals and other health care facilities. On July 5 2004, the World Health Organization announced that the outbreak had been terminated.

55064.  Next space tourist selected 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Space Adventures Co.
WHAT: Space Adventures Co. signed preliminary contract with future tourist (name not yet disclosed)
WHEN: 07/04/2003
WHERE: Moscow, Russia

Topic Explication
U.S. space tourism company, Space Adventures Ltd., which is located in Arlington, Virginia, selected the third tourist to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) on board a Russian rocket in 2004 or 2005. The potential space tourist's name has not been disclosed, but they must be physically able to endure space travel and able to pay $20 million for the ten-day trip. 
Background
In need of funds, the Russian space agency decided to send individual persons with only limited training into space to stay at the International Space Station. A ten-day trip cost $20 million. The United States, which is the main contributor to the 16-nation consortium which is building the ISS Alpha, initially objected to taking tourists into space. Their primary concerns were that minimally trained individuals without multilingual language skills would endanger the flight and the space station. Finally the U.S. conceded, reassured by NASA requirements which demands that tourists sign a legal document pledging that they and their heirs will not sue the space agency if anything goes wrong, and that they agree to pay for anything they break. 
After the Columbia Space Shuttle was destroyed while returning from orbit on February 1, 2003, the Russian government postponed plans to send more tourists into space while NASA investigated the disaster. Then, later in 2003, Russian officials announced that they would send two new space tourists to the International Space Station in 2004-2005. The Russian space agency Rosaviakosmos hired Space Adventures Ltd. of Arlington, Virginia, to locate persons physically capable of space travel and willing and able to pay $20 million each for ten-day flights. In 2004, the Russians announced that New Jersey businessman Gregory Olsen would become the third space tourist in April 2005. However, Russian physicians later blocked Olsen's trip to the ISS due to health concerns. Meanwhile, the Russians are holding seats for Space Adventures customers on four Soyuz flights to the ISS through 2007. Other prospective space tourists included pop star Lance Bass, model Cindy Crawford, former NASA associate administrator for policy planning Lori B. Garver, and Polish businessman Leszek Czarnecki. None of these supposed candidates ended up becoming the third private traveler to space.

WHAT: Justice Thomas Masuku is demoted to a lower court.
WHEN: Thursday, 04/03/2003
WHERE: Mbabane, Swaziland

Topic Explication
Justice Thomas Masuku, an outspoken critic of the Swaziland government's disrespect for the rule of law, is to be transferred to the Industrial Court, which amounts to a demotion. This comes just a day after the announcement of Chief Justice Stanley Sapire's resignation, which he tendered upon news of his impending demotion. Justice Thomas Masuku had publicly stated that he would not enterain any applications filed by 
the office of the Attorney General on behalf of government until the government showed that it was more responsible to the judiciary and the rule of law. 
Background
Swaziland was a British colony which won its independence in 1968. They adopted a consitiution, but it seriously co-opted by the King of Swaziland in 1973. The current battle with the judiciary started when the King refused to abide by a court order to let 200 residents return to their homes. They were originally evicted for refusing to acknowledge the rule of the King's older brother, Prince Maguga. Swaziland is the only nation on the African continent which is ruled by an absolute monarchy.

55066.  Bird Flu outbreak in Belgium

Seminal Event 


WHO: Belgian government
WHAT: The government issued tough restrictions on the transport of chickens and eggs.
WHEN: 04/16/2003
WHERE: Brussels, Belgium

Topic Explication
The Belgian government issued tough restrictions on the transport of chickens and eggs Wednesday after confirming its first outbreak of bird flu. The disease is often fatal for birds but is almost never contracted by humans. The significance of this particular article is that there have been a few deaths associated with this recent bird flu epidemic. The entire poultry sector will be immobilized and no contact between farms and other related businesses will be made. The government agency has begun culling some 250000 birds including, chickens, lay hens, ducks and geese, on farms located in a three kilometer zone around the Dutch border, in Meeuwen Gruitrode, where the first case was confirmed. 
Background
The European Commission on Tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the Netherlands to Belgium and claimed the life of a 57 year old Dutch veterinarian. Commission officials in Brussels banned the export of Belgian poultry products throughout the European Union and to other countries until Friday. Over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in Belgium's eastern Limburg region. The country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease. The avian flu spilled over into Belgium from the Netherlands, where it has devastated the poultry industry. Since the disease's discovery in February, Dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million. The export ban alone is costing the Dutch poultry industry an estimated .2 million ($2.2 million) a day.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Liberian President Charles Taylor
WHAT: Charles Taylor was indicted by a UN-backed court.
WHEN: 06/04/2003
WHERE: Monrovia, Liberia

Topic Explication
Former Liberian resident Charles Taylor was indicted on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war by a United Nations backed court in Sierra Leone. The announcement caused panic in Monrovia, where troops of Taylor's presidential guard overtook the city and closed shops, alarming residents. Prosecutors issued a warrant for Taylor, who was attending talks in Ghana with 15 other countries on peace negotiations in Liberia. 
Background
Charges were brought against Charles Taylor regarding his support for rebels in the neighboring Sierra Leone, who were responsible for extensive atrocities - including the hacking off of limbs, lips, and ears of civilians, sexual violence, use of child soldiers, abductions, and forced labor - during the nation's ten-year gruesome civil war. The indictment marked the second time that a sitting head of state was indicted by an international tribunal, Slobodan Milosevic being the first.
Charles Taylor has also been involved in a civil war in his own Liberia, where unrest has reigned since 1990. The previous war resulted in the death of 250,000 people, and an additional 300,000 Liberians have fled the country during the most recent conflict. He has battled insurgents since being elected under somewhat shady conditions in 1997.

55073.  Counsel Rape Charge 
Seminal Event 


WHO: J. Michael Boxley
WHAT: J. Michael Boxley, the counsel to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, was indicted on four counts of rape. He could face up to a maximum of 58 years in prison.
WHEN: 08/01/2003
WHERE: Albany, New York

Topic Explication
J. Michael Boxley, 44 year-old chief counsel to New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, was indicted on four counts of rape. The alleged victim is a 22 year-old staffer at the capitol, where Boxley works. 
Background
On the day in question, Boxley repeatedly pressured the young woman to go out for drinks with him after work, ignoring her protests that she already had plans. Eventually, she told him that she was going out to dinner with some friends in the nearby town of Troy. He insisted that she borrow his car for the drive, and that she return it later at a bar in Albany. She complied.
After dinner, she and her friends returned the borrowed Jaguar to the bar where Boxley was waiting with two colleagues. He insisted that they stay for a drink, and gave the victim a pint of dark beer. After a few sips, she became very tired and disoriented. Boxley helped her up from the bar and suggested that he take her home. She accompanied him to his car and passed out.
Some time later, she awoke, in her own bed, with Boxley raping her. She asked him to stop, but he did not. She passed out again. When she awoke, it was much later, and her head was beginning to clear. He was again forcing himself on her. She begged him to stop hurting her, and he did. He settled next to her in the bed and wrapped his arms around her affectionately.
When she awoke, Boxley was gone. She proceeded to follow her normal routine, appearing at work at her normal time. Several times during that day, Boxley called her cell phone, referring to her fondly as his "sweetie." Confused, she went to a hospital after work, where the doctor who examined her immediately called the police.

J. Michael Boxley was indicted on four counts of rape.
During the legal proceedings, the prosecution convinced the victim that there was not enough evidence to make the felony rape charges stick. She reduced the charges from rape to sexual misconduct. These stuck. During the trial, the defense focused all efforts on attacking the character of the victim, calling her in court "an uninhibited poster child for the wild side of Albany nightlife." They claimed that she had brought the assault on herself by her dress and drinking habits. This defense was not adequate. Boxley was convicted of misdemeanor sexual misconduct. He was given a thousand-dollar fine, six years of probation, and was made to register as a sex offender in New York State. He was fired from his $130,000 a-year job and suspended for one year from the New York Bar Association.
In 2001, Boxley was under investigation for a nearly identical rape charge involving another young female staffer at his place of business. He came to an out-of-court agreement and the charges were dropped. His latest victim has sued the State of New York for providing a work environment where she was allowed to come in contact with Boxley.

55074.  Burning crosses is a felony 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Supreme Court
WHAT: US Supreme Court made Cross-burning a felony.
WHEN: 04/08/2003
WHERE: Washington, D.C.

Topic Explication
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6 to 3 vote to make it a felony to burn crosses as a threat, but not as a freedom of expression. By allowing states to determine what is a threat, the Supreme Court has given the states room to allow people to burn the cross when they are expressing a political message, but to ban burning when it is about intimidation. 
Background
The use of the cross as "a tool for the intimidation and harassment of racial minorities, Catholics, Jews, Communists and any other groups hated by the Klan" is common knowledge. Cross burning can threaten an individual or result in a violent outbreak but it can also be thought of as people's right to use symbols to communicate. The U.S. Supreme Court must rule on the constitutionality of state statutes outlawing cross burning.

55075.  Greece: First probable SARS case 
Seminal Event 


WHO: SARS
WHAT: Greece sees its first possible case of SARS.
WHEN: 05/13/2003
WHERE: Athens, Greece

Topic Explication
SARS, an epidemic beginning in mid-November in Guangdong Province, China, initially appeared in Greece after a South African flight attendant who had gone through Hong Kong came down with a high fever and was quarantined in Athens. The patient was later determined not to have the disease. 
Background
SARS is a new disease which has its origins in Guangdong Province, China. The earliest known cases were identified in mid-November 2002. Since then, probable cases of SARS have been reported in 17 countries. 
WHO is constantly investigating and, where appropriate, verifying rumours about SARS coming in from a wide range of sources. 
The current cumulative number of cases of SARS is 2781 cases with 111 deaths, officially notified by ministries of health. The global case-fatality rate for probable SARS is 4%. 
SARS appears to be spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact involving exposure to infectious droplets, and possibly by direct contact with infected body fluids. 
China continues to see new cases of SARS although the numbers are decreasing following a peak in cases in February. To date, 1290 cases and 55 deaths have been reported from mainland China. 
Hong Kong is experiencing the second largest outbreak of SARS with 998 cases and 30 deaths. A significant outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment block between 27 March to 1 April resulted in a peak in cases. Stringent public health measures appear to have controlled the Amoy Gardens outbreak. However, cases continue to be reported in health care workers, and Hong Kong health authorities are strengthening their infection control and
community-based public health measures accordingly. 
Canada has experienced an outbreak of 97 probable SARS cases and 10 deaths. Up to now, the outbreak has been largely confined to Toronto. All cases have been epidemiologically linked to transmission related to a health care setting and transmission among close contacts of known SARS cases. In the Canadian outbreak, the higher case-fatality ratio appears to be linked to the older age of the patients, who frequently have underlying chronic disease. 
Although Singapore continues to see new cases, including clusters in hospital staff, inpatients, and visitors at two hospitals, the daily increase in numbers has decreased since a peak in mid-March. As of 10 April, a cumulative total of 126 cases with 9 deaths has been reported. Singapore is currently investigating a new cluster at the Singapore General Hospital affecting 52 persons in Wards 57 and 58, comprising 19 probable and 33 suspect SARS cases. The index case was admitted to this hospital on 24 March for the management of unrelated chronic illness, did not show characteristic SARS symptoms initially, and therefore was not placed in isolation and managed according to the principles of strict infection control. 
Cases continue to increase in the United States with 154 persons under investigation. US figures include probable and suspect cases. The US now reports limited transmission from patients to health care workers. No deaths have so far been reported from the US. 
Areas defined as "affected" are updated each day according to the latest data on cases and evidence of patterns of transmission. Epidemiological data indicate that SARS cases occurring in all other countries became infected while present in one of the affected areas or by direct contact with known cases of SARS.

WHAT: Ferry accident in Bangladesh, in the Buriganga river near Pagla. 
WHEN: 04/21/2003
WHERE: Dhaka, Bangladesh

Topic Explication
A ferry, the MV Mitali-3, which was carrying over 300 people, sank in the Buriganga river near Pagla. The double decker ferry was sailing from Dhaka to Paiserhat in Barisal. to Dhaka, when it was swamped by a storm 170 km from the capital. Ferries in Bangladesh don't always keep a list of passengers, making it difficult to determine the exact number. Around 130 bodies were recovered from the river. 
Background
Bangladesh has a long history of ferry disasters. Inland water transport authorities say about 1,000 people die in ferry accidents in the country on average every year, but the number of missing is far more. Many of these ferry accidents took place because of the lack of safety equipment.
Every year the country is hit by cyclones which sweep in from the Bay of Bengal. The ruling government had promised that it would improve safety on these ferries but little has been done.

WHAT: Looters scared local residents by rifling through one of Iraq's key nuclear sites.
WHEN: 05/07/2003
WHERE: Al-Tuwaitha, Iraq

Topic Explication
Looters frightened local residents in Al-Tuwaitha, Iraq by rifling through nuclear sites. The thieves stole whatever they could carry and pillaged for several days. Although there was only believed to be natural or low-grade uranium, the materials were still radioactive and had already caused deaths at the time this article was written. US military forces have received criticism over their allowance of the looting at the site. Experts from the Pentagon sent to the site were not able to tell whether dangerous materials were taken due to the heavy theft. 
Background
Due to the secrecy involved in Iraq's nuclear facilities during Saddam Hussein's regime, Iraqi citizens had not been aware of the potential danger in looting the materials. Reports from locals also indicated that shortly before the facility was destroyed, Iraq's biological weapons expert "Dr. Germ" was at the site and warned people not to go near the chemicals from the plant.

Topic Explication
China's national team thrashed a Washington Freedom team 8-0 in Friday's women's soccer friendly, which served as a warm-up for the upcoming World Cup. The game was held at the George Mason University of North Virginia on September 12th. 
Background
The Freedom played without top-scorer Mia Hamm and several starters at the George Mason University of North Virginia.
Forward Meng Juan scored twice in the second half while Sun Wen,Han Duan, Zhang Ouying, Teng Wei and Bi Yan having one each. The other one was an own goal of Freedom's center back Carrie Moore.
Led by Sun Wen and former Freedom defender Bai Jie, China took the complete control of the match from the very beginning, leaving no chance to the WUSA united team.The Freedom hardly had scoring opportunities at the front while their loose defense gave too much spaces to the Chinese strikers. China's coach Ma Liangxing said, "The united team didn't give us much pressure on defense, and that is not going to happen at the real World Cup competitions. They will press you on every touch, which will be tough for my players." Ma reshuffled the whole front line at the second half, when China scored six goals. "The Chinese team is strong, fast and deep. Their second team is as good as the starting lineup," said Freedom coach Jim Gabarra. China will kick off its World Cup journey on Sept. 22 against Ghana at Carson, California

WHAT: Ferry sinks in a river in southeast Bangladesh.
WHEN: 07/08/2003
WHERE: A river in Bangladesh

Topic Explication
A severely-crowded ferry, the MV Nazreen-1, sank on July 8, 2003, at the convergence of the Meghna, Padma, and Dakatia rivers, in Bangladesh. The triple-deck ferry, licensed to carry only 294 passengers, was holding around 1,000 people in addition to a sizeable cargo of rice and vegetables. The area in which the ferry sank is well-known to be a dangerous one, and ferries are generally advised to avoisd the Meghna confluence. As of July 19, 2003, only 165 bodies were recovered, and there were only 220 survivors. 
Background
Ferry disasters are not uncommon in Bangladesh. The country is criss-crossed by more than 8,000 miles of waterways. While ferries are therefore a necessary and inexpensive means of transportation, the boats themselves are in short supply, and BIWTA officials relax regulations in exchange for bribes from ferry operators.

WHAT: Floods and landslides in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have claimed 26 lives.
WHEN: 04/26/2003
WHERE: Xinjiang Province

Topic Explication
Floods and landslides in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have claimed 26 lives, with another three missing, according to local flood prevention authorities. The death was caused by an overnight torrential rainstorm that began late on Tuesday in the autonomous region's Ili River valley. The disaster has also claimed a large number of livestock. The highway between Gongliu County and Tekes County was washed away in four places, trapping over 100 cars. Houses in the two counties, and in Nilka County, were also damaged. 
Background
After the rain, a disaster rescue team was organized by the government and the army is clearing debris, allowing traffic through on main roads. But the local meteorological station warned of more rain and storms to come this season. Meanwhile, not only natural disasters claim lives. In the 600-kilometres-long Three Gorges Reservoir, 21 major shipping accidents happened despite improvements in navigation channels. The reservoir started to fill with water on June 1 and the water level has risen to about 118 meters. Seven people died and three were missing as a result of the accidents, most of which were caused by carelessness.

55085.  Pink Dolphin born in captivity 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Underwater World theme park on the resort island Sentosa
WHAT: First pink dolphin born in captivity.
WHEN: 11/2002 -- reported 06/04/2003
WHERE: resort island Sentosa

Topic Explication
The first Indo-Pacific Dolphin born in captivity came into the world in a Singapore marine park. This marks the first successful and documented birth of the species in any marine park. Also known as a pink dolphin, there exists little scientific information on the biology and reproduction of the endangered species, and there is hope that the birth will shed light on these areas, leading to the development of better focused conservation efforts. A marine conservation society reports that the best-known members of the species are found off of the Hong Kong coast. 
Background
A population of about 120 pink dolphins exist precariously in Hong Kong's harbor amidst many deterrents to their survival. Few fish controls in Hong Kong has led to overfishing, reducing the food source of the dolphins. Habitat loss has been fostered by the construction of a new airport - claiming at least 9.5 square kilometers of dolphin habitat - an expressway linking the airport to the rest of Hong Kong, and a new Disney theme park, in addition to land reclamation for housing, roads, and commercial development. Seventy percent of Hong Kong's daily two million tons of liquid waste go untreated, and 200,000 cubic meters of untreated sewage go into the harbor each day, resulting in an extensivly polluted habitat for the dolphins. Boat traffic most likely impedes the dolphins' ability to echolocate and communicate, in addition to posing the risk of direct collison. Small numbers have been captured for their meat, others become entangled in shark nets, and still others are captured for live display. Also found off the coasts of China, Thailand, Singnapore, and Vietnam, efforts began in 1995 by Hong Kong's Dolphinwatch to increase awareness of the plight of this endangered species.

55086.  Charges dropped for LA couple 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Isabella and Martin Behrens
WHAT: Criminal charges were dismissed for Mr. and Mrs. Behrens, arrested for allegedly battering police and resisting arrest.
WHEN: 06/27/2003
WHERE: Los Angeles, California

Topic Explication
Criminal charges have been dropped against Los Angeles residents Isabella Behrens and husband Martin, who were arrested for allegedly battering police officers during an arrest. The couple now plans to sue local authorities, claiming that they were beaten, falsely arrested, and framed. Behrens plans to file a federal civil rights lawsuit, and will target the officers involved in the incident. California police are investigating the incident, during which police officers arrived at the couple's home after they had left a twenty-dollar bar bill unpaid, which Isabella claims she promised to pay the following day. Once there, they are said to have brutalized Isabella and her mentally-ill husband, holding her in a head grip, beating her in the kidneys, and crushing Martin's head into the ground beneath their boots. Isabella received cuts and bruises, while her husband suffered a broken arm and a head injury. The couple's lawyer says that the dropping of the charges by the District Attorney proves their innocence. 
Background
The extent of police abuse and brutality has become more evident in recent years, though unjustified shootings, overly severe beatings and choking, and often fatal rough treatment remains widespread and often undocumented. Recently, the US Justice Department has undertaken federal investigations into accountability for officer misconduct, and requires subsequent reforms - such as stronger reporting mechanisms, better use-of-force training, and early warning systems - in lieu of taking injunctive action. The Report of the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department states that "[t]he problem of excessive force in the LAPD is fundamentally a problem of supervision, management, and leadership."
Isabella and Martin Behrens were French residents of California, introducing the possibility that police brutality may have been provoked or exacerbated due to their nationality. They plan to claim millions of dollars in damages. The couple was thrown out of the bar in which they did not pay their bill after Isabella poured water over a youth who was mocking her mentally-ill husband.

At least eight-five people died and three hundred fifty were injured in an earthquake that shook the Turkish province of Bingol on May 1. According to the local seismological center, the epicenter of the earthquake that measured six point four on the Richter Scale was situated in the Diyarbaki region in southeastern Turkey. Across the affected region around one hundred people are known to have died when the tremor struck at three o'clock in the morning local time, with a magnitude of six point four, its epicenter close to the city of Bingol. Thursday's quake lasted seventeen seconds, according to the head of Istanbul's Kandilli seismology center. Officials say the timing of the tremor, when people were at home asleep, could contribute to the death toll. 
Background
The electricity and telephone lines to the remote region have been cut. Rescue workers speak of massive devastation with buildings destroyed throughout towns and villages. Many buildings collapsed, including a four-storey dormitory of a boarding school near Bingol trapping around one hundred students.
Action by church organizations including CLWRC is monitoring the situation and may get involved if assistance is requested by the Turkish government.
Emergency workers are working into the night to try to rescue dozens of children thought to be trapped under the wreckage of a school dormitory after Thursday's powerful earthquake in southeastern Turkey. By Thursday evening more than ninety children had been saved, but another eighty-four were still unaccounted for.

WHO: officials in Ontario, Canada, Bush, news media, Canadian residents, commerce agencies
WHAT: Enormous power outage occurred in America and Canada.
WHEN: 08/14/2003
WHERE: Canada (Ontario, Toronto, Ottawa), United States of America

Topic Explication
Power is returning to Southern Ontario and parts of New York State, but the enormous blackout that struck the region on Thursday afternoon on August 14, 2003 is far from over. The Power supply is still not stable in Ontario, and the Ontario officials are making effort to prevent the blackout from happening again. The investigation disclosed that the blackout was initiated when three high-voltage transmission lines went out of service. The wide magnitude of the affected area was also caused by the fact that the alarm system wasn't working properly and the control-room operator was unaware that transmission lines had gone down. President Bush, though acknowledged that the electricity system in Northeast America was out of date, has objection to rennovating electricity supply system. 
Background
Since the blackout, a US-Canada Task Force has been working to investigate the blackout. The events that caused the blackout include that the high-voltage transmission lines short-circuited and went out of service; the control-room alarm system wasn't working properly; FirstEnergy operators did not know their monitoring equipment had failed; the loss of the three lines resulted in too much electricity flowing onto other nearby lines and caused them to overload; the MISO's system analysis tools weren't performing effectively, which prevented MISO from becoming aware of the problems; other factors contributing to the blackout include poor communications, human error, mechanical breakdowns, inadequate training, software glitches, and insufficient attention to things such as the performance of sophisticated computer modeling systems.

55096.  McDonald's bombing

WHAT: Home-made bomb in McDonald's does not result in any injuries. Business resumes in the restaurant the same day. Extensive investigation is under way.
WHEN: 06/16/2003
WHERE: Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, NW China

Topic Explication
A homemade bomb constructed with a common pressure cooker exploded in the afternoon in a McDonald's men's room in the Gulou outlet in Xi'an. There were no injuries, and business resumed the same day. 
Background
In Xi'an, the fast food might kill you. No need to worry about hardening arteries and morbid obesity; death could come much more quickly and violently. The capital of northern China's Shaanxi province has a history of bombing American fast food joints. This latest bomb was simply a continuation of an established pattern.
In December, 2001, a McDonald's in Xi'an blew up. Two people were killed, and 27 more were injured. Speculation that it was a suicide bomb was squashed when the police investigators discovered a number of detonators at the scene. It had to have been an organized hit, with a planted bomb detonated at a specific time. A random crime became suddenly more sinister.
Seen in the light of this carnage, the bomb of June 15th, 2003 seems almost comical. But it wasn't a joke at all. The bomb was a homemade job, with a timer and detonator attached to a common pressure cooker. It is not clear whether explosives were used, or if the bomb simply was the pressure cooker, overcharged and ready to blow. Regardless of the fact that this sort of bomb did not threaten the entire building, had anyone been in the men's room at the time, they could have been severely injured or even killed. It was still an attempt to injure the patrons of the pervasive multinational.
Business resumed almost immediately after the explosion. In fact, another McDonald's Xi'an lost more business when it had to be closed the next day after an anonymous phone call told the police that a bomb had been planted on the premises. The McDonald's had to be closed for more than two hours while the bomb squad went over the establishment witha fine-toothed comb. No bomb was found.
The next day, at a KFC outlet nearby, a similar call was placed, police say using a public phone. Again, the establishment had to be shut down while the bomb squad went in to check it out. And again, there was no bomb.
McDonald's has been a favorite target of anti-American bombing campaigns all over the world. It is seen as the worst sign of globalization and cultural infringement.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Lt. Isa Abdulla al-Baloushi
WHAT: Aquitted on terrorism, charged for illegal weapons possession.
WHEN: Sunday, 09/07/2003
WHERE: Manama, Bahrain

Topic Explication
National Guard officer Lt. Isa Abdulla al-Baloushi was acquitted of terrorism charges by a Bahraini court. He was believed to be a part of a group of five men who allegedly were planning attacks in Bahrain, headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th fleet. Though acquitted of these charges, he has however been sentenced to three years in jail for illegally possessing weapons, as well as being fined 500 dinars (US $1326) for the weapons conviction and ending his service with the Bahrain National Guard. Of the five men detained uder charges of allegedly planning terror attacks, three were released without charge. 
Background
Bahrain has had a strengthened strategic alliance with the United States since 1991. Most recently, the country provided bases for the US during Opertations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. In addition to playing host to the US Navy's Fifth fleet, Bahrain is also the regional base for many US banks and firms. Accordingly, this Western influence forms a large source of annoyance to Islamic fundamentalists, which may result in terror attacks. The Western world and Bahraini government is well aware of the threat of terrorism in the country, prompting the Foreign Office to instruct British nationals to leave unless their presence was "essential." The nation has made a vow to aid in the battle against international terrorism, and has trained Bahraini troops alongside US forces to learn anti-terrorism techniques as well as drafting new, tougher anti-terrorist legislation.
In July of 2004 over 650 Americans were evacuated from Behrain after the US claimed "credible" news of a planned attack and the US Department of State urged American citizens to depart.

55107.  Casablanca bombs 
Seminal Event 


WHO: unknown
WHAT: At least 39 were killed and dozens more injured in the blasts.
WHEN: 05/16/2003
WHERE: Casablanca, Morocco

Topic Explication
Five targets were hit nearly simultaneously by suicide bombers at 10 pm on May 16th in Casablanca. The blasts killed 12 bombers and 33 civilians. 
Background
The blasts killed 12 bombers and 33 civilians. In the end, it was the inaptitude of the bombers that saved dozens of lives. The attacks were not well-planned to begin with, and then the attacks were moved forward several days, apparently inspired by the bombings in Riyadh the week before. This threw the bombers' plans into disarray. The best example of this is the solo bomber who was probably supposed to attack a Jewish cemetery. He got lost, and wandered around. He finally blew himself up, late, beside a fountain, killing three civilians, all devout Muslims. He was still 150 yards away from the cemetery. But other targets were also disasters for the bombers. Two were supposed to attack a Jewish community center near the targeted cemetery. Normally, this would have been packed with people eating, playing cards, and dancing. But the center was closed on the new date of the bombings. When the two bombers exploded themselves outside of the community center, they (and the architecture) were the only casualties. 

Not that the attacks were a joke, but they could have been much worse. Three bombers were assigned to a popular Jewish-owned Italian restaurant across the street from the Belgian consulate. The attempted attack was all captured on the surveillance cameras of the consulate. Three young men tried to gain entrance to the restaurant, but the doorman refused to admit them. One of the men ran away, and the other two blew themselves up in the street. The blasts killed the two bombers and two policemen guarding the Belgian consulate. No one in the restaurant was killed, although the building did sustain significant damage. 

Several more bombers targeted the five-star Sirah (also called Farah) Hotel in the heart of the city. Their timing was poor, however, and they appear to have been hindered in their attempts to gain access to the hotel, where a large Jewish delegation was staying. The bombs went off before they got properly inside, killing the bombers, a guard, and a porter. There was an additional bomber who arrived late, tried to run away after he saw that the bombs had already gone off in the hotel, and was apprehended and detained by angry local citizens. 

It was only at the Casa de Espana Spanish restaurant that the plan came off as it had been drawn up. Mulitple bombers walked in the front door and attacked the guard/doorman, cutting his head off with a large knife. They then walked into the crowded establishment and set off their bombs. The carnage was awful. 20 people were killed, blown to pieces, in addition to the bombers, and an unknown number wounded, some seriously. All the blasts had occurred nearly simultaneously. There had been no warning. Had the attacks come off as planned, they would have killed dozens more. 

Thankfully, the inaptitude 20-24 year-old attackers prevented much greater loss of life. Despite their (relative) good luck, Casablanca was shaken and angry. 12 suicide bombers had killed themselves, taking 33 civilians with them. 27 Islamic extremists were arrested the next day. Morocco called for international support in apprehending and prosecuting those responsible. This came immediately. 

The world powers united in their condemnation of the terrorists and their actions. It was suspected that al Quaeda was involved directly or indirectly, prompting another roundup of suspected al Quaeda operatives, some of which remain in detention without trial in the US prison at Guantanamo Bay. Eventually, the extremist group Sulafia Jihadia, which does have several al Quaeda connections, was blamed for the bombings. All of the suspected members of the organization were rounded up. 

There were 634 arrests in total. 87 were put on trial for involvement in the terrorist organization. Not one was acquitted. Two of the defendants, due to their youth, were sentenced to ten months in jail. Eleven others received prison sentences from six to ten years. Sixteen 20-year sentences were handed down, seventeen 30-year sentences, and 37 were sentenced to remain in prison for the rest of their natural lives. Four were given the death penalty, including the suspected mastermind behind the attacks.

Topic Explication
Israel withdraws troops from N. Gaza. 
Background
This agreement marks a major step towards implementing the US backed road map for peace in the Middle East. The "road map" for peace is a plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict proposed by a four international entities: the United States, the EU, Russia, and the UN . The principles of the plan were first outlined by U.S. President George W. Bush in a speech on June 24, 2002, in which he called for an independent Palestinian state living side by side with the Israeli state in peace. 
In exchange for statehood, the road map requires the Palestinian Authority to make democratic reforms and abandon the use of terrorism. Israel, for its part, must support and accept the emergence of a reformed Palestinian government and end settlement activity of the Gaza Strip and West Bank as the Palestinian terrorist threat is removed.

WHEN: Monday, 04/07/2003
WHERE: Iraq

Topic Explication
Gen. Tommy R. Franks traveled into the heart of Iraq, his first steps on Iraqi soil since the beginning of the war. 
The roughly seven hours Franks spent in the country were divided between formal military briefings and affectionately profane back-slapping sessions with U.S. and British ground troops. But the visit of the supreme commander also was was designed to demonstrate that much of Iraq is now under the control of U.S. and British forces. 
The general was accompanied by a journalist, and a narrative of his trip was made available to other reporters. 
Franks took tea with officers from the British 1st Armoured Division after the classified military briefing in Zubayr. 
Franks addressed a couple of hundred Marines assembled in the dust before leaving the encampment at Numaniya. 
Background
Franks and his small but heavily armed security contingent flew by helicopter across the Kuwaiti border to a British command post in Zubayr, south of Basra, before traveling by C-130 to a U.S. Marine encampment in Numaniya. Clearly enjoying himself, the general walked down the plane's back ramp and shouted,
"Showtime!" 
Franks did not enter Baghdad, the capital city deemed not yet secure. But he got his first glimpse of Iraqi civilians upon arrival in An Najaf, a city on the Euphrates River about 100 miles south of Baghdad. 
Many of the civilians who lined up to watch his military convoy waved, blew kisses or gave the thumbs-up sign. Franks later said the sight of welcoming adults, as well as children, who tend to be entertained by military hard ware, let him form opinions about how long the war might last. 
"And I probably won't tell you what those opinions are," Franks said. "It was encouraging."

WHEN: Announcement: 06/08/2003; Meeting: 06/21/2003 - 06/23/2003
WHERE: Dead Sea (?) shore, Jordan

Topic Explication
Jordan prepares for the World Economic Forum meeting in Jordan, when a group of over 1,000 business and civic leaders from 65 countries will convene to discuss political and social issues. No one not registered for the Forum was allowed within a mile of the site. 
Background
1,000 business and civic leaders from 65 countries will convene to discuss political and social issues. 

Since 1971, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been the premiere place to swing big deals between big businesses. Although the WEF claims that it is an informal meeting of important people dedicated to solving the world's problems, it is often criticized for being little more than a watering hole for rich multinationals, where they can make deals that exploit poor nations. The membership of the Forum is overwhelmingly American, European, and Japanese, and, until 2001, exclusively male. Notable figures include Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and more than 20 members of the US Congress. Invitations are extended to influential political figures in large countries and selected companies that make more than a billion US dollars per year. This creates a slight under-representation for small, poor countries. 

Although the WEF bills itself as a progressive organization dedicated to the solution of world poverty, hunger, and isolation, it has not, in fact, taken any major steps to achieve any of these. Environmental reforms have also repeatedly failed to gain approval by the WEF. In 2001, Greenpeace withdrew from the annual meeting due to a lack of cooperation and interest on the part of the rest of the forum.

This severe heat wave has affected 23 districts of Andhra Pradesh, eight of them most severely. The maximum temperature has been 7 to 10 degrees above normal. In Andhra Pradesh, more than 1300 people are reported to have lost their lives due to the severe heat wave. Most of the victims were daily wage laborers, rickshaw puller or construction workers and are from the Below Poverty Line (BPL) households. 
Background
The Government of Andhra Pradesh has announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs. 10,000/- to the next of kin of the victim and have advised the people not to work from 12.00 noon to 3.00 p.m. 
In response to a Government request UNICEF supported the Government of Orissa by providing 3.5 million Oral Dehydration Salts sachets, 5 million halogen tablets, and 2000 bags of 25 kg bleaching powder for distribution in the affected districts. UNICEF is working very closely with the health department, women and child development department and the Relief Commissioners' offices in the states and is assisting the state governments in responding effectively to the heat wave situation.The severity of the heat wave has been aggravated by the continuing drought in most of these states. However, the heat wave will be contained soon due to the onset of the monsoon rains. As the heat wave condition has been associated with the drinking water shortages and severe drought situations in these states, UNICEF support has to be in terms of emergency preparedness through wider dissemination of practices to avoid heat strokes. the Government has advised the people to stay away from outdoor work during the peak hours from11.30 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. All the hospitals, primary health centers and dispensaries have prepared themselves for treating the heat stroke victims. Water huts have been opened in all the affected districts of Western
Orissa. The examination timings have been rescheduled. Control rooms are operational in all the affected districts. 
Heat wave conditions have also developed in parts of Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Rajsthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh. No respite is forecast for Pakistan, however, where the worst heat wave for years has sent temperatures above 51C in some parts.

WHO: Two or three Moslems
WHAT: A group of active and dangerous Moslems attacked an Indian army base. 
WHEN: 07/22/2003
WHERE: DANDA army base (25 Km West Gamo), Kashmir 

Topic Explication

Background
The conflict in Kashmir is nearly 60 years old, going back to 1947 when Britain granted independence to the Indian subcontinent as two countries: India and Pakistan. Various autonomous states were given the choice of which country to join, Kashmir among them. The maharaja of Kashmir acceded to India, an action which Pakistan does not acknowledge. Officially India controls 63% of the region; Pakistan the remaining 37%.
The latest stage of conflict dates back to 1999, and is currently in a cease-fire, officially. Many of the breaches of the cease-fire are by Muslim terrorists.

Background
The 45-day truce, termed a Hudna, was effected by Hamas and other Islamic troops despite the fact that the Israeli government refused to agree to it. It was a controversial cease-fire. Its advocates claimed that it would provide room for reconciliation and a calming of hatred between the two sides. Others saw it as little more than a time for the Islamic groups to recuperate, gather their forces, and coordinate fresh attacks without the pressure of being hunted. The negotiations were, in the end, moot, because Israel struck in the middle of the Hudna, killing two prominent officials in the Hamas orginization. Hamas and Jihad immediately called an end to the truce, and hostilities resumed.

55155.  Chinese Submarine Accident 
Seminal Event 


WHO: 70 officers and crew members
WHAT: 70 officers and crew members were killed in an accident on board a Chinese submarine.
WHEN: 05/02/2003
WHERE: off the coast of Liaoning province

Topic Explication
Unspecified mechanical failures in the No 361 submarine resulted in the death of all seventy Chinese sailors aboard east of the Neichangshan islands. At the time, the submarine was taking place in a drill. The vessel was later towed to an unidentified port. All crew members were found still at their posts, and appeared to have died from suffocation. The accident occurred while the submarine was on the surface, and it is not clear how long ago the accident happened before it was discovered, nor how much time elapsed between the discovery and the informing of the public. 
Background
Many of the vessels in China's substantial submarine fleet - about 40 to 100 submarines - are relatively old. Despite the fact that China's military spending went up 17.6% to 169 billion yuan (20 billion dollars) in 2002, it spends little in this sector compared to developed countries; the country is also having trouble with its submarine manufactoring program. Moreover, the navy has reported operating problems due to inadequate crew training; human error is thought to be the cause of the No. 361 accident. The accident highlights China's growing involvement in submarine operations, whose Navy is trying to project more force regionally by improving its ability to send subs on extended patrols.
The accident has been billed as the first submarine accident since the People's Republic of China came into existence in 1949; at the very least it is the first fatal submarine accident reported to the public. After embarking on a large-scale submarine program which included the manufacture of diesel-electric patrol submarines and nuclear-powered submarines in the 1960s, China began making submarines of its own design in the 1970s. The 250-foot No. 361 Ming-Class submarine involved in the accident - one of 19 - was Chinese-made. China has been known to use its domestically-built submarines carefully and infrequently. An investigation showed no damaged or sign of attempted escape.
Though little information was revealed, it was a surprise that the crash was reported to the Chinese public; the rare disclosure seems to indicate a pledge to promises of greater candor and accountability on the part of the country's leadership. The accident is also being used by President Hu JIntao as an example of the nation's need for rapid modernization.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Brazil's agriculture research institute
WHAT: Scientists in Brazil succeeded in producing a calf from the cells of a dead cow using cloning technology. 
WHEN: 09/04/2003
WHERE: Brazil

Topic Explication
Scientists in Brazil claim they have succeeded in creating a living cow from the cells of a dead cow using cloning technology. The calf, born on September 4, was in perfect health. The technique could also be used to replace dead members of endangered species. 
Background
The project came about as the result of an accidental death. An eight-year-old cow called T Melo Lenda, who had earned renown as a milk producer, was killed accidentally on November 5. Although her owners extracted her ovaries, the eggs would not germinate. So Rumpf and his team used cells gathered from the outer ovaries to clone the cow, called Lenda. Lenda joins a growing list of animal species that scientists have cloned from adult cells, comprising horses sheep, mice, rabbits, goats, cats and pigs. 
Rodolfo Rumpf, who led the research for Investigaciones Agropecuarias (Embrapa), said that cloning can be used when an animal of high genetic value has died from an accident. Cattle have been cloned before initially by scientists in New Zealand but Lenda is the first to be cloned using a dead cows cells. On March 17, 2001, Brazil became a pioneer in the cloning of animals in Latin America with the birth of a calf named Vitoria da EMBRAPA.

55159.  Bill Duffy's error will cost Anthony Carter $3.4 million 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Anthony Carter of the Miami Heat, Bill Duffy (Carter's agent)
WHAT: An error made by his agent, Bill Duffy, will cost Anthony Carter of the Miami Heat 3.4 million dollars.
WHEN: 07/08/2003
WHERE: America

Topic Explication
Bill Duffy, the agent for Miami Heat guard Anthony Carter, forgot to notify the Heat by June 30 that Anthony Carter would invoke the player option on the final season of this original three-year $12 million contract. The mistake made Anthony Carter a free agent, and gave the Heat an additional $4.1 million to spend on free agents this summer. Carter will likely sign with another team, but will find a contract that only approaches 700 thousand. The consequence is Carter will probably lose 3.4 million. 
Background
"I feel sick for the person in our office who was responsible (for monitoring Carter's situation and contacting the Heat) and he feels sick about it," Duffy said. "This is obviously an unfortunate situation, but it's my name on the company and I'll take responsibility for it."
Duffy, who refused to name the employee, ranks as one of the leagues most well-respected agents, with a client list featuring three of the top four picks in the 2002 draft: Houston's Yao Ming, Chicago's Jay Williams and Orlando's Drew Gooden. In October, Duffy was named one of the NBA's top 25 "shapers and shakers" by ESPN The Magazine.
It remains to be seen how the Heat will proceed in response to the Carter camp's costly mistake or the potential windfall that stems from the error. Carter's contract previously had been regarded as one of the main impediments to Miami making a free-agent splash, since his production last season -- 4.1 points per game on 35.6-percent shooting -- is not commensurate with a $4 million player.

Topic Explication
Three coaches of a train derail at a tunnel entrance near Kankavali in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra state, after rain washes boulders onto the track. Fifty one people are killed. 
Background
The passenger train derailed at the entrance of a tunnel when it hit boulders that had fallen on the track due to landslides and heavy rains. 
The accident occurred about 575 kilometres south of India's commercial capital Bombay. 
Twenty-five passe ngers, including a 3-year-old girl, were injured in the crash. 
India has one of the world's largest railway networks with almost 14,000 trains carrying more than 13 million passengers a day. It has about 300 accidents a year. 
Soldiers, railway teams and local police, working in hilly terrain, used gas-powered metal cutters to cut through the remains of a coach crushed against a mountainside. 
The train was coming from the port city of Karwar in southern Karnataka state and was headed to Bombay when four coaches jumped tracks and one of them slammed into a coach in front, trapping it against the mountainside, railway officials said. 
The accident was the most serious to take place on the western coastal rail corridor, called the Konkan Railway, built across treacherous hills and touted as a major engineering feat when it opened five years ago. 
In May, fire raced through a crowded passenger train in northern India, killing 38 people, many while they slept.

55162.  Supreme Court rules for affirmative action 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Supreme Court
WHAT: Favorable verdict ruling that selection process for college admission favors minority students.
WHEN: 06/24/2003
WHERE: United States

Topic Explication
The United States Supreme Court ruled that considering race when accepting or denying applicants for admission into the University of Michigan law school was constitutional. 
Background
In 1996, Barbara Grutter was rejected by the University of Michigan law school, despite being qualified for admission. She responded by filing a lawsuit against the president of the school, Lee Bollinger, an outspoken advocate of affirmative action. She had been refused, she said, because she was white, and the school placed emphasis on admitting Hispanic and African American students. Statistically, minority applicants were favored over white applicants, and she had been denied her rightful place because of her skin color.
The Supreme Court had ruled in 1978 that it was admissible for organizations to prioritize minority admissions in the interests of diversity. For 25 years after, they had refused to hear any more cases on affirmative action. The Grutter case made its way up through the courts in the usual fashion, and the Supreme Court finally agreed to hear it. 
This case was a landmark, not only because it was so controversial, but also in that it was very public. The media were allowed to record the hearings for only the second time in the courts history. It was a close vote. In the end, Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter, Ginsberg, and Breyer found in favor of Bollinger, and Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas dissented. The 5-4 ruling was announced on June 23rd, 2003.
Although it is admissible for colleges to consider race while evaluating applications, the decision also upheld the previous ruling that quotas were not acceptable. The Grutter case was heard in conjunction with "Gratz vs. Bollinger," which cited the same defendant and was aimed at the overly mathematical approach to affirmative action that the school employed. In that case, the court ruled against the University of Michigan, calling on them to restructure their points-based affirmative action system.
Barbara Grutter now runs a small business from home and cares for her two small children.

55166.  Suicide bomber hits Moscow concert 
Seminal Event 


WHO: dead and injured, two suicide bombers
WHAT: At least 20 were killed and 30 seriously injured when two female suicide bombers blew themselves up at a Moscow rock concert.
WHEN: 07/05/2003
WHERE: Moscow, Russia

Topic Explication
Two female suicide bombers attempted to gain access to the fourth annual Krylya rock festival at the Tushino airfield in Moscow. When they were denied access to the airfield, they detonated their explosives at the entrance. The explosions came within fifteen minutes of each other, at different entrances. Had the bombers gained access to the concert, where 20,000 young Muscovites were packed, or had their explosives fully detonated, the casualties would undoubtedly have been much higher. 
Background
At first, they thought that it was just fireworks. It was a rock festival, after all. Big loud noises were to be expected. Then they saw the blood, and knew that something was horribly wrong. The bomber had been stopped at the gate by the security guards. She had torn open her coat and detonated an explosive belt. The belt only partially exploded, but its lethality was enhaced by the shrapnel that she had strapped to herself. A similar event, less than fifteen minutes later caused the concert to be largely evacuated. More than 60 people were taken to the hospital. 23 were taken to the morgue.
The women were both young, like the concertgoers they were targeting. One was found with a passport on her. She had a Chechen name.
The latest attacks were just slight spikes in the barrage of tragedy and atrocity that has highlighted the Russian struggle to supress militant separatists in Chechnya. Tens of thousands on both sides have been killed in the decade-long struggle. Estimates run on the high side of 150,000 deaths since 1994. Chechen separatists have pursued a terrorist campaign against Russian targets, while Russian occupying forces repond with wanton viciousness. In June of 2003, a woman in a white lab coat packed with explosives threw herself under a Russian troop transport bus, killing seventeen. In 2002, perhaps encouraged by the recent downing of a Russian helicopter that killed more than 100 people, Chechen rebels took over a Moscow theater, taking some 800 hostages. After a several-day standoff, Russian Special Forces flooded the ventilation system with an unknown opiate gas and stormed the theater. More than 150 of the hostages and 41 of the attackers were killed, most of them from inhaling too much of the gas.
Russia has refused all proposals granting the Chechen region its independence, holding on to it because of its important oil fields. Regional elections were held for the first time in 2003, but the former separatist leader who was elected was seen as a traitor and was assassinated with a landmine planted under his stage at a parade. The conflict continues today.

WHERE: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia

Topic Explication
A Russian Kosmos-3M booster rocket took the first Nigerian satellite into orbit on September 27, 2003 after a 24-hour delay. The satellite is to be used for monitoring weather and natural disasters, mapping, territorial surveillance and data gathering. 
Background
People have argued that a country where more than 80 million out of 126 million citizens live in poverty ought not to be spending its limited resources on a space program. But other people say that for large countries such as Nigeria, space-based observation can make economic sense since monitoring things like deforestation and water resources from the ground can be very laborious.
Unexplained technical problems delayed the launch for one day. 5 Nigerian engineers and scientists had been working on the 13-million-dollar project. The launch means Nigeria becomes the third African country to have a presence in space, after South Africa and Algeria.
After the launching, Nigeria would start working toward the National Satellite II. The first satellite would address the issues of remote sensing which involved the understanding and management of environment and natural resources using space-acquired information. The second satellite, tagged "Communication Satellite," would be concerned with information technology.

WHO: Russian troops, rebels
WHAT: Nine Russian soldiers were killed and 5 people wounded in an ambush.
WHEN: 07/12/2003
WHERE: Shatoi region of southern Chechnya, Russia

Topic Explication
Rebels ambushed a Russian military vehicle in the Shatoi region of southern Chechnya, killing nine soldiers and wounding five. The soldiers were traveling in a heavy Kamaz truck when they hit a remote-controlled land mine. Rebels then ambushed the vehicle, launching grenades and firing automatic weapons at the truck. 
Background
Russian troops have been bogged down in Chechnya since 1999 when they returned to the republic following the rebel raids on a neighboring Russian region and a series of deadly apartment-house bombings in Russian cities.
2003 Fighting continued between Russian armed forces and rebels in Chechnya and in bordering areas. The rebels engaged the numerically superior and better equipped Russian forces, largely through guerilla tactics such as ambushes and bombings. Despite few reported rebel casualties, it is widely held that the Russian security forces were active in abducting, detaining and killing hundreds of alleged rebels. Civilians continued to be killed by both sides and a surge of suicide bombings in and around Chechnya, targeted mainly at Russian governmental and military establishments, resulted in approximately 200 deaths, many of them civilian. Both conflict parties continued to use land-mines and reports of child fighters within Chechen ranks persisted. 
Terminology
Timeline
2003: Fighting remained intense as Chechen rebels continued a guerilla campaign against Russian governmental and military targets, while Russian security forces continued abducting, detaining and allegedly killing suspected rebels. Although Moscow heralded the October presidential election in Chechnya as progress towards peace, many questioned its legitimacy and capacity to end the conflict. It is estimated that close to 5,000 soldiers, rebel fighters and civilians were killed in 2003.
2002: Fighting escalated this year with both sides stepping up attacks on each other and civilians. The conflict received enormous international attention in October when Chechen rebels took approximately 800 people hostage in a Moscow theater, calling into question Russian government claims that it had successfully ended the war in Chechnya.
2001: Bombings, assassinations and guerrilla attacks were almost a daily occurrence and a number of fierce rebel offensives were launched during the year. Representatives of the Russian government and Chechen rebels met for talks in November.
2000: In early February Russian forces captured the Chechen capital, Grozny, forcing rebels to retreat to a stronghold in the southern mountains. Since, the war has evolved into guerrilla fighting against Russian personnel and assets. Hundreds of people, and possibly thousands, were killed in the fighting in 2000.
1999: A second phase of the Russia-Chechnya armed conflict began in 1999 after Russian troops launched attacks against the breakaway republic of Chechnya following two invasions B attributed to Islamic rebels B into the neighboring republic of Dagestan. By December,the Russian military had captured several key Chechen towns and controlled almost all the lowlands of northern Chechnya. Later attacks targeted the area in and around Grozny. Over 2,000, and as many as 5,000, people died in the fighting.
1996: The Russian-Chechen Truce Agreement was signed in 1996 ending a two-year war between the two sides which began in 1994 when Russian troops invaded Chechnya. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 lives, mostly civilian, were lost in the first phase of the w ar.

Topic Explication
The Guinea-Bissau military staged an apparently bloodless coup on Sunday as President Kumba Yala was reported in the custody of soldiers in the impoverished west African country.

55180.  Schroeder demands apology from Berlusconi 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Gerhard Schroder (Germany Chancellor), Silvio Berlusconi (Italian prime minister)
WHAT: Schroder demands an apology from the Italian prime minister.
WHEN: 07/03/2003
WHERE: Berlin, Germany

Topic Explication
After Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi suggested that a German deputy and member of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats "play a role of Kapo (a Nazi concentration camp guard)...[in a] film about the Nazi concentration camps," the German Chancellor demanded a full and formal apology, labelling the comment as "inappropriate and completely unacceptable in content and form." Berlusconi was widely condemned in the media and by European MPs on all political sides for his remark, though there was no official governmental condemnation. The incident occured just a day after the start of Italy's six-month presidency of the European Union, prompting concern from EU members. Press comment around Europe was almost uniformly negative; one media source claimed that Berlusconi had begun the Italian presidency "in the worst way possible." 
Background
Germans remain incredibly sensitive to their Nazi past; references making light of the dictatorship's reign often cause outrage. Last year, Schroeder fired a justice minister after she made a comparison between Adolf Hitler and George W. Bush's tactics in Iraq. The Chancellor's predecessor was asked to apologize after likening Social Democrat speaker of parliament to Hermann Goering, president of the Nazi Reichstag. German law prohibits the possession, import, or export of literature, music, or other paraphanelia that glorifies facism, the Nazi past, or the former Third Reich. Making the sitff-armed Nazi salute is illegal.
Berlusconi declined to publicly retract the comment or apologize, although Schroeder said that the Prime Minister "expressed regret for the choice of [the] expression and comparison" after the two shared a phone call. A statement released by Berlusconi's office also evaded an apology, stating regret not for the PM's comment, but "...for the fact that someone could have misunderstood the meaning of a joke that was only meant to be ironic... If people are not able to understand irony, I am very sorry, that's too bad." Though he said that he did not mean to offend German feelings, he declined to apologize directly to Schulz.
Berlusconi's loose tongue has long been the purporter of off-the-cuff inappropriate comments, stating among other things that "Mussolini never killed anyone...[he] sent people on holiday," that "beautiful secretaries [who are] superb girls" were a reason "to invest in Italy," expressing "the superiority of [Western] civilization...in contrast to Islamic countries," calling the Italian left-wing press a "cancer," telling an offensive joke about AIDS, and referring to himself as the "best political leader in Europe and the world."

On Nov.6, 2002, Chinese Middle east envoy Wang Shijie arrived in Cairo, the first station of his first Middle East visit.
China's Five-Point Proposal on the Current Middle East Question:
1. The Chinese side welcomes and supports the "road map" peace plan for the Middle East officially announced by the "Quartet," believing that the "road map" is positive in content and provides a sound basis for resumed talks between Israel and Palestine. It is hoped that the two sides will seize this opportunity and take feasible measures to cooperate with the international community in its efforts for peace and an early solution to Palestine's questionable status. 
2. It is time that both Israel and Palestine officially announce their acceptance of the "road map" plan and implement it as soon as possible. The top priority is for both sides to stop violence and revenge promptly, so as to pave the way for the resumption of the talks and the conclusion of an agreement. We call upon Israel to withdraw its troops to the position held before September 28, 2000, end military strikes, political isolation, economic blockade against Palestine, the policy of"targeted assassination," freeze the construction of Jewish settlements, ease humanitarian crisis in Palestine, and restore the freedom of movement of Chairman Yasser Arafat. In the meantime, Israel's security should be fully guaranteed. The Palestinian National Authority has the duty to take effective measures to stop extremist and violent activities. The Chinese side stands for an early establishment of an independent state of Palestine and encourages democratic elections as well as reforms in the political, financial, economic, judicial and administrative and other areas in Palestine. The Palestinian people's right to choose a political system independently and the legitimate leaders selected by the Palestinian people through democratic elections should be respected. As for the problems that might crop up in the process of implementing the "road map," the two sides should seek negotiated settlement on the principles of openness, consultation on the basis of equality, mutual understanding, accommodation, and tackling the easier problems first.
3. In order to ensure the fulfillment of the "road map" plan, a fair, authoritative and effective international supervisory mechanism should be set up as early as possible. 
4. On the basis of the relevant UN resolutions, the principle of "land for peace" laid down at the Madrid Peace Conference and the agreements and consensus reached by all parties, it is essential to resume the negotiations between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon at an early date in a bid to arrive at a final solution acceptable to all parties and to eventually bring about a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. 
5. It is the shared responsibility and duty of the international community to bring about peace and stability in the Middle East. The international community should give more attention and input to the Middle East problem. The United Nations should play a bigger role. China proposes that an international conference on the Middle East be convened as soon as possible with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned. China is ready to get actively involved in the international efforts to promote the Middle East peace process.

Background
The Mediterranean island's 260,000 inhabitants voted by a tiny margin to reject the plans in a referendum on July 6th, 2003.

Sarkozy declared this defeat on television and said that the right winged central government accepts this result. However, he immediately announced that Paris will put down separatist riots.
The Corsicans were being offered a new national assembly with tax-raising and greater control over public services, in a bid to end 30 years of separatist violence.
Sarkozy declared on July 4th that Collona, the most notorious separist had been arrested in Corsica Island. He was wanted in connection with the murder of the most senior French official on Corsica, Claude Erignac, in 1998.

A special US team rescued Jessica Lynch from an Iraqi hospital on April 1, 2003. Lynch eventually returned to her home in Palestine, West Virginia to recuperate. She became an instant celebrity and a popular symbol of American heroism. 
Background
The Post reported that an Iraqi lawyer, Mohammed Odeh Al-Rehaief, gave vital information to the rescue team, putting his own life in danger to help rescue Lynch. Lynch received an honorable discharge from the Army due to medical disability in August 2003. She is engaged to marry a fellow soldier. After Lynch's rescue, Mohammed Odeh Al-Rehaief moved with his family to the United States, where he was granted political asylum. 
Today, the spectacular rescue of the US Army on April 2nd is exposed as propaganda. At night, US soldiers stormed the hospital in which Lynch was treated. The whole action was filmed. The Iraqi doctors in Nassirija reported they had offered to hand over Lynch before the hospital was taken over. The spectacular military action in the hospital was not necessary. Hours before the US attack, not one single armed person remained in the hospital.

Topic Explication
A group of representatives from the world's largest and most important museums along with UNESCO joined to appeal to US authorities to seal Iraq's borders to prevent the flow of antiquities that were looted from the National Museum in Baghdad. Delegates also urged the UN security council to ban the trade in Iraqi artifacts. The meeting was held at the British Museum and included representatives from the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Hermitage, and the Berlin Museums. 
Background
After the fall of the Iraqi Government, the National Museum in Baghdad was looted and countless priceless archaeological treasures were lost or destroyed. Also affected by the pillaging were a museum in Mosul and Baghdad's Islamic Library. Because the area, Ancient Mesopotamia, was the birthplace of civilization, the museums held priceless ancient collections. US troops have been criticized for failing to prevent and doing very little to stop the looting. These incidents of theft are considered to be the greatest disaster to a national collection since World War II.

Topic Explication
In a recent report by al-Jazeera, three Iraqis were killed and a few others wounded. According to witnesses American helicopters and warplanes fired missiles at houses in the Fallujah area.

Background
Ever since the end of the war and the occupation of American led forces, there have been separatists using guerilla style tactics to thwart US plans to stabilize Iraq. In recent times areas in Fallujah have experienced a surge in such attacks and American forces retaliated to quell the uprising.
The rise in separatist attacks was as a result of a "friendly fire" incident that took place some time ago in which nine Iraqi policemen died.

WHERE: Moscow, Russia

Topic Explication
On June 9 Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Igor Ivanov held talks with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Silvan Shalom, who arrived in Moscow for a working visit. 
The minister stressed that the current movement towards peace should become all-embracing and cover not only the Palestinian-Israeli, but also the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli negotiating tracks. 
It was reiterated that Russia in cooperation with all the concerned parties would continue to endeavor consistently to achieve a settlement in the Middle East which will ensure the peaceful and secure coexistence of two states - Israel and Palestine - and reliable stability for all countries and peoples of the region. 
Silvan Shalom, in his turn, briefed on Israel's approaches to the present Middle East situation. He pointed out the readiness of the Israeli government to move towards a settlement based on the Road Map, and noted the importance of a continued active Russian role in efforts to get over the crisis. Other pressing international problems of mutual concern were examined, including the situation around Iraq. Russia, Ivanov noted, welcomes the restoration of the unity of the UN Security Council on the "Iraq question" and presumes that the adoption of resolution 1483 creates an international legal basis for the return of Iraq to normal life as a responsible and full-fledged member of the world community. 

Background
During the exchange of views, the main focus was on the situation in the Middle East, where important shifts are now evident.Ivanov laid emphasis on the need for the speediest overcoming of the Israeli-Palestinian standoff and for switching the conflict onto a political settlement track on the basis of the Road Map drafted by the Quartet of international mediators - Russia, the US, EU and UN. Now, when both the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships have formally approved this document, it is necessary to promote its practical realization as quickly as possible in the spirit of the positive outcome of the summits in Sharm el-Sheikh and Akaba. In discussing the entire range of Russian-Israeli ties, Ivanov and Shalom reiterated a mutual striving towards the buildup of many-sided cooperation and towards filling it with a new qualitative content, which corresponds to the long-term interests of our
two countries and serves the cause of creating a solid foundation of peace and stability in the Middle East.

55215.  Jerusalem: Bus suicide bombing 
Seminal Event 


WHO:  Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.
WHAT: a suicide bomber blew up a public bus in Jerusalem killing at least 20 people, injuring around 100.
WHEN: 08/19/2003
WHERE: Jerusalem

Topic Explication
A suicide bomber blew up a nearly-full bus in downtown Jerusalem, killing at least 20 people, many of them children, and wounding some 100 on Tuesday night. 
The radical group Islamic Jihad (holy war) claimed responsibility for the attack. The group had previously vowed revenge for the killing of its senior official Mohammed Sidr on Aug. 14 during his arrest by Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron. The bus ran from the Wailing Wall to the ultra-Orthodox MeaSheari neighborhood. Israeli Channel One TV reported that the police were checking the possibility that the bomber was disguised as an ultra-Orthodox Jew. 
Background
The group had previously vowed revenge for the killing of its senior official Mohammed Sidr on Aug. 14 during his arrest by Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron. The bombing, one of the deadliest in Jerusalem in the history, occurred at around 9:20 p.m. (1820 GMT) on bus No. 19 from the Israeli National Bus Company. The site of the bombing was in the Shmuel Hanavi neighborhood, near the Green Line (pre-1967 war border between Israel and the West Bank) separating eastern and western Jerusalem. 
The United States condemned the attack and urged the Palestinians to dismantle their terrorist organizations. "We condemn this act of terrorism in the strongest possible terms," White House spokesman Sean McCormack said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families." This was not the first attack since Palestinian militant groups declared a temporary cease-fire on June 29. 
On Aug. 12, two Israelis were killed in near-simultaneous suicide attacks, one in the West Bank settlement of Ariel and the other in the town of Rosh Ha'ayin, close to the Green Line. Hamas said it was behind the Ariel attack, saying it was in response to the deaths of three of its activists during an Israeli raid in Nablus. The Fatah-linked Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the Rosh Ha'ayin attack. Following Tuesday's fresh suicide attack, Israel has said it will freeze all security talks and the withdrawal of its troops from any more West Bank cities. Earlier on Tuesday Israel has decided to continue talks with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on transferring security control of four West Bank cities, saying that two of the four cities, Qalqilyah and Jericho, will be handed over to PNA this week, and the other two, TulKarm and Ramallah,are expected to be handed over to Palestinian control next week.

55220.  Kuwaiti women allowed symbolic suffrage 
Seminal Event 


WHO: women in Kuwait
WHAT: Kuwaiti women were allow to vote symbolically for the first time in history.
WHEN: 07/05/2003
WHERE: Kuwait

Topic Explication
During the 10th Kuwaiti parliamentarian election, Kuwaiti women, for the first time in history, were allowed to vote symbolically. A large number of Kuwati women turned out at the polling stations on July 5th, hopeful that their symbolic action might make a difference in securing their future political rights. 
Background
In Kuwait, only men who inherit the Kuwaiti citizenship vote or run for elections. This means that Kuwaiti women are without political rights. They neither vote nor run for elections. A group within the population known as Bidouns have resided in Kuwait for generations but are deprived of the country's citizenship. They are also deprived of political rights. Finally, the vast majority of the residents of Kuwait, immigrants, are also deprived of their political rights as they never get the Kuwaiti citizenship, only about 50 people a year did in the past. Thus, Kuwaiti parliamentarian elections are really nothing but maintaining the grip of the privileged few (about 137,000 men over 18) on the overwhelming majority of the population: women, Bidouns, and immigrants (about 2 million people). 
In a makeshift booth at the Kuwait Journalists' Association, young and old, veiled and unveiled, the women trickled in and out to cast their ballots in a parallel election to the country's 10th legislative election, in which they are barred from taking part. 
By 1:00 pm (1000 GMT), monitors said more than 300 women had voted and that the late afternoon would draw many more who work in the mornings. 

Meanwhile, polling stations across the country were hosting the 136,715 men qualified to vote out of a population of 898,000. 
In contradiction to the 1962 constitution, which guarantees equal status for both sexes, only Kuwaiti males over 21 and naturalized males who have been citizens for at least 20 years are eligible to vote in Kuwait's 40-year-old democracy.

Topic Explication
Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress and AAPP's current president, gave the keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 4th General Assembly of the Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace in Manila. In his speech, Wu Bangguo noted that China is a member of Asian community and knows fully well its important responsibility for peace in Asia. This visit to the Philippines marked the beginning of his 3-nation Asian tour, which will include the Republic of Korea and Japan. 
Background
Since the founding of New China 50 years ago, China has unswervingly pursued the independent foreign policy of peace, adhered to its solemn commitment of not seeking hegemony, not joining military blocks and nor seeking sphere of influence, and has duly contributed to the promotion and facilitation of peace and development in Asia, he said. 
"The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, of which China is an initiator, have been widely accepted as the basic norms governing international relations," he said. According to Wu, the independent foreign policy of peace is a long-term strategy formulated by the Chinese government in line with the fundamental interests of the people of China and the world. The rationale of the policy is rooted in the Chinese traditional culture and values. "For thousands of years, we in China have been a strong believer in the philosophy that peace is as valuable to the world as harmony is to the people. In the future, no matter how the international situation may change and how strong China's economy will become, we will unswervingly pursue our foreign policy of maintaining world peace and promoting common development," he stressed. In March this year, the Tenth National People's Congress of China held its first session. "The session reconfirmed the country' s development objective of building a well-off society in an all-round way," he said. The Chinese people are now concentrating on development in a bid to quadruple the 2000 GDP by 2020 and bring about a stronger economy, improved democracy, more advanced science and education, a more prosperous culture, a more harmonious society and a better-off life for the people, he said. China cannot develop without peace and stability in Asia. China will continue to enhance friendship with countries in the neighborhood, and adhere to the policy of "making friends and partners with our neighbors," he said. "We will intensify regional cooperation and work closely with our neighbors to bring mutual exchanges and cooperation to a new high and to create an environment of peace, cooperation and harmony in Asia," he said. In conclusion, Wu said that the sacred and lofty goal of peace is part and parcel of the fundamental interests of 3.6 billion Asian people. The theme of this assembly -- Toward A Hundred Years of Peace in Asia -- reflects the common aspirations of the Asian people. "The National People's Congress of China will work proactively with other AAPP members to enhance mutual understanding, friendship, trust and cooperation among people of all countries and make new contribution to a lasting peace and common development in Asia," he said.

55235.  Tom Pappas wins World Track and Field Championship 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Tom Pappas
WHAT: Tom Pappas won the US Championship for decathlon performance with 8784 points. 
WHEN: 06/22/2003
WHERE: USA

Topic Explication
Tom Pappas established himself as the No. 2 decathlete in U.S. history, and a world championship this summer is not a far-fetched dream. Pappas topped his personal best by 200 points with 8,784 to win his second consecutive U.S. decathalon championship. 
Background
During the US Decathlon, Pappas passed Bruce Jenner, Steve Fritz, Chris Huffins and Dave Johnson on the U.S. all-time list. Among Americans, only Dan O'Brien ever scored more. Pappas was especially pleased to pass Jenner. He remembers reading quotes from Jenner after the 2000 Olympic trials about how disappointing it was that U.S. Dec athletes weren't scoring better. ``He was saying with today's technology and all of this, 20 years later we're not scoring more points than he did,'' Pappas said. ``I just felt he was basically saying that decathletes in the U.S. need to step it up. I was happy to get that out of the way and pass him up.''
Pappas' score is just 23 points shy of this year's world-leading 8,807 points set by Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic three weeks ago. Pappas is just 107 points off O'Brien's America record of 8,891 set 11 years ago. In August, the quiet American heads to Paris for the world championships as Sebrle's chief rival in the event whose champion earns the title ``world's greatest athlete.'' ``I definitely think I have the ability to beat him,'' Pappas said. ``It's just a matter of putting it together on those two days.''2004: 2nd at Olympic Trials (8,517 points) at Olympic Games due to a foot injury (6182) 2nd at Gotzis (8732).

55236.  NASA Safety Panel Members Resign 
Seminal Event 


WHO: nine of NASA Safety Panel members
WHAT: resignation because of the Columbia Accident
WHEN: 09/23/2003
WHERE: Washington

Topic Explication
Nine experts on a NASA space safety advisory panel have resigned in the wake of sharp criticism from the Columbia accident investigation board and by Congress, the space agency said. The members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel and two staff members of the panel sent letters of resignation to NASA administrator Sean O'Keefe. Glen Mahone, a NASA spokesman, said that the resignations were accepted and NASA is now in the process of evaluating the structure of the safety panel. 
Background
The ASAP was established after the 1967 Apollo 1 fire which took the lives of three astronauts. That was the first major accident in the American space program. Members include space engineers, scientists, former aerospace industry executives and military officers. 
In the wake of the Columbia accident, which killed seven astronauts on Feb. 1, the safety panel was criticized by members of Congress as being ineffective. 
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board said in its report that the ASAP lacked influence. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee said the ASAP failed to spot potential danger signs in the operation of the space shuttle and that NASA should reconstitute the panel. 
McCarty told the New York Times that the panel felt "a very big sense of frustration." Mahone said NASA already has started the process ``to revise the panel's charge based on congressional reaction to the findings of the CAIB." He said NASA ``will review the original 1967 charge (that established the safety panel) and its amendments."

55237.  WHO removes Singapore from list of SARS-affected areas 
Seminal Event 


WHO: WHO
WHAT: WHO removes Singapore from the list of SARS epidemic area
WHEN: 05/31/03
WHERE: Singapore

Topic Explication
The World Health Organization (WHO) has removed Singapore from the list of countries with recent local transmission of SARS. The WHO deleted Singapore from list after the country went more than 20 days without reporting a locally-acquired case. The organization said the 20-day period represented twice the maximum incubation period - a reliable indication, following established epidemiological principles, that a chain of transmission has been broken. 
Background
Singapore was initially scheduled to come off the list on May 11, but in what the WHO described as an outstanding example of prompt and open reporting the country's announced a new case on the same day.
From the start, Singapore's handling of its SARS outbreak has been exemplary, said David Heymann, executive director for communicable diseases at WHO. The WHO said that although continued vigilance was necessary to prevent the importation of cases, it no longer recommended exit screening of international travelers departing from Singapore. The absence of local transmission for twice the incubation period means that neither residents nor travelers are at risk of acquiring SARS in Singapore. 
Singapore welcomed the announcement and said it remained committed to a long-term fight against the virus. "Notwithstanding the WHO announcement, there will be no pause in our efforts to isolate and contain the disease and to prevent any export of the disease beyond our shores, said a Ministry of Health spokesperson. We will continue to maintain the highest level of vigilance, especially at all our border checkpoints, at our hospitals and healthcare facilities, schools and tertiary institutions and all government and other premises."

55238.  Panda Theme park in Cheng Du, China 
Seminal Event 


WHO: New park for Panda
WHAT: New park for Panda will be built 
WHEN: 04/28/2003
WHERE: South China 

Topic Explication
The city of Chengdu has announced that a giant panda park will be constructed in the district. The park will cover some 230-plus acres and will house forty of the bears, making it the largest group of pandas in captivity in any one place. The cost of the park is reportedly estimated at 70,000,000 dollars. 
Background
Giant pandas, a unique branch of the bear family, are dwindling. Their consistent lack of interest in captive reproduction has taken its toll on conservation efforts. Wild pandas, meanwhile, are still hunted by poachers for their pelts, which can bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars. This park, although the tourism possibilities have certainly not gone unnoticed, will provide a compromise between wild and captive lives for the bears. They will be in a mostly-natural environment, but they will be contained and protected. In addition to this, there will be sufficient numbers of pandas to provide adequate genetic variety, which has been a problem for captive panda breeding programs.
China is home to all wild pandas and a majority of the captive ones, which are loaned to international zoos. This process generates millions of dollars per year for the Chinese government. In addition to the proposed park, China also contains more than forty panda reserves, five protected "corridors," and has laws which mandate the death penalty for panda poachers.

WHAT: Uganda will host a conference for people living with HIV/AIDS
WHEN: Kickoff is 04/24/2003; Conference is 10/26-30/2003
WHERE: Kampala, Uganda

Topic Explication
It was announced that the 11th international conference for people living with HIV/AIDS will be held in Kampala, Uganda on October 26-30.
The event was planned and organized by both the Global network of People Living with HIV/AIDS and the National Guidance and Empowerment Network of Uganda. 
Background
The International Conferences for People Living with HIV/AIDS are the signature program of the Global Network of People living with HIV/AIDS. They are the only international events where the agenda is completely set by the global community of people living with HIV/AIDS. Initially a European gathering to highlight the need for mutual support, the Conference has become a principal hothouse for policy thinking among leaders with HIV.
The first International Conference for People Living with HIV/AIDS were first launched in 1987 in London. There were only 50 participants, and they were primarily from Western Europe. That meetings theme, Caring for Ourselves, reflected the need to develop a self-help and self-empowerment, network-structured movement of people with HIV. At that time, GNP was called the International Steering Committee of People Living with HIV/AIDS. The Conferences continued on a bi-annual basis, ever broadening their inclusiveness and world perspective, not to mention their attendance.

55245.  Turkish Police seize heroin 
Seminal Event 


WHO: unknown
WHAT: Turkish officials seized a truck about to cross the border into Greece. The truck contained 112 kilos of heroin, a shipment estimated at 9.8 million dollars.
WHEN: 6/16/2003
WHERE: Ipsala, Turkey

Topic Explication
122 kilograms of heroin were hidden in a truck trying to cross the border into Greece from northwestern Turkey. A Turkish canine unit detected the narcotics, and they became police property. The drugs were concealed beneath the seats and under the hood. The 43-year-old Turkish driver was arrested. 
Background
Turkey is a major smuggling route for Asian heroin, especially Afghani and Pakistani heroin. Hundreds of seizures are made every year of heroin destined for Europe or for further transport to America. In 2002, nearly a metric ton (1,000 kg) of heroin was intercepted by Turkish border agencies. Considering the global efficiency of heroin detection, the amount of heroin that does get through, by concealment or bribery, must be staggering.
The picture is complicated by the reports that the Turkish government actively encourages the drug trade and skims off some of the profits. Turkish drug smugglers, who frequently do not even attempt to hide their profession, have reportedly stated that they are working under the aegis of the Turkish government, allegations which have been denied. If this is in fact the case, the shipments being intercepted by border police may represent unsanctioned smuggling operations or concessions to foreign pressure to crack down on drugs. 
If the seizures do represent a legitimate attempt to crack down on heroin smuggling, Turkey is still a worrisome problem. The amounts of heroin seized are increasing. Against a backdrop of frequent 5-20 kilogram siezures come the big busts, which are getting larger. In January of 2004, following a record seizure of a literal ton of uncut heroin, Turkish officials reported seizures of 3,600 kilograms of heroin in 11 months. There is not much evidence to suggest that police have become more efficient in intercepting shipments, so it can not be ignored that this increased tonnage might result from more drug shipments rather than better detection.

55246.  Russian strategic bomber crash 
Seminal Event 


WHO: Four crew members
WHAT: All four crew members aboard a Tupolev-16 0 Russian strategic bomber were killed as the p lane crashed during a test flight.
WHEN: 09/18/2003
WHERE: Crash: near the Saratov region, south of Moscow

Topic Explication
A Russian Tupolev-160 strategic bomber crashed at 12 PM on September 18 while testing a newly replaced engine. The crash occured 700 km south of Moscow and claimed the lives of the four crew members aboard. The crash was attributed to mechanical failure, specifically, an engine fire. The bomber was not armed at the time of the crash. 
Background
Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev was the USSR's most prominent aeronautical engineer. In 1922, he was tapped to create the Soviet Union's aerospace laboratory, which would be called the Tupolev OKB (Special Construction Bureau). He revolutionized the Soviet air force, creating more than 100 new aircraft designs. His bureau would be responsible for almost every advance in Soviet aircraft to come, including the first supersonic jets and the creation of the Soviet shuttle program. It combined the functions of McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed, Boeing, and NASA. The Tupolev corporation today is a continuation of his bureau.
The Tu-160 was one of the last important designs put into production before the OKB was privatized in the 1990s. It was the Soviet answer to the American Rockwell B-1 Lancer, a similar supersonic bomber. The design of the Tu-160, designated "Blackjack" by NATO, was superior to the American plane. The Tu-160 had variable-geometry wings like the Lancer, but it had more room, more payload, and more range. Four of the most powerful engines ever put on a combat aircraft were attached to the wings. The bomber was to be used as a mobile launch platform for strategic missiles and bombs. 
As of 2001, Russia had more than a dozen of the planes, eight operational and one under construction. At least one had been converted into a non-military satellite launch platform. 19 Tu-160s were in the Ukraine, where they had been stationed when the Ukraine gained its independence from its larger neighbor. Russia continues to negotiate for their return. There are several proposed variations of the Tu-160, including its use as a super-long-range strike fighter and upgrading it to be able to launch the newest cruise missiles, that look to extend the Tu-160's lifespan.

Seminal Event 


WHO: Teenager
WHAT: Crocodile kills teenager in Kruger National Park, South Africa. 
WHEN: 09/30/2003
WHERE: Kruger National Park, South Africa

Topic Explication
A crocodile killed a teenage boy in South Africa's Kruger National Park on September 30, 2003. The 17 year-old Cork village native was fishing with friends in the Sabie River when the attack occurred. His friends alerted rangers and police officers, who spotted the boy in the crocodile's jaws, and fired a few shots at the animal. Ramond Travers, a park official, estimated that the boy may have died before the crocodile released his body. A rescue team searched for the boy's body for hours, until finally finding it at 7:30 Tuesday evening. The boy's name was not released, as all his kin had not been notified. 
Background
Park officials in the Kruger National Park expressed regrets and condolences to the family of the 17 year-old who was killed by the crocodile. However, Ramond Travers also reminded the public that fishing in national park rivers is an offense, and that the waters in the park are infested with crocodiles and hippopotamus, both of which are very dangerous animals.

Topic Explication
Two journalists accompanied prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on his brief trip last weekend to Beijing. Upon their return, they were told by their employers that they must take enforced leave and were barred from returning to their workplaces for ten days. Raffarin and his aides all returned to work. 
Background
French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin made an official visit to the People's Republic of China on April 25 and 26, 2003. He is the first Western leader to visit China since the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.
Two journalists, who accompanied prime minister Raffarin on his brief trip to Beijing, were "quarantined" by their employers for 10 days upon their return from China. The two, though they reported that they had no symptoms of SARS, were not been placed in official quarantine, nor did they face any restrictions on movement or even an obligation to see a doctor. The Prime Minister Raffarin responded by issuing a more global criticism, condemning the "exclusion" and "ostracism" that SARS panic is causing.

Topic Explication
A senior leader of the armed wing of Hamas and six others were killed in northern Gaza City by an Israeli helicopter strike. The leader, Tito Massoud, was a senior member of the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades from Jabaliya, north of Gaza Strip. Massoud was the main target as he was the first in command in manufacturing the Al Qassam rocket, which they used to strike Israeli land. The strike came half an hour after the suicide-bomber attack in West Jerusalem, which targeted a bus and killed 17, including the attacker. 
Background
The helicopter strike came half an hour after Israel made a public commitment to "completely wipe out" Hamas and its leaders. The attack was made in retaliation for a suicide bombing in Jerusalem which left 17 dead. Israel had been targeting members of the Hamas group and killing them with helicopter strikes as their tactic of choice.
