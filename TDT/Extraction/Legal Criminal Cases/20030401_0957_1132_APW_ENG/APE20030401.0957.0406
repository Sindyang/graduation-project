Thousands
of
people
gathered
outside
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
on
Tuesday
for
the
most
eagerly
awaited
arguments
of
the
session
:
two
cases
that
could
rewrite
rules
for
affirmative
action
.
The
court
was
hearing
back-to-back
arguments
asking
how
and
whether
race
can
be
a
factor
when
public
colleges
and
universities
choose
their
students
.
More
broadly
,
the
cases
stemming
from
the
University
of
Michigan
's
admissions
policies
ask
wrenching
legal
and
constitutional
questions
about
equality
,
fairness
,
opportunity
and
U.S.
history
.
The
court
's
ruling
,
expected
by
July
,
could
effectively
end
any
state-sponsored
affirmative
action
,
or
it
could
rewrite
the
rules
for
when
race
may
be
a
factor
in
government
decisions
.
The
last
time
the
court
visited
the
issue
was
25
years
ago
,
in
University
of
California
v.
Bakke
.
That
fractured
ruling
struck
down
quota
systems
but
left
some
room
for
race
to
be
a
factor
in
university
admissions
.
Michigan
and
its
law
school
give
extra
credit
to
minority
applicants
,
making
it
more
likely
that
a
black
,
Hispanic
or
Native
American
will
edge
out
a
white
applicant
who
has
similar
test
scores
,
grades
or
other
attributes
.
More
than
100
friend
of
the
court
filings
rolled
in
during
the
weeks
preceding
arguments
.
Lawyers
could
not
remember
another
case
that
generated
more
.
In
another
sign
of
the
case
's
importance
,
the
high
court
will
release
an
audio
tape
immediately
after
the
two-hour
arguments
.
It
is
only
the
second
time
the
court
has
done
so
.
The
first
time
was
the
presidential
election
cases
in
2000
.
The
Rev.
Jesse
Jackson
,
a
civil
rights
leader
,
was
among
speakers
outside
the
court
Tuesday
,
where
the
crowd
estimated
by
police
at
5,000
to
7,000
people
was
decidedly
pro-affirmative
action
.
``
There
are
more
blacks
in
prison
than
in
college
.
Young
America
,
fight
back
,
''
Jackson
said
.
Many
people
bore
signs
and
chanted
slogans
supporting
affirmative
action
.
``
They
say
Jim
Crow
,
we
say
hell
no
,
''
one
group
of
demonstrators
chanted
.
Jim
Crow
laws
discriminate
against
blacks
.
The
term
comes
from
an
18th
century
Kentucky
plantation
song
.
Police
barricaded
the
plaza
and
steps
in
front
of
the
court
,
keeping
protesters
on
the
sidewalk
.
``
Affirmative
action
helped
me
,
and
I
'm
here
to
support
students
from
all
over
the
country
,
''
said
Rosa
Clemente
of
New
York
City
.
``
The
Supreme
Court
needs
to
do
the
right
thing
and
support
affirmative
action
,
''
added
Clemente
,
who
described
herself
as
a
``
black
Puerto
Rican
''
with
degrees
from
the
State
University
of
New
York
at
Albany
and
Cornell
University
.
The
University
of
Michigan
and
its
supporters
contend
that
a
diverse
student
body
is
a
worthy
goal
that
benefits
all
students
.
Government
,
in
this
case
a
public-funded
university
,
has
what
the
Supreme
Court
has
called
a
compelling
interest
in
furthering
that
goal
,
the
school
argues
.
Three
white
students
who
challenged
the
Michigan
policies
frame
their
argument
in
stark
terms
:
It
is
not
fair
for
a
student
to
win
a
coveted
place
on
campus
just
because
he
or
she
is
a
minority
.
``
I
was
treated
unfairly
because
of
my
skin
color
,
''
said
Jennifer
Gratz
,
a
white
student
rejected
by
the
university
.
``
Court
records
show
that
if
I
had
been
black
,
Hispanic
or
Native
American
,
I
would
have
had
a
nearly
100
percent
chance
of
admission
with
my
grades
and
record
.
''
The
cases
directly
address
only
admissions
at
public
,
tax-supported
institutions
,
but
the
court
's
rationale
is
expected
to
have
a
wide
ripple
through
private
colleges
and
universities
,
other
government
decision-making
and
the
business
world
.
